This is Berk. It's twelve days north of Hopeless, and a few degrees south of Freezing to Death.
It's located solidly on the Meridian of Misery.
My village. In a word, sturdy. And it's been here for seven generations, but, every single building is new. We have fishing, hunting, and a charming view of the sunsets.
-dragons. Most people would leave. Not us. We're Vikings. We have stubbornness issues. (Hiccup runs outdoors, where all the houses are on fire and Vikings are tussling with dragons all around) My name's Hiccup. Great name, I know. But, it's not the worst. Parents believe a hideous name will frighten off gnomes and trolls. Like our charming Viking demeanor wouldn't do that.
That's Stoick the Vast. Chief of the tribe. They say that when he was a baby, he popped a dragon's head clean off of its shoulders. (Stoick throws a wooden cart at a dragon, knocking it out mid-air) Do I believe it? Yes, I do.
What, who me? Nah, come on! I'm waaaay too muscular for their taste. They wouldn't know what to do with all... (gestures to his skinny body) ...this.
The meat-head with attitude and interchangeable hands is Gobber. I've been his apprentice ever since I was little. Well... littler.
See? Old village, lots and lots of new houses.
Oh, and that's Fishlegs, Snotlout, the Twins, Ruffnut and Tuffnut, and... (dreamily) Astrid. Oh, their job is so much cooler. (Slow motion shot of the teens walking away from an explosion)
Oh, come on. Let me out, please? I need to make my mark!
Please, two minutes. I'll kill a dragon. My life will get infinitely better. I might even get a date.
Okay, fine, but this will throw it for me.
Mild calibration issue--
But, you just pointed to all of me!
You sir, are playing a dangerous game. Keeping this much, raw... Viking-ness... contained? THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES!
One day, I'll get out there. Because, killing a dragon is everything around here.
A Nadder head is sure to get me at least noticed. Gronckles are tough. Taking down one of those would definitely get me a girlfriend. A Zippleback? Exotic. Two heads, twice the status.
And then, there's the Monstrous Nightmare. Only the best Vikings go after those. They have this nasty habit of setting themselves on fire.
But the ultimate prize is the dragon no one has ever seen. We call it the--
This thing never steals food, never shows itself, and... never misses. No one has ever killed a Night Fury. That's why I'm going to be the first.
Yeah, I know! Be right back!
Come on. Gimme something to shoot at, gimme something to shoot at.
Oh, and there's one more thing you need to know...
Sorry, Dad.
(sheepish)'Okay, but I hit a Night Fury.
Between you and me, the village could do with a little less feeding, don't ya think? (A viking at the back rubs his stomach as if to say "Are you calling me fat?")
I can't stop myself. I see a dragon and I have to just... kill it, you know? It's who I am, Dad.
Thank you, thank you. I was trying, so...I really did hit one.
He never listens.
And when he does, it's always with this... disappointed scowl. Like someone skimped on the meat in his sandwich. [Imitating Stoick] Excuse me, barmaid! I'm afraid you brought me the wrong offspring. I ordered an extra large boy with beefy arms. Extra guts and glory on the side. This here, this is a talking fish bone!
[Sarcastically] Thank you for summing that up.
I just want to be one of you guys.
Oh, the gods hate me. Some people lose their knife or their mug. No, not me. I manage to lose an ENTIRE DRAGON?!
(stops halfway up the stairs) Dad! Uh... I have to talk to you, Dad.
No, no, you go first.
[Panicking] Oh, man, I should've gone first! Uh, 'cause I was thinking, you know, we have a surplus of dragon-fighting Vikings, but do we have enough... bread-making Vikings, or small home repair Vikings--?
I don't want to fight dragons.
Rephrase: Dad, I can't kill dragons.
No, I'm really very extra sure that I won't.
Can you not hear me?!
You just gestured to all of me.
This conversation is feeling very one-sided.
And I'll be here. Maybe.
[Sarcastically] Yeah, no kidding, right? Pain. Love it.
A doctor?!
So, I guess it's just you and me, huh?
[weighing the bola with his hands] So, why didn't you?
So I guess we'll share?
All mine then. Wow, okay. So, I'll see you, uh... [Door slams] tomorrow.
Dragon classifications. Strike Class, Fear Class, Mystery Class.
You know, I just happened to notice the book had nothing on Night Furies. Is there another book? Or a sequel? Maybe a little Night Fury pamphlet?
Hey, so how would one sneak up on a Night Fury?
I know, I know, but hypothetically--
They probably take the daytime off. You know, like a cat. Has anyone ever seen one napping?
Just... let me... why don't you...
Huh. Toothless. I could've sworn you had...
Hey, Toothless. I brought breakfast. I hope you're hungry. Okay, that's disgusting. Uh... we've got some salmon, some nice Icelandic cod, and a whole smoked eel.
AAAAAGGGGHHHHH! Yeah!
[On edge] Will you please stop that?!
Oh, come on!
Back! Back! Back! BACK! Now, don't you make me tell you again! Yes, that's right! Back into your cage. Now think about what you've done.
I left my axe back in the ring. You guys go on ahead. I'll catch up with you.
Oh, great.
Astrid. Hey! Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid.
Okay there, bud, we're gonna take this nice and slow. Here we go. Here we go... position three, no, four. Alright, it's go time. It's go time. Come on, buddy, come on, buddy! [changes tail fin position] Yes, it worked!
Uh... no thanks. I'm good.
[sketching Toothless] Dad! You're back! Gobber's not here, so...
I... have?
I don't know what you're...
Oh, gods. Dad I'm so sorry. I was going to tell you. I just didn't know how to--
h... you were?
[Sincerely] Wow. Thanks.
I should really get to bed.
So, later.
I'm kinda late for--
[Sarcastically] Heh. Oh, yeah! Yes! I can't wait. I am so...
...LEAVING! We're leaving. Let's pack up. Looks like you and me are taking a little vacation, forever. Ah, man... Aggh! What the-- What are you doing here?
Uh... training?
I know this looks really bad, but you see...this is, uh... You're right! You're right! You're right. I'm through with the lies. I've been making... outfits. So, you got me. It's time everyone knew. Drag me back. Go ahead. Here we go.
[In pain] Oh, man.
NO! No. It's okay! It's okay... she's a friend. It's okay. You just scared him.
Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid.
Da, da-da! We're dead!
You have to give me a chance to explain.
Then I won't speak. Just let me show you. Please, Astrid.
Toothless, down. Gently. See? Nothing to be afraid of.
Don't remind me.
I don't know. Toothless. You've got to get us out of here, bud.
What my dad wouldn't give to find this.
[Sarcastically] It's satisfying to know that all of our food has been dumped down a hole.
Alright, buddy, we gotta get out of here. Now!
No, no! Not yet. They'll... kill Toothless. Astrid, we have to think this through carefully.
Just give me until tomorrow. I'll figure something out.
What are you looking at?
(Glances at Stoick) It's not the dragon I'm worried about.
Put an end to this.
I'm ready.
It's okay. It's okay. [throws helmet onto floor] I'm not one of them.
No! I need you all to see this. They're not what we think they are. We don't have to kill them.
Alright, Toothless, go. Get out of here!
No, Dad, he won't hurt you!
No! Please, jus-- just don't hurt him! Please don't hurt him.
I know we did... But that was before... Ugh, it's all so messed up!
I screwed up. I should have told you before now. Take this out on me, be mad at me, but please... just don't hurt Toothless.
He was just protecting me! He's not dangerous.
AND WE'VE KILLED THOUSANDS OF THEM! They defend themselves, that's all! They raid us because they have to! If they don't bring enough food back, they'll be eaten themselves. There's something else on their island, Dad... it's a dragon like--
Did I say nest?
No... I didn't. Toothless did. Only a dragon can find the island.
Thank you for summing that up. Why couldn't I have killed that dragon when I found him in the woods? It would have been better for everyone.
I don't know. I couldn't.
Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?
Oh, for the love of-- I was a coward! I was weak! I wouldn't kill a dragon!
Whatever! I wouldn't! Three hundred years, and I'm the first Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon!
...I wouldn't kill him because he looked as frightened as I was. I looked at him, and I saw myself.
Eh, probably something stupid.
Then something crazy!
I didn't...
Relax. It's okay... it's okay. [Snotlout bonds with the Nightmare]
You're going to need something to help you hold on.
Ruff, Tuff, watch your backs! Move, Fishlegs!
Up, let's move it!
Fishlegs, break it down!
Okay! Lout, Legs, hang in its blind spot! Make some noise, keep it confused! Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has a shot limit! Make it mad!
Just do what I told you! I'll be back as soon as I can!
Yeah, me too.
We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard.
Thanks, Dad.
Did you get her?
That thing has wings! Okay, let's see if it can use them!
Okay, Toothless, time to disappear! Come on, bud!
Oh, hey, Toothless. I'm happy to see you too, buddy. [Toothless steps on his groin] OW! What-- Uh, I'm in my house. You're in my house! Uh... does my dad know you're in here?!
I knew it. I'm dead.
You just gestured to all of me.
I might make a few tweaks.
What, is it always going to be this way? Cause...
You ready?
This... is Berk. It snows nine months of the year, and hails the other three. Any food that grows here is tough and tasteless. The people that grow here are even more so. The only upsides are the pets. While other places have...ponies or parrots, we have... dragons!
Life here is amazing, just not for the faint of heart. See, where most folks enjoy hobbies like whittling or needlepoint, we Berkians prefer a little something we like to call--
DRAGON RACING!
(V.O.) Dragons used to be a bit of a problem here. But that was five years ago. Now, they've all moved in. And, really, why wouldn't they?
(V.O.) We have custom stables... all-you-can-eat feeding stations... a full-service dragon wash... Even top-of-the-line fire prevention, if I do say so myself.
Yep. Berk is pretty much perfect. All of my hard work has paid off. And it's a good thing, too, because with Vikings on the backs of dragons, the world just got a whole lot bigger.
What do you think, bud? Wanna give this another shot?
Toothless! It'll be fine.
This is amazing!
No longer amazing! Toothless!
Oh, no! AHH!
That really came out of nowhere.
We gotta work on your solo flying there, bud. That locked-up tail makes for some pretty sloppy rescue maneuvers, eh?
Oh. Looks like we found another one, bud.
Oh, what? Do you want an apology? Is that why you're pouting, big baby boo? Well... try this on! [Hugs him, tries to wrestle with him] Ya feeling it yet? Huh? Picking up on all of my heartfelt remorse?
(Groans) Oh, come on. You wouldn't hurt a one legged-- AHH!
You're right! You're right! You win! You win! 
Whoa, whoa, whoa! [Playing with Toothless] He's down! And it's ugly! Dragons and Vikings, enemies again, locked in combat to the bitter--[Toothless pins Hiccup] --URFFF! 
(Groans) Gaaaaagh! You KNOW that doesn't wash out.
So what should we name it?
"Itchy Armpit" it is. Whaddya reckon, bud? Think we might find a few Timberjacks in those woods? The odd Whispering Death or two in the rocks? Who knows... maybe we'll finally track down another Night Fury. Wouldn't that be something? So, whaddya say? Just keep going?
Afternoon, milady. Where have you been?
Avoiding my dad.
Oh, you're gonna love this. I wake up. The sun's shining. Terrible Terrors are singing on the rooftop. I saunter down to breakfast, thinking all is right with the world and I get: [Imitating Stoick] "Son, we need to talk."
Okay, first of all, I don't sound like that. What is this character? And second... what is that thing you're going with my shoulders?
A truly flattering impersonation. Anyway he goes: [Imitating Stoick] "You're the pride of Berk, son, and I couldn't be prouder..."
[Laughing] WHEN have I ever done that with my hands?
Okay... just... hold still. It's very serious.
"You're all grown up, and since no chief could ask for a better successor, I've decided--"
[winds the fin back into his flight suit] You're gonna wear out the spring coil. The calibration is very sensitive! 
Yeah, so... this is what I'm dealing with.
I didn't. By the time he turned around, I was gone.
It's not me, Astrid. All those speeches, and planning, and running the village... that's his thing. 
I'm not like you. You know exactly who you are. You always have. But... I'm still looking. I know that I'm not my father... and I never met my mother.... so, what does that make me?
Maybe. But, y'know... there is something out there.
(To Astrid) Stay close.
What happened here?
Easy, bud.
Astrid! Look out!
Look, we don't want any trouble.
You think we did this?
What do-gooder-- there are other dragon riders?
Drago what-fist? Does anything you say make sense?
Look, we don't know anything about a dragon thief, or an ice-spitting dragon,
Or your lunatic boss and his dragon army, okay? Just give us back our dragon and we'll go, Strange-Hostile-Person-Whom-We've-Never-Met.
And this is Toothless. He says we're going. Now.
Sorry. Got held up.
Hey, Dad, could I have a word?
Not quite the itch you're thinking of, but yes.
Could we just talk in private for--
If we could just talk--
Dad, this is actually a little more important than building saddles.
Look can we just talk?
But, seriously, I really need to tell you about this new land we came across.
We didn't stick around to find out. These folks weren't particularly friendly.
No, this was different. Not the standard run-for-the hills hoo-ha I've come to enjoy. These guys were trappers. Dragon trappers.
I've never seen anything like it. And worst of all, they thought we did it!
[Turns off saw] They are building a dragon army. Or-or at least the guy they work for is. Uh, "Dargo Bloody Fist" or something. 
Uh yeah. Wait. You know him?
What? Why?!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! What is happening?
Because some guy you knew is stirring up trouble in some faraway land?
Then let's ride back out there. We'll follow those trappers to Drago and talk some sense into him.
It's our duty to keep the peace!
War? Dad, if Drago's coming for our dragons, we can’t wait around for him to get here. Let’s go find him and change his mind.
I have to.
Nope. It’s your lucky day. We give up.
That's one Night Fury, one Deadly Nadder and two of the finest dragon riders west of Luk Tuk. That oughtta make the boss happy, right? Excuse us.
Toothless, stay. The dragons don’t really care for cramped spaces, so they’ll just hang out with you. They won’t be any trouble.
Unless you do that. Wooden boat, big ocean-- How's your swimming?
Oops. Almost forgot. Can't have armed prisoners.
Just what every Dragon Trapper needs. One end coats the blade in Monstrous Nightmare saliva.
The other sprays Hideous Zippleback gas. All it takes is a spark and...
Oh, yeah, there you go! Once they see you as one of their own, even the testiest dragon can be trained, right, bud?
No game. We just want to meet Drago.
Because I’m going to change his mind about dragons.
Once you’ve earned his loyalty, there is nothing a dragon won’t do for you.
I can change yours. Right here. Right now. [pushes Toothless' tail lever forward, spreading the prosthetic tail.] May I?
Put me down! Snotlout! What are you doing?
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?!
I DON'T NEED to be rescued!
I’m trying to protect our dragons and stop a war! How is that irresponsible?
I’m still going to try. This is what I’m good at. And if I could change your mind... I can change his, too.
(To Toothless) Come on.
Don’t worry, bud. I’m not gonna let anything happen to you. I promise.
AW, COME ON, DAD! REALLY?! 
(To Toothless) Okay. No sudden moves.
Hold on, hold on.
Toothless!
HEY! YOU LEFT MY DRAGON BACK THERE! HE CAN'T FLY ON HIS OWN! HE'LL DROWN!
We have to head back for my dragon!
Who are you? The Dragon Thief? Drago Bludvist? Do you even understand what I’m saying?
Toothless! It’s okay. I’m glad to see you, too, bud. You really had me worried there.
Uh, should I... should I know you?
Hold on! Wait just a minute!
Come back here!
You can’t just say something like that and run off! You’re my MOTHER?! I mean, what the -- do you grasp how INSANE it sounds?!
I have questions! Where have you been all this time? What've you been doing?! They said you were dead! Everyone thinks you were eaten by... 
This is where you’ve been for twenty years?
You’ve been rescuing them. [Nods again, this time, smiling] Unbelievable. 
What? No. I don't know. It’s a bit much to get my head around, to be frank. It’s not every day you find out your mother is some kind of crazy, feral, vigilante dragon lady.
I suppose there is that... one... specific... thing...
I don’t have the words. 
I found him in the woods. He was shot down and wounded.
[Awkward laugh] Heh. Well, crazy thing is... I’m actually the one who shot him down. (Valka looks on shocked but curious) It’s okay though, he got me back. Right, bud? You couldn’t save all of me, could you? You just had to make it even. So… peg leg!
He didn’t take it all that well. But then... he changed. They all did. Pretty soon everyone back home had dragons of their own.
No, really, I--
Yeah, it runs in the family.
How did you survive?
Wait, that’s the ice-spitter? He’s responsible for all that destruction?
Uh, yeah. I could eat.
Hey, I thought we were going to eat!
And from Dragon Island, I found this archipelago…  
It’s all well and good to call yourself a dragon. But can you fly?
Oh no. Toothless! 
Man! Almost! We just about had it that time! 
Well, not bad yourself.
Did YOU know about this?
Yeah! I mean...that...sounds... amazing! [Valka hugs him] This is so great! Now you and I can go talk to Drago -- together.
But we have to--
Well, bud, we can’t wait around for Drago to attack this place. We’ve gotta find him first.
Are you kidding me? How'd you get in here?
Dad! There’s something you need to know! 
This isn’t an on-the-way kind of update, actually... 
...more of the earth-shattering development variety.
Dad, unlike most surprises I spring on you, this one you’ll like. I promise! You just have to handle it delicately, so.. 
Dad, can you put the sword away... please? 
Mom, you’d never recognize it. Where we used to make weapons, we now build saddles, wing slings -- we even fix dragon teeth. You wouldn’t believe how much everything’s changed.
Thanks, Dad.
And once you move back in, with all your dragons, Drago won’t stand a chance. Everything will be okay!
Oh, gotcha.
Toothless? What’s happening?
Yeah baby!
[To Eret] Welcome aboard, Dragon Rider!
Oh, y'know. Catching up with Mom.
Well, now you know where I get my dramatic flair. [flicks helmet down and breaks right]
There! Come on, Toothless! Show them what you got, bud.
Thatta boy!
Another one?
STOP! Stop! 
All of this loss, and for what? To become unstoppable? To rule the world? Dragons are kind, amazing creatures that can bring people together.
Then why a dragon army?
Or maybe you need dragons to conquer people. To control those who follow you... and to get rid of those who won’t.
The world wants peace. And we have the answer, back on Berk. Just let me show you.
Toothless? You okay, bud? What’s going on?
Uh, what did he just tell you? Toothless, what’s the matter with you? What're you doing? Knock it off! Stop! Snap out of it!
Toothless! No! Toothless! Don’t! 
No... you...
No, no, no. No...
No! Get away from him! GO ON! GET OUT OF HERE! GET AWAY!
Toothless!
I'm sorry, Dad. [All the dragon riders wipe away tears.] I’m not the chief that you wanted me to be. And I'm not the peacekeeper I thought I was. I don’t know…
I was so afraid of becoming my dad. Mostly because I thought I never could. How do you become someone that great? That brave? That selfless? I guess you can only try. (Hiccup's sadness becomes a fierce determination) A chief protects his own. We’re going back.
Not all of them.
They’re babies. They don’t listen to anyone!
Well, it’s a good thing that I never listen.
Get Toothless back and kick Drago’s--
And that thing.
Distract the Alpha. Try to keep his focus off of Toothless.
Toothless? It’s me, bud. It’s me. I’m right here. Come back to me.
It wasn't your fault, bud. They made you do it. You’d never hurt him. You’d never hurt me!
Please. You are my best friend, bud.
My best friend.
Atta boy, that's it! I'm here!
Hang on! Almost there buddy. Almost there!
We need to get those two apart.
We gotta block him out, Toothless. Do you trust me, bud?
We can do this. You and me. As one. That's it. Now let's try this one more time!
Shut it out, Toothless!
Not again. TOOTHLESS! IT'S NOW OR NEVER! Come on, bud!
Yeah! We did it!
Hold him there Toothless! It's all over now.
He's challenging the Alpha!
Now do you get it? This is what it is to earn a dragon’s loyalty. Let this end now.
The Alpha protects them all. 
You never cease to amaze me, bud. Thank you.
Toothless! You know that doesn't wash out.
Y'know, Skullcrusher's gonna need somebody to look after him now.
Thank you. I’m really glad you’re here, mom.
Ha, ha. Still doing that one? That’s hilarious. Come here, you. [Kisses Astrid.]
(V.O) This... is Berk. A bit trampled and busted and covered in ice, but it's home. It's our home. [The camera shows some Vikings working on a giant statue of Stoick.] Those who attacked us are relentless and crazy. But those who stopped them? Oh, even more so! [Astrid swoops past Hiccup laughing, and Hiccup decides to join them] We may be small in numbers, but we stand for something bigger than anything the world can pit against us. [Valka and Gobber are removing the armor from the dragons that Drago captured.] We are the voice of peace. And bit by bit, we will change this world. [Gobber pauses working to fire the black sheep. Astrid and Stormfly get ready to catch it as in the last race, but Hiccup and Toothless grab it from below her.] You see, we have something they don't. Oh sure, they have armies [Toothless flies under the baskets while Hiccup jumps above them, throwing the black sheep into Astrid's basket.] and they have armadas... But we... we have... [All the riders land at the chief's viewing stand.] OUR DRAGONS! [Toothless roars.]
Shhh! Shh, shh, shh! No, no! I'm not a demon! I'm not a demon!
See? Just a guy! Just a guy, here to rescue these dragons, so...
Dragon Scales! Dragons shed a lot.
That's really just a nitwit who forgot to fireproof his butt.
Guys! Too soon. You always come in too soon!
Fishlegs, again with the baby? This is a raid.
Astrid! I had him right where I wanted him.
Okay, we screwed that up. But, at least nobody else knows we're here.
Easy, girl. It's okay. Shh! We're gonna get you out of here.
Get the rescued out of here!
Thank you. Now, go get the rest, bud!
Yeah, they always start that way.
Move out! We got them all!
Toothless! Time to go!
Oh! Hey, guys!
Ha! Ha! You always have my back, bud!
This is Berk. Your new home away from home. A stunning, one-styled, all-expense-paid dream destination. So settle in and let your worries melt away! The service here soars, the cuisine's fiery, and the locals are as colorful as you get.
Any run of the mill paradise boasts beaches and sunshine...
...Well, not us. We've got something no one else can touch. We, my friend, have dragons. Lots - and lots - of dragons!
Gang, meet our latest Berkians.
I think the real hero today was Toothless, isn't that right, bud? What would we do without you, oh, King of Dragons? What would we do?
Hey, bud, do you wanna do something here, or...?
Eh, we'll make room.
We can handle them. We have the Alpha. Ain't that right, bud? Would you look at how happy they are?
Gobber, relax. We did it. The world's first dragon-Viking utopia. We made the dream a reality.
Gobber, you're not fooling anybody. I know you love them.
Okay, okay. I-I'll think about it.
Oh, thank you, Tuffnut. Thank you. So much.
Eret, son of Eret!
What's the report?
So we go after them.
Even...Night Furies?
Those are scary.
Oh, all right. You do know it's not a chew toy, don't you? Is this what you want? Oh, do you want this leg? Do you want my leg? Go get it.
Getting pretty good at gliding on your own, bud.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
R-Really? You think you and I should...
No, that's... that's crazy.
It does seem like the whole world knows about us now.
There might be. Dad used to talk about an old mariners' myth. Of a secret land at the edge of the world, where dragons lived totally out of reach.
True. But what if it's real? It could be the answer to all of our problems.
Uh-uh. All of us.
Well, we could just take Gobber's advice and tie the knot. That should fix everything. But, hey, if you're having doubts about yours truly, I'm pretty sure Snotlout's available.
Oh! Playing dirty now, huh?
Oh, how dare you! (grabs Astrid and tickles her) That is a low blow. No, no, you are not getting away.
Owww! Okay, okay! You win, you win! You always win!
Uh-huh. Right.
Uh, bud? Wha-? Yeah, sure, don't bother to wait for us.
Oh, my gods!
Yeah. You know, we're friends! No need to kill us.
No, not quite. It's more like a...Bright...Fury.
Yeah, yours is better, probably.
Vanished! Into thin air.
Uh-uh. Stubbier ears, no dorsal plates.
What-what's gotten into you? What is all this...slobbering and panting?
Trust me, relationships are nothing but pain and misery.
What did I just say? Am-am I not enough?
You know what? Just trace your Toothless card and make her white.
I never took you for a romantic. Like, ever!
Alright. Let's head back to the woods and see if we can find her.
Uhh... No, actually.
Look. We talked about it. We're not getting married.
Wait, Hiccy?
You're-you're really bad at pep talks.
Toothless!
Don't move a muscle.
Someone's here.
He managed to slip past our scouts and lay a trap in the woods.
Slow down, Gobber. Let's get a search team on the ground. Scouts in the air. Toothless and I will fly the coastline.
Well, he can't be that smart. He left his trap unmanned.
Yeah. We've dealt with his kind before.
Then we'll be waiting for him.
Alright. Alright, come on give me a clue here. Give me a clue, Dad.
Toothless!
What did you do to him?
He changed his mind.
I will never give him up.
You think you can come into my home, sit in my father's chair, and threaten my dragon?! This is Berk, and we have defended our way of life from far worse than you!
Astrid, look out!
Alright! Alright, everybody! Settle down, please!
Fishlegs, have you ever seen that species of dragon before?
Did you miss the part where we almost died? Have you seen my house? This is a new kind of enemy and I underestimated him. Now, that's on me. But I will not do that again.
Grimmel is just a sign of the times. Our enemies are getting smarter, more determined. We're not just overcrowded. We are exposed, and vulnerable. Short of full-blown war and risking everyone we love, I don't... I don't see a way of staying here any longer.
If we want to live in peace with our dragons, we need a better plan.
I'm saying we have to disappear. Off the map. Take the dragons to a place where no one will find them.
My father was obsessed with it when I was a boy. He made notes and maps in search of the ancestral home of all dragons, tucked away somewhere beyond the edge of the world. It may be the solution we need. We're dragon people. It's where we belong.
Look, I know this is our home. My father left me to protect it.
But Berk is more than this place. We are Berk! The people! The dragons! I say Berk is wherever we go.
Just keep flying until we reach the end of the world.
What're you picking up on, bud?
Woah! Hold up, Toothless!
Well, look who it is!
Aah! Hey. It's really nice to finally-
Not a word.
Alright! Looks like we're camping here for tonight.
Oh, okay. Hold on, gang. I-I said make camp...
...not, build a new village.
Granted this place is very nice, but it's not the Hidden World.
(sighs) Well, I guess this could work as a base in the meantime. It's defensible. Hidden. Alright! You can stay!
Until Toothless and I find the Hidden World.
Just, be careful.
Do you still think I'm crazy or...
Well, thanks for supporting me last night. It meant a lot.
Toothless, no, it's too early.
Oh, now you can draw!
And neither of us will be getting any sleep or finding the Hidden World until Toothless takes over.
Hey! What do you think of that? Yeah.
Well, until now he didn't have a reason to. Right, bud?
Well, he's my best bud. I want him to be happy. And besides it's just until he brings her back.
Alright, fire when ready!
Okay, Toothless.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes, I know. Shh, I know. Shhh.
Okay, I know.
Please, this is not helping.
Uh, he's fresh off his first date. Now he's love-crazed.
Yeah, but to do that, he'll need to fly without me. So, time to give this new and improved baby a shot.
Attaboy! Looking sharp, Toothless. So, what do you think, bud? Bring her home (impersonates Stoick) by sundown at the latest.
No, save it for your girlfriend! Go on, get out of here!
It's okay.
Yeah, okay, guys! Now I'm just getting sick! Okay. Ha. Ha. Ha.
This is supposed to be a temporary solution.
What if the tail broke? What if Grimmel found him? What if... he needs me?
How would I know? She never comes around. And when she does, she's always rushing off. I'm saying how-how do we know if she's right for us.
You know what I mean. She's so wild and skittish. I'm just gonna say it, I don't trust her.
I have a prosthetic leg!
Mom! Are you hurt? What happened out there?
If Grimmel is leading them here, we have to take him out of the mix.
By going there to capture him.
Why are you doing this?
But you have dragons of your own.
Take cover!
I led us right into his trap.
Where is Ruffnut?
O-Okay guys! Just keep your helmets on! Toothless and I will fly--
I never thought he'd stay away for good! I-I... Ah... Look, I'll figure it out. I just need more time.
Everybody, stay put! We will get Ruffnut back! Don't worry!
Where--where is she heading?
There's nothing but miles and miles of--
A great waterfall--
Look! (points at the edge of the cliff)
It really does exist.
Toothless.
We should go.
I-I'm sorry bud. I-I-I just--
I was thirsty.
Dad? Are you gonna get us a new mom?
It's okay, bud. You belong there, with her. We don't.
And that's alright.
We'll find a way to man--
Hey! (Toothless licks his face and he laughs.) She followed us back!
We might not have to say goodbye after all.
That's it.
Wai-wait... Grimmel LET you go?
Ruffnut! Focus. Were you followed?
(gasps) Toothless!
Toothless!
Toothless! Come back!
Not with her life on the line.
Toothless!
(Keeps pacing around and sees Astrid) Don't say it.
I shouldn't have dragged you out there. He wouldn't have flown me back. She wouldn't have followed.
Aah! I feel like the same screw up I was before I met Toothless.
(Stops walking and looks at Astrid) Are you just gonna stand there and agree with everything?
(shrugs) Probably something stupid.
Suit up, gang! We're gonna get them back.
No. You guys are the best I've got.
Hold on, Toothless!
Toothless!
Perfect timing!
Game faces!
I'm coming, Toothless!
I'm sorry, bud! For everything!
Now let's go get her!
How are we going to get him off her back without hurting her?
Uh, we've got problems.
We need a better plan!
And quick!
Uh, what... what are you doing?
Okay... okay.
See? I knew you'd come around.
Hey, good morning, bud.
Here you go.
Boy, you are full of surprises.
He's all yours.
You're right, bud. It's time. I was so busy fighting for a world that I wanted, I didn't think about what you needed.
You've looked after us for long enough. Time to look after yourselves.
Go on, bud. Lead them to the Hidden World. You'll be safe there. Safer than you could ever be with me. It's okay. (Places his head on Toothless' head.) I love you too. And I want you to be free. Our world doesn't deserve you... yet.
Go, Toothless. Go.
There were dragons when I was a boy. Oh, there were great grim sky dragons that nested on the cliff tops like gigantic scary birds. Little brown scuddly dragons that hunted down the mice and rats and well-organized packs. Preposterously huge sea dragons that were 20 times as big as the big blue whale. Some say they crawled back into the sea leaving not a bone or a fang to remember them. Others say they were nothing but folk tales to begin with. I'm okay with that. Hey. Hey there, bud. Remember me?
Oh! Ah! Oh-ho-ho. Hey, I'm glad to see you, too, bud.
How's the tail holding up? Could probably use some oil and little fine-tuning.
Ah! Come on!
Come. He won't hurt you. Hold your hands out. Like this. That's it.
Let him come to you.
Legend says that when the ground quakes or lava spews from the earth, it's the dragons letting us know they're still here, waiting for us to figure out how to get along. Yes, the world believes the dragons are gone, if they ever existed at all. But we Berkians... we know otherwise. And we'll guard the secret until the time comes when dragons can return in peace.
