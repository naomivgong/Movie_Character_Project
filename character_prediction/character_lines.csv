13163,m38,bottle rocket,L103675,u599,ANTHONY,What?,905
13164,m38,bottle rocket,L103674,u603,DIGNAN,I have an idea for that.,905
13165,m38,bottle rocket,L103673,u599,ANTHONY,We need a car.,905
13166,m38,bottle rocket,L103672,u603,DIGNAN,I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.,905
13167,m38,bottle rocket,L103671,u599,ANTHONY,Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --,905
13168,m38,bottle rocket,L103670,u603,DIGNAN,Would of been nice.,905
13169,m38,bottle rocket,L103669,u599,ANTHONY,I wish I'd been there.,905
13170,m38,bottle rocket,L103668,u603,DIGNAN,Can you hand me those french fries.,905
13171,m38,bottle rocket,L103667,u599,ANTHONY,I can't believe he just jumped you.,905
13172,m38,bottle rocket,L103643,u603,DIGNAN,OK.,905
13173,m38,bottle rocket,L103642,u599,ANTHONY,Why don't you come with us.,905
13174,m38,bottle rocket,L103641,u603,DIGNAN,No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.,905
13175,m38,bottle rocket,L103640,u599,ANTHONY,We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.,905
13176,m38,bottle rocket,L103636,u603,DIGNAN,Well the world is a little bit colder today.,905
13177,m38,bottle rocket,L103635,u599,ANTHONY,I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself Dignan.,905
13178,m38,bottle rocket,L103634,u603,DIGNAN,If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.,905
13179,m38,bottle rocket,L103633,u599,ANTHONY,If you say so.,905
13180,m38,bottle rocket,L103632,u603,DIGNAN,I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.,905
13181,m38,bottle rocket,L103631,u599,ANTHONY,Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.,905
13182,m38,bottle rocket,L103630,u603,DIGNAN,So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised that was just an act. You were just --,905
13183,m38,bottle rocket,L103629,u599,ANTHONY,Well I didn't do it did I?,905
13184,m38,bottle rocket,L103628,u603,DIGNAN,If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?,905
13185,m38,bottle rocket,L103627,u599,ANTHONY,He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.,905
13186,m38,bottle rocket,L103626,u603,DIGNAN,He told you and you let him do it.,905
13187,m38,bottle rocket,L103625,u599,ANTHONY,You were asleep.,905
13188,m38,bottle rocket,L103624,u603,DIGNAN,Where was I?,905
13189,m38,bottle rocket,L103623,u599,ANTHONY,This morning.,905
13190,m38,bottle rocket,L103622,u603,DIGNAN,When'd he tell you?,905
13191,m38,bottle rocket,L103618,u599,ANTHONY,That's a long time to be in jail.,905
13192,m38,bottle rocket,L103617,u603,DIGNAN,We said 48 hours.,905
13193,m38,bottle rocket,L103616,u599,ANTHONY,He went back for his brother.,905
13194,m38,bottle rocket,L103615,u603,DIGNAN,He took his stuff. He's gone.  I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character.,905
13195,m38,bottle rocket,L103614,u599,ANTHONY,Maybe he just went to the store.,905
13196,m38,bottle rocket,L103613,u603,DIGNAN,That coward. Son of a bitch.,905
13197,m38,bottle rocket,L103612,u603,DIGNAN,Right here.,905
13198,m38,bottle rocket,L103611,u599,ANTHONY,Where was it parked?,905
13199,m38,bottle rocket,L103610,u603,DIGNAN,He's gone. He stole the car.,905
13200,m38,bottle rocket,L103608,u603,DIGNAN,Yes... It's true.,905
13201,m38,bottle rocket,L103607,u599,ANTHONY,But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.,905
13202,m38,bottle rocket,L103606,u603,DIGNAN,They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.,905
13203,m38,bottle rocket,L103605,u599,ANTHONY,After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.,905
13204,m38,bottle rocket,L103604,u603,DIGNAN,Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.,905
13205,m38,bottle rocket,L103603,u599,ANTHONY,This was in fourth grade.,905
13206,m38,bottle rocket,L103602,u603,DIGNAN,See one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.,905
13207,m38,bottle rocket,L103594,u599,ANTHONY,Don't worry about it Bob.,905
13208,m38,bottle rocket,L103593,u603,DIGNAN,See now we've got a plan.,905
13209,m38,bottle rocket,L103589,u599,ANTHONY,Bob?,905
13210,m38,bottle rocket,L103588,u603,DIGNAN,Obviously. That's a given.,905
13211,m38,bottle rocket,L103587,u599,ANTHONY,As long as he gets out OK.,905
13212,m38,bottle rocket,L103586,u603,DIGNAN,Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.,905
13213,m38,bottle rocket,L103583,u599,ANTHONY,No no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.,905
13214,m38,bottle rocket,L103582,u603,DIGNAN,He needs to hire an attorney.,905
13215,m38,bottle rocket,L103577,u603,DIGNAN,No kidding.,905
13216,m38,bottle rocket,L103576,u599,ANTHONY,She's from Cuba.,905
13217,m38,bottle rocket,L103575,u599,ANTHONY,On the left.,905
13218,m38,bottle rocket,L103574,u603,DIGNAN,Which one was that?,905
13219,m38,bottle rocket,L103573,u599,ANTHONY,No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.,905
13220,m38,bottle rocket,L103572,u603,DIGNAN,They don't?,905
13221,m38,bottle rocket,L103571,u599,ANTHONY,No. I didn't. Dignan they don't speak English.,905
13222,m38,bottle rocket,L103570,u603,DIGNAN,Anthony we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?,905
13223,m38,bottle rocket,L103569,u599,ANTHONY,What. What's the matter?,905
13224,m38,bottle rocket,L103568,u603,DIGNAN,What the fuck is going on here?,905
13225,m38,bottle rocket,L103567,u599,ANTHONY,Sure.,905
13226,m38,bottle rocket,L103566,u603,DIGNAN,May I have a word with you please?,905
13227,m38,bottle rocket,L103565,u603,DIGNAN,Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.,905
13228,m38,bottle rocket,L103564,u599,ANTHONY,Inez this is --,905
13229,m38,bottle rocket,L103563,u603,DIGNAN,Hi.,905
13230,m38,bottle rocket,L103562,u599,ANTHONY,This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.,905
13231,m38,bottle rocket,L103560,u603,DIGNAN,No. We didn't.,905
13232,m38,bottle rocket,L103559,u599,ANTHONY,I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.,905
13233,m38,bottle rocket,L103477,u603,DIGNAN,Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?,905
13234,m38,bottle rocket,L103476,u599,ANTHONY,No Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.,905
13235,m38,bottle rocket,L103475,u603,DIGNAN,Then you're going to have to dye it Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.,905
13236,m38,bottle rocket,L103474,u599,ANTHONY,Dignan I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible all right?,905
13237,m38,bottle rocket,L103458,u603,DIGNAN,True.,905
13238,m38,bottle rocket,L103457,u599,ANTHONY,Yeah but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.,905
13239,m38,bottle rocket,L103456,u603,DIGNAN,Actually. If you knew the exact route you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.,905
13240,m38,bottle rocket,L103455,u599,ANTHONY,It's not a plan. It's just --,905
13241,m38,bottle rocket,L103454,u603,DIGNAN,Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.,905
13242,m38,bottle rocket,L103453,u599,ANTHONY,I know. But once you get inside you're home free.,905
13243,m38,bottle rocket,L103452,u603,DIGNAN,Armored trucks are very difficult to steal Anthony.,905
13244,m38,bottle rocket,L103451,u599,ANTHONY,It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.,905
13245,m38,bottle rocket,L103450,u603,DIGNAN,No I'm not saying her. I'm just saying I don't know.,905
13246,m38,bottle rocket,L103449,u599,ANTHONY,Look man. She didn't know anything about shirts.,905
13247,m38,bottle rocket,L103442,u599,ANTHONY,Bob?,905
13248,m38,bottle rocket,L103441,u603,DIGNAN,You owe me fifty bucks.,905
13249,m38,bottle rocket,L103440,u603,DIGNAN,On your marks...  Get set go.,905
13250,m38,bottle rocket,L103439,u599,ANTHONY,OK. Go ahead.,905
13251,m38,bottle rocket,L103438,u603,DIGNAN,I'll say it.,905
13252,m38,bottle rocket,L103437,u599,ANTHONY,I'll just say it.,905
13253,m38,bottle rocket,L103434,u603,DIGNAN,You were spoiled rotten.,905
13254,m38,bottle rocket,L103433,u599,ANTHONY,Don't call me spoiled Dignan.,905
13255,m38,bottle rocket,L103432,u603,DIGNAN,That's real cool Anthony. Yeah I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.,905
13256,m38,bottle rocket,L103431,u599,ANTHONY,You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.,905
13257,m38,bottle rocket,L103430,u603,DIGNAN,Really. OK Dad. But seriously Anthony. These are fast shoes.,905
13258,m38,bottle rocket,L103427,u603,DIGNAN,Well those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.,905
13259,m38,bottle rocket,L103426,u599,ANTHONY,They obviously weren't designed for racing.,905
13260,m38,bottle rocket,L103425,u603,DIGNAN,What about them?,905
13261,m38,bottle rocket,L103424,u599,ANTHONY,Look at the treads on those.,905
13262,m38,bottle rocket,L103423,u603,DIGNAN,Yes they are.,905
13263,m38,bottle rocket,L103422,u599,ANTHONY,Dignan those aren't running shoes.,905
13264,m38,bottle rocket,L103421,u603,DIGNAN,See if mine are in there.,905
13265,m38,bottle rocket,L103419,u603,DIGNAN,Anthony we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...,905
13266,m38,bottle rocket,L103418,u599,ANTHONY,I keep it for emergencies.,905
13267,m38,bottle rocket,L103417,u603,DIGNAN,Well then cut it in half.,905
13268,m38,bottle rocket,L103416,u599,ANTHONY,I don't want to use it.,905
13269,m38,bottle rocket,L103415,u603,DIGNAN,She's not going to notice Anthony.,905
13270,m38,bottle rocket,L103414,u599,ANTHONY,Because my mom gets the bill.,905
13271,m38,bottle rocket,L103413,u603,DIGNAN,Why not?,905
13272,m38,bottle rocket,L103412,u599,ANTHONY,I don't like to use that credit card Dignan.,905
13273,m38,bottle rocket,L103411,u603,DIGNAN,Can I get that credit card from you?,905
13274,m38,bottle rocket,L103343,u599,ANTHONY,Don't even say it man.,905
13275,m38,bottle rocket,L103342,u603,DIGNAN,I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans you're actually lucky you got --,905
13276,m38,bottle rocket,L103341,u599,ANTHONY,He was the driver Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.,905
13277,m38,bottle rocket,L103340,u603,DIGNAN,Anthony he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.,905
13278,m38,bottle rocket,L103339,u599,ANTHONY,What do you think?,905
13279,m38,bottle rocket,L103338,u603,DIGNAN,What's wrong with him?,905
13280,m38,bottle rocket,L103330,u603,DIGNAN,Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.,905
13281,m38,bottle rocket,L103329,u599,ANTHONY,Like he would find Dignan. One day.,905
13282,m38,bottle rocket,L103328,u603,DIGNAN,Yeah.,905
13283,m38,bottle rocket,L103327,u599,ANTHONY,Like he meant it.,905
13284,m38,bottle rocket,L103326,u603,DIGNAN,I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.,905
13285,m38,bottle rocket,L103323,u603,DIGNAN,Oh shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes I'm going to remember you.,905
13286,m38,bottle rocket,L103322,u599,ANTHONY,What about what that guy said?,905
13287,m38,bottle rocket,L103317,u603,DIGNAN,We got it. We got it.,905
13288,m38,bottle rocket,L103316,u599,ANTHONY,Holy shit.,905
13289,m38,bottle rocket,L103297,u603,DIGNAN,Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.,905
13290,m38,bottle rocket,L103296,u599,ANTHONY,Is that the manager?,905
13291,m38,bottle rocket,L103290,u603,DIGNAN,We know there's another stocker.,905
13292,m38,bottle rocket,L103289,u599,ANTHONY,There's another stocker right?,905
13293,m38,bottle rocket,L103288,u603,DIGNAN,Where's the other stocker?,905
13294,m38,bottle rocket,L103287,u599,ANTHONY,Where's the manager?,905
13295,m38,bottle rocket,L103249,u603,DIGNAN,You're right. You're right.,905
13296,m38,bottle rocket,L103248,u599,ANTHONY,Calm down. Take a deep breath.,905
13297,m38,bottle rocket,L103247,u599,ANTHONY,Dignan! Stop!,905
13298,m38,bottle rocket,L103246,u603,DIGNAN,You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!,905
13299,m38,bottle rocket,L103245,u599,ANTHONY,Dignan calm down.,905
13300,m38,bottle rocket,L103241,u599,ANTHONY,No Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.,905
13301,m38,bottle rocket,L103240,u603,DIGNAN,Anthony give me the fucking gun!,905
13302,m38,bottle rocket,L103234,u599,ANTHONY,Nothing. Go ahead.,905
13303,m38,bottle rocket,L103233,u603,DIGNAN,Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!,905
13304,m38,bottle rocket,L103227,u603,DIGNAN,That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However I will say --,905
13305,m38,bottle rocket,L103226,u599,ANTHONY,You think we're going to be chased?,905
13306,m38,bottle rocket,L103225,u603,DIGNAN,OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us as the case may be --,905
13307,m38,bottle rocket,L103214,u599,ANTHONY,Just turn right here.,905
13308,m38,bottle rocket,L103213,u603,DIGNAN,Loop around real fast.,905
13309,m38,bottle rocket,L103200,u603,DIGNAN,Yeah.,905
13310,m38,bottle rocket,L103199,u599,ANTHONY,Is it back in?,905
13311,m38,bottle rocket,L103190,u603,DIGNAN,Hang on a second.,905
13312,m38,bottle rocket,L103189,u599,ANTHONY,But he didn't say anything.,905
13313,m38,bottle rocket,L103156,u603,DIGNAN,That's not bad.,905
13314,m38,bottle rocket,L103155,u599,ANTHONY,Eight dollars.,905
13315,m38,bottle rocket,L103154,u603,DIGNAN,Holy shit. What'd I tell you?,905
13316,m38,bottle rocket,L103153,u599,ANTHONY,Five seven eight dollars.,905
13317,m38,bottle rocket,L103152,u603,DIGNAN,Yeah I heard that.,905
13318,m38,bottle rocket,L103151,u599,ANTHONY,It had an alarm.,905
13319,m38,bottle rocket,L103150,u603,DIGNAN,No just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.,905
13320,m38,bottle rocket,L103149,u599,ANTHONY,That sets it off.,905
13321,m38,bottle rocket,L103148,u603,DIGNAN,I don't think so. Just reach on in.,905
13322,m38,bottle rocket,L103147,u599,ANTHONY,Dignan it's got an alarm.,905
13323,m38,bottle rocket,L103146,u603,DIGNAN,I'm lookout.,905
13324,m38,bottle rocket,L103145,u599,ANTHONY,Yeah I saw it.,905
13325,m38,bottle rocket,L103144,u603,DIGNAN,Did you see that?,905
13326,m38,bottle rocket,L103143,u599,ANTHONY,That's not what I meant Dignan.,905
13327,m38,bottle rocket,L103142,u603,DIGNAN,You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.,905
13328,m38,bottle rocket,L103141,u599,ANTHONY,How was I ridiculing you?,905
13329,m38,bottle rocket,L103140,u603,DIGNAN,I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.,905
13330,m38,bottle rocket,L103139,u599,ANTHONY,Where are you going?,905
13331,m38,bottle rocket,L103137,u599,ANTHONY,Then you shouldn't of gone in there Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?,905
13332,m38,bottle rocket,L103136,u603,DIGNAN,Yeah but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.,905
13333,m38,bottle rocket,L103135,u599,ANTHONY,That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.,905
13334,m38,bottle rocket,L103134,u603,DIGNAN,Every valuable item in the house was on that list.,905
13335,m38,bottle rocket,L103128,u603,DIGNAN,I know about money Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.,905
13336,m38,bottle rocket,L103127,u599,ANTHONY,But Dignan do you really know that much about rare coins?,905
13337,m38,bottle rocket,L103126,u603,DIGNAN,Anthony we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.,905
13338,m38,bottle rocket,L103114,u603,DIGNAN,What do you think the cops have?,905
13339,m38,bottle rocket,L103113,u599,ANTHONY,It's got a V-8 Dignan.,905
13340,m38,bottle rocket,L103097,u603,DIGNAN,She's an attractive older woman.,905
13341,m38,bottle rocket,L103096,u599,ANTHONY,She's really kind of hot.,905
13342,m38,bottle rocket,L103092,u603,DIGNAN,See your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --,905
13343,m38,bottle rocket,L103091,u599,ANTHONY,Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.,905
13344,m38,bottle rocket,L103090,u599,ANTHONY,Who knows? That's why I filed it down.,905
13345,m38,bottle rocket,L103089,u603,DIGNAN,Would they do that?,905
13346,m38,bottle rocket,L103088,u599,ANTHONY,That's true. But what if they change the locks?,905
13347,m38,bottle rocket,L103087,u603,DIGNAN,Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.,905
13348,m38,bottle rocket,L103086,u599,ANTHONY,Did you see what I meant about the window?,905
13349,m38,bottle rocket,L103085,u599,ANTHONY,No. This is he.,905
13350,m38,bottle rocket,L103084,u603,DIGNAN,This is he?,905
13351,m38,bottle rocket,L103083,u599,ANTHONY,He says. This is he.,905
13352,m38,bottle rocket,L103082,u603,DIGNAN,What does Starsky say?,905
13353,m38,bottle rocket,L103081,u599,ANTHONY,The point is the killer always goes May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.,905
13354,m38,bottle rocket,L103080,u603,DIGNAN,See that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.,905
13355,m38,bottle rocket,L103079,u599,ANTHONY,As part of his plan. I don't know why.,905
13356,m38,bottle rocket,L103078,u603,DIGNAN,Why?,905
13357,m38,bottle rocket,L103077,u599,ANTHONY,No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.,905
13358,m38,bottle rocket,L103076,u603,DIGNAN,I think you might of dreamed this one Anthony.,905
13359,m38,bottle rocket,L103075,u599,ANTHONY,He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.,905
13360,m38,bottle rocket,L103074,u603,DIGNAN,Plus where's Huggie Bear?,905
13361,m38,bottle rocket,L103073,u599,ANTHONY,Dignan it's --,905
13362,m38,bottle rocket,L103072,u603,DIGNAN,OK. That's wrong.,905
13363,m38,bottle rocket,L103071,u599,ANTHONY,Right. The blond guy.,905
13364,m38,bottle rocket,L103070,u603,DIGNAN,Making Hutch David Soul?,905
13365,m38,bottle rocket,L103069,u599,ANTHONY,Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.,905
13366,m38,bottle rocket,L103068,u603,DIGNAN,What color hair does he have?,905
13368,m38,bottle rocket,L104044,u599,ANTHONY,Why'd you want to help us?,905
13370,m38,bottle rocket,L104042,u599,ANTHONY,Can I ask you something Mr. Henry?,905
13373,m38,bottle rocket,L104039,u599,ANTHONY,Yeah.,905

13384,m38,bottle rocket,L104004,u599,ANTHONY,Yeah. I mean I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go Woah. Man.,905
13386,m38,bottle rocket,L104002,u599,ANTHONY,I don't want to die.,905
13388,m38,bottle rocket,L104000,u599,ANTHONY,Me?,905
13390,m38,bottle rocket,L103986,u599,ANTHONY,That sounds like Dignan.,905
13392,m38,bottle rocket,L103984,u599,ANTHONY,How'd he do?,905
13394,m38,bottle rocket,L103982,u599,ANTHONY,Did Dignan take the test?,905
13395,m38,bottle rocket,L103981,u599,ANTHONY,It feels good.,905
13398,m38,bottle rocket,L103978,u599,ANTHONY,That was a test?,905
13400,m38,bottle rocket,L103976,u599,ANTHONY,What do you mean?,905
13403,m38,bottle rocket,L103972,u599,ANTHONY,And you're wrong if you think I'd turn my back on a friend.,905
13405,m38,bottle rocket,L103969,u599,ANTHONY,I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --,905

13409,m38,bottle rocket,L103965,u599,ANTHONY,I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --,905

13450,m38,bottle rocket,L103879,u601,BOB,It was stupid.,905

13452,m38,bottle rocket,L103760,u601,BOB,Jesus Christ! No.,905
13453,m38,bottle rocket,L103759,u599,ANTHONY,Was Future Man adopted?,905

13458,m38,bottle rocket,L103754,u601,BOB,Yeah but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.,905
13459,m38,bottle rocket,L103753,u599,ANTHONY,I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.,905
13460,m38,bottle rocket,L103748,u599,ANTHONY,Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.,905

13462,m38,bottle rocket,L103746,u599,ANTHONY,Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.,905
13463,m38,bottle rocket,L103745,u601,BOB,Sixty days?,905
13464,m38,bottle rocket,L103744,u599,ANTHONY,At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.,905
13465,m38,bottle rocket,L103739,u599,ANTHONY,I don't like that word prank Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.,905
13466,m38,bottle rocket,L103738,u601,BOB,That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.,905
13467,m38,bottle rocket,L103737,u599,ANTHONY,It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.,905
13468,m38,bottle rocket,L103736,u599,ANTHONY,Well I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.,905
13469,m38,bottle rocket,L103735,u601,BOB,I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.,905
13470,m38,bottle rocket,L103734,u599,ANTHONY,No I don't mind.,905
13471,m38,bottle rocket,L103733,u601,BOB,You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.,905

13476,m38,bottle rocket,L103728,u599,ANTHONY,Why not?,905
13477,m38,bottle rocket,L103727,u601,BOB,I'm not playing any more golf.,905

13483,m38,bottle rocket,L103581,u601,BOB,I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.,905
13484,m38,bottle rocket,L103580,u599,ANTHONY,How long are they going to hold him?,905
13485,m38,bottle rocket,L103468,u599,ANTHONY,He looked too shaken-up.,905
13486,m38,bottle rocket,L103467,u601,BOB,You think he got my license plates?,905
13487,m38,bottle rocket,L103429,u599,ANTHONY,OK Dad.,905

13509,m38,bottle rocket,L103172,u599,ANTHONY,Could you grow cinnamon?,905
13510,m38,bottle rocket,L103166,u601,BOB,But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.,905
13511,m38,bottle rocket,L103165,u599,ANTHONY,Hector woudn't do anything.,905

23369,m72,ghost world,L237449,u1108,SEYMOUR,It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.,944
23371,m72,ghost world,L237447,u1108,SEYMOUR,I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this but I uh...,944

23417,m72,ghost world,L237044,u1094,ENID,I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?,944
23419,m72,ghost world,L237042,u1094,ENID,It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden or something...,944

23454,m72,ghost world,L237256,u1094,ENID,I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...,944
23456,m72,ghost world,L237254,u1094,ENID,Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...,944
23458,m72,ghost world,L237252,u1094,ENID,Why do you have that stupid poster?,944
23460,m72,ghost world,L237249,u1094,ENID,It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God I practically love you Josh!,944

23493,m72,ghost world,L236536,u1094,ENID,This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad fake 50's diners.,944
23495,m72,ghost world,L236527,u1094,ENID,It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.,944

23512,m72,ghost world,L237557,u1094,ENID,You're lucky then you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.,944
23513,m72,ghost world,L237556,u1106,REBECCA,Oh hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!,944
23514,m72,ghost world,L237555,u1094,ENID,Hi.,944
23515,m72,ghost world,L237506,u1106,REBECCA,Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!,944
23516,m72,ghost world,L237505,u1094,ENID,I dunno...,944
23517,m72,ghost world,L237504,u1106,REBECCA,What time?,944
23518,m72,ghost world,L237503,u1094,ENID,I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.,944
23519,m72,ghost world,L237502,u1106,REBECCA,That's all you're bringing?,944
23520,m72,ghost world,L237501,u1094,ENID,There.,944
23521,m72,ghost world,L237500,u1106,REBECCA,So where's all your stuff?,944
23522,m72,ghost world,L237499,u1094,ENID,It's fine.,944
23523,m72,ghost world,L237498,u1106,REBECCA,So whaddya think?,944
23524,m72,ghost world,L237471,u1094,ENID,I'll get a job tomorrow I promise. If I don't you can totally tell me to fuck off.,944
23525,m72,ghost world,L237470,u1106,REBECCA,But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.,944
23526,m72,ghost world,L237469,u1094,ENID,Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.,944
23527,m72,ghost world,L237468,u1106,REBECCA,I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.,944
23528,m72,ghost world,L237467,u1094,ENID,Please let me come with you. Please please please...,944
23529,m72,ghost world,L237466,u1106,REBECCA,I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.,944
23530,m72,ghost world,L237465,u1094,ENID,I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.,944
23531,m72,ghost world,L237464,u1094,ENID,I need to talk to you.,944
23532,m72,ghost world,L237463,u1106,REBECCA,Hello?,944
23533,m72,ghost world,L237355,u1106,REBECCA,FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!,944
23534,m72,ghost world,L237354,u1094,ENID,You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!,944
23535,m72,ghost world,L237353,u1106,REBECCA,You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!,944
23536,m72,ghost world,L237352,u1094,ENID,Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.,944
23537,m72,ghost world,L237351,u1106,REBECCA,There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!,944
23538,m72,ghost world,L237349,u1106,REBECCA,Oh yeah I can tell you really love it!,944
23539,m72,ghost world,L237347,u1106,REBECCA,What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?,944
23540,m72,ghost world,L237346,u1094,ENID,Great...,944
23541,m72,ghost world,L237345,u1106,REBECCA,Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...,944
23542,m72,ghost world,L237344,u1106,REBECCA,I don't know! God don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.,944
23543,m72,ghost world,L237343,u1094,ENID,When was this?,944
23544,m72,ghost world,L237342,u1106,REBECCA,Nothing.,944
23545,m72,ghost world,L237341,u1094,ENID,Why? What did he say?,944
23546,m72,ghost world,L237340,u1106,REBECCA,He came into work.,944
23547,m72,ghost world,L237339,u1094,ENID,What? When did you see Josh?!,944
23548,m72,ghost world,L237338,u1106,REBECCA,Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...,944
23549,m72,ghost world,L237337,u1094,ENID,I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.,944
23550,m72,ghost world,L237336,u1106,REBECCA,It's a totally normal average neighborhood!,944
23551,m72,ghost world,L237335,u1094,ENID,Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...,944
23552,m72,ghost world,L237228,u1106,REBECCA,Yeah well you said you were busy... look I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow.,944
23553,m72,ghost world,L237227,u1094,ENID,I don't believe you.,944
23554,m72,ghost world,L237226,u1106,REBECCA,Just some people from work...,944
23555,m72,ghost world,L237225,u1094,ENID,What are you talking about? Who?,944
23556,m72,ghost world,L237224,u1106,REBECCA,Actually I'm just about to go out with some friends...,944
23557,m72,ghost world,L237223,u1094,ENID,So should I come over?,944
23558,m72,ghost world,L237222,u1106,REBECCA,How repulsive!,944
23559,m72,ghost world,L237221,u1094,ENID,I can't believe it - he actually scored!,944
23560,m72,ghost world,L237220,u1106,REBECCA,What happened to Seymour?,944
23561,m72,ghost world,L237219,u1094,ENID,Do you still want to do something tonight?,944
23562,m72,ghost world,L237218,u1106,REBECCA,Hello?,944
23563,m72,ghost world,L237193,u1106,REBECCA,God I'm so sick of Seymour.,944
23564,m72,ghost world,L237192,u1094,ENID,Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls so I can hear how bad it went.,944
23565,m72,ghost world,L237191,u1106,REBECCA,That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.,944
23566,m72,ghost world,L237190,u1094,ENID,What thing?,944
23567,m72,ghost world,L237189,u1106,REBECCA,Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?,944
23568,m72,ghost world,L237188,u1094,ENID,You're insane.,944
23569,m72,ghost world,L237187,u1106,REBECCA,You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.,944
23570,m72,ghost world,L237186,u1094,ENID,I can't imagine spending money on towels.,944
23571,m72,ghost world,L237185,u1106,REBECCA,Don't you want nice stuff?,944
23572,m72,ghost world,L237184,u1094,ENID,Why do you care about this kind of stuff?,944
23573,m72,ghost world,L237183,u1106,REBECCA,I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?,944
23574,m72,ghost world,L237182,u1094,ENID,I can't afford stuff like this right now.,944
23575,m72,ghost world,L237181,u1106,REBECCA,Look we have to get these...,944
23576,m72,ghost world,L237180,u1106,REBECCA,No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.,944
23577,m72,ghost world,L237179,u1094,ENID,Yeah but maybe one of us should at least try...,944
23578,m72,ghost world,L237178,u1106,REBECCA,I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...,944
23579,m72,ghost world,L237177,u1094,ENID,I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...,944
23580,m72,ghost world,L237176,u1106,REBECCA,God you're really obsessed...,944
23581,m72,ghost world,L237175,u1094,ENID,No really...,944
23582,m72,ghost world,L237174,u1106,REBECCA,Go ahead...,944
23583,m72,ghost world,L237173,u1094,ENID,I think one of us should fuck Josh...,944
23584,m72,ghost world,L237110,u1094,ENID,Yeah I guess... call me...,944
23585,m72,ghost world,L237109,u1106,REBECCA,Well are we still going shopping tomorrow?,944
23586,m72,ghost world,L237108,u1094,ENID,I can't it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...,944
23587,m72,ghost world,L237107,u1106,REBECCA,Do you want to do something tonight?,944
23588,m72,ghost world,L237106,u1094,ENID,Yeah thanks.,944
23589,m72,ghost world,L237105,u1106,REBECCA,If it makes you feel any better I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.,944
23590,m72,ghost world,L237104,u1094,ENID,Don't worry.,944
23591,m72,ghost world,L237103,u1106,REBECCA,Now are you going to get a regular job?,944
23592,m72,ghost world,L237089,u1094,ENID,Oh yeah right like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.,944
23593,m72,ghost world,L237088,u1106,REBECCA,What was that all about? I thought everything must go!,944
23594,m72,ghost world,L237083,u1106,REBECCA,Oh my god I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...,944
23595,m72,ghost world,L237082,u1094,ENID,Fuck it. Everything must go!,944
23596,m72,ghost world,L237081,u1106,REBECCA,This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.,944
23597,m72,ghost world,L237079,u1094,ENID,I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry I'm going to get another job... and anyway I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...,944
23598,m72,ghost world,L237078,u1106,REBECCA,What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!,944
23599,m72,ghost world,L237055,u1094,ENID,We were such desperate sluts back then.,944
23600,m72,ghost world,L237054,u1106,REBECCA,I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.,944
23601,m72,ghost world,L237053,u1094,ENID,That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...,944
23602,m72,ghost world,L237052,u1106,REBECCA,Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!,944
23603,m72,ghost world,L237051,u1094,ENID,Wasn't it like eighth grade?,944
23604,m72,ghost world,L237050,u1106,REBECCA,Anyway now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?,944
23605,m72,ghost world,L237049,u1094,ENID,I dunno but next week is my last class...,944
23606,m72,ghost world,L237048,u1106,REBECCA,When are you finally going to get your diploma?,944
23607,m72,ghost world,L237047,u1094,ENID,Yeah maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...,944
23608,m72,ghost world,L237046,u1106,REBECCA,Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God I wish that was my job...,944
23609,m72,ghost world,L236950,u1106,REBECCA,Get away from me!,944
23610,m72,ghost world,L236949,u1094,ENID,...maybe we should be lesbos...,944
23611,m72,ghost world,L236948,u1106,REBECCA,Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?,944
23612,m72,ghost world,L236947,u1094,ENID,That's not true I just hate all these obnoxious extroverted pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.,944
23613,m72,ghost world,L236946,u1106,REBECCA,Face it you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!,944
23614,m72,ghost world,L236945,u1094,ENID,Yeah right... Believe me at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!,944
23615,m72,ghost world,L236944,u1106,REBECCA,You're just jealous.,944
23616,m72,ghost world,L236933,u1094,ENID,He's like the biggest idiot of all time!,944
23617,m72,ghost world,L236932,u1106,REBECCA,He gives me a total boner!,944
23618,m72,ghost world,L236931,u1094,ENID,Which one?,944
23619,m72,ghost world,L236930,u1106,REBECCA,You're gross.  See that guy?,944
23620,m72,ghost world,L236929,u1094,ENID,Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.,944
23621,m72,ghost world,L236928,u1106,REBECCA,You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.,944
23622,m72,ghost world,L236927,u1094,ENID,I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.,944
23623,m72,ghost world,L236926,u1106,REBECCA,...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.,944
23624,m72,ghost world,L236906,u1106,REBECCA,God I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.,944
23625,m72,ghost world,L236905,u1094,ENID,Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.,944
23626,m72,ghost world,L236904,u1106,REBECCA,Like what?,944
23627,m72,ghost world,L236903,u1094,ENID,I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have all these projects that take up all my time.,944
23628,m72,ghost world,L236902,u1106,REBECCA,Yeah well...  So when are you going to get your job?,944
23629,m72,ghost world,L236901,u1094,ENID,But those are our people...,944
23630,m72,ghost world,L236900,u1106,REBECCA,No it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.,944
23631,m72,ghost world,L236899,u1094,ENID,That rules!,944
23632,m72,ghost world,L236898,u1106,REBECCA,He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair he's just totally lazy!,944
23633,m72,ghost world,L236897,u1094,ENID,At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...,944
23634,m72,ghost world,L236896,u1106,REBECCA,I don't know... Some people are okay but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.,944
23635,m72,ghost world,L236895,u1094,ENID,God how can you stand all these assholes?,944
23636,m72,ghost world,L236891,u1106,REBECCA,He does that every single day.,944
23637,m72,ghost world,L236890,u1094,ENID,That guy is totally amazing.,944
23638,m72,ghost world,L236886,u1106,REBECCA,You cunt!,944
23639,m72,ghost world,L236885,u1094,ENID,Just now... I went with Seymour.,944
23640,m72,ghost world,L236884,u1106,REBECCA,No way... when?,944
23641,m72,ghost world,L236883,u1094,ENID,Anthony's II!,944
23642,m72,ghost world,L236882,u1106,REBECCA,Where?,944
23643,m72,ghost world,L236881,u1094,ENID,You won't believe it! Guess!,944
23644,m72,ghost world,L236880,u1106,REBECCA,Where did you get that?,944
23645,m72,ghost world,L236879,u1094,ENID,Give me all your money bitch!,944
23646,m72,ghost world,L236797,u1106,REBECCA,Wait...,944
23647,m72,ghost world,L236796,u1094,ENID,I'll be right back I'm gonna go get a beer.,944
23648,m72,ghost world,L236784,u1094,ENID,Aw c'mon this is a fun party.,944
23649,m72,ghost world,L236783,u1106,REBECCA,I totally totally hate you.,944
23650,m72,ghost world,L236777,u1094,ENID,If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys do you promise you'll go?,944
23651,m72,ghost world,L236776,u1106,REBECCA,I don't believe you.,944
23652,m72,ghost world,L236775,u1094,ENID,It's a surprise.,944
23653,m72,ghost world,L236774,u1106,REBECCA,What? Where?!,944
23654,m72,ghost world,L236773,u1094,ENID,I know a party we could go to...,944
23655,m72,ghost world,L236772,u1106,REBECCA,We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.,944
23656,m72,ghost world,L236771,u1094,ENID,Let's get out of here this place makes me sick.,944
23657,m72,ghost world,L236768,u1094,ENID,Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.,944
23658,m72,ghost world,L236767,u1106,REBECCA,How about this?,944
23659,m72,ghost world,L236766,u1106,REBECCA,God aren't you tired of Seymour yet?,944
23660,m72,ghost world,L236765,u1094,ENID,This morning at Seymour's garage sale.,944
23661,m72,ghost world,L236764,u1106,REBECCA,Ew ... when did you get that?,944
23662,m72,ghost world,L236763,u1094,ENID,Hey you have to see my new good luck charm.,944
23663,m72,ghost world,L236762,u1106,REBECCA,How about this one?,944
23664,m72,ghost world,L236721,u1094,ENID,Everybody's too stupid!,944
23665,m72,ghost world,L236720,u1106,REBECCA,I didn't get it either.,944
23666,m72,ghost world,L236719,u1094,ENID,It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!,944
23667,m72,ghost world,L236718,u1106,REBECCA,What was that all about?,944
23668,m72,ghost world,L236700,u1094,ENID,It'll only take a second.,944
23669,m72,ghost world,L236699,u1106,REBECCA,Why are we going here? I hate this place.,944
23670,m72,ghost world,L236696,u1106,REBECCA,Should we leave a note?,944
23671,m72,ghost world,L236695,u1094,ENID,Yeah he's beyond human stuff like that.,944
23672,m72,ghost world,L236694,u1106,REBECCA,I'll bet he never jerks off...,944

23675,m72,ghost world,L236683,u1106,REBECCA,Why don't you ask him.,944
23676,m72,ghost world,L236682,u1094,ENID,I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --,944
23677,m72,ghost world,L236681,u1106,REBECCA,Waiting for the bus that never comes...,944
23678,m72,ghost world,L236680,u1094,ENID,As always.,944
23679,m72,ghost world,L236679,u1106,REBECCA,There he is...,944

23683,m72,ghost world,L236673,u1106,REBECCA,It's always closed...,944

23687,m72,ghost world,L236669,u1094,ENID,What? How long have you been standing there?,944
23688,m72,ghost world,L236664,u1094,ENID,Okay okay I promise... Jesus you're out of your mind.,944

23690,m72,ghost world,L236662,u1094,ENID,You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.,944
23691,m72,ghost world,L236661,u1106,REBECCA,That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.,944
23692,m72,ghost world,L236660,u1094,ENID,What are you talking about?,944
23693,m72,ghost world,L236659,u1106,REBECCA,I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...,944

23697,m72,ghost world,L236645,u1094,ENID,Forget it I can't explain it...,944
23698,m72,ghost world,L236644,u1106,REBECCA,Not really...,944
23699,m72,ghost world,L236643,u1094,ENID,Yeah but... you know what I mean.,944
23700,m72,ghost world,L236641,u1094,ENID,I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...,944
23701,m72,ghost world,L236640,u1106,REBECCA,He should totally just kill himself... Hey here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...,944
23702,m72,ghost world,L236639,u1094,ENID,Oh yeah...,944
23703,m72,ghost world,L236637,u1094,ENID,It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?,944
23704,m72,ghost world,L236636,u1106,REBECCA,He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God these apartments are super expensive...,944
23705,m72,ghost world,L236634,u1106,REBECCA,That was truly pathetic.,944
23706,m72,ghost world,L236602,u1106,REBECCA,Ew it's like some gross rat...,944
23707,m72,ghost world,L236601,u1094,ENID,I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.,944
23708,m72,ghost world,L236600,u1106,REBECCA,Gross!,944

23710,m72,ghost world,L236598,u1094,ENID,Come on it's too late now...,944
23711,m72,ghost world,L236597,u1106,REBECCA,What should we do? What if he recognizes us?,944
23712,m72,ghost world,L236594,u1094,ENID,Bingo!,944
23713,m72,ghost world,L236593,u1106,REBECCA,The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God The National Psoriasis Foundation!,944
23714,m72,ghost world,L236589,u1094,ENID,I'm afraid if I see him I'll start feeling really bad again.,944
23715,m72,ghost world,L236588,u1106,REBECCA,He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.,944
23716,m72,ghost world,L236587,u1094,ENID,This is way too creepy.,944
23717,m72,ghost world,L236584,u1094,ENID,This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.,944
23718,m72,ghost world,L236583,u1106,REBECCA,I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?,944
23719,m72,ghost world,L236582,u1094,ENID,He doesn't even look that bummed out really.,944
23720,m72,ghost world,L236575,u1106,REBECCA,We should follow him home.,944
23721,m72,ghost world,L236574,u1094,ENID,He's insane!,944
23722,m72,ghost world,L236573,u1094,ENID,Totally! Look!,944

23725,m72,ghost world,L236565,u1106,REBECCA,Do you think he knows?,944
23726,m72,ghost world,L236561,u1094,ENID,He's still just sitting there. God this is totally unbearable!,944
23727,m72,ghost world,L236560,u1106,REBECCA,What's he doing now?,944

23730,m72,ghost world,L236556,u1106,REBECCA,I can't believe it!,944
23731,m72,ghost world,L236555,u1094,ENID,It's obviously him!,944
23732,m72,ghost world,L236550,u1106,REBECCA,What exactly is a cardigan anyway?,944
23733,m72,ghost world,L236549,u1094,ENID,Is he wearing a green cardigan?,944

23741,m72,ghost world,L236530,u1094,ENID,God I think Josh is too mature for us.,944
23742,m72,ghost world,L236501,u1094,ENID,Shh it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.,944
23743,m72,ghost world,L236500,u1106,REBECCA,What does it stand for?,944
23744,m72,ghost world,L236498,u1106,REBECCA,You're better at it.,944

23763,m72,ghost world,L236471,u1094,ENID,I've been looking all over for this.,944
23764,m72,ghost world,L236470,u1106,REBECCA,You lent it to me in like tenth grade.,944
23765,m72,ghost world,L236469,u1094,ENID,Hey - why do you have this?,944
23766,m72,ghost world,L236466,u1094,ENID,I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.,944
23767,m72,ghost world,L236465,u1106,REBECCA,What is this?,944
23768,m72,ghost world,L236464,u1094,ENID,Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.,944

23774,m72,ghost world,L236453,u1094,ENID,I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.,944
23775,m72,ghost world,L236452,u1106,REBECCA,God that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.,944

23785,m72,ghost world,L236427,u1106,REBECCA,God it's so totally pathetic.,944
23786,m72,ghost world,L236425,u1094,ENID,Hey look at this...,944
23787,m72,ghost world,L236424,u1106,REBECCA,Okay okay!,944

23789,m72,ghost world,L236422,u1106,REBECCA,Or maybe not.,944
23790,m72,ghost world,L236421,u1094,ENID,Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.,944
23791,m72,ghost world,L236420,u1106,REBECCA,That lets us off the hook.,944
23792,m72,ghost world,L236419,u1094,ENID,You know sacrifice virgins and stuff...,944
23793,m72,ghost world,L236418,u1106,REBECCA,What do you do if you're a satanist anyway?,944

23798,m72,ghost world,L236401,u1094,ENID,I know it hasn't really hit me yet.,944
23799,m72,ghost world,L236400,u1106,REBECCA,God it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.,944

23820,m72,ghost world,L236355,u1094,ENID,Just think we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.,944
23821,m72,ghost world,L236354,u1094,ENID,This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...,944

23828,m72,ghost world,L236346,u1106,REBECCA,It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...,944
23829,m72,ghost world,L236345,u1094,ENID,I know I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.,944
23830,m72,ghost world,L236344,u1106,REBECCA,I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.,944

23858,m72,ghost world,L237314,u1094,ENID,Where did you get those pants?,944
23860,m72,ghost world,L236733,u1094,ENID,It's kind of falling apart.,944
23862,m72,ghost world,L236731,u1094,ENID,I thought it wasn't for sale.,944
23865,m72,ghost world,L236614,u1094,ENID,Who does?,944
23867,m72,ghost world,L236612,u1094,ENID,Do you have any other old records besides these?,944
23868,m72,ghost world,L236611,u1094,ENID,That's okay...,944
23870,m72,ghost world,L236607,u1094,ENID,How much is this?,944
23872,m72,ghost world,L236605,u1094,ENID,A what?,944
23874,m72,ghost world,L236716,u1094,ENID,Go die asshole!,944
23876,m72,ghost world,L236714,u1094,ENID,That tape sucked by the way!,944
23878,m72,ghost world,L236711,u1094,ENID,That's not even --,944
23879,m72,ghost world,L236709,u1094,ENID,I know it's over asshole I --,944
23881,m72,ghost world,L236707,u1094,ENID,Tell me what?,944
23884,m72,ghost world,L236688,u1094,ENID,I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.,944
23886,m72,ghost world,L236686,u1094,ENID,...are you waiting for a bus?,944
23888,m72,ghost world,L236684,u1094,ENID,Hi... what's your name?,944
23890,m72,ghost world,L236413,u1094,ENID,Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later I'm broke.,944
23891,m72,ghost world,L236409,u1094,ENID,Fuck you you stupid redneck hick!,944
23893,m72,ghost world,L236407,u1094,ENID,I did too!,944
23895,m72,ghost world,L236405,u1094,ENID,Did you bring that tape?,944
23897,m72,ghost world,L236403,u1094,ENID,You're late asshole.,944
23900,m72,ghost world,L237098,u1094,ENID,Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.,944
23902,m72,ghost world,L237096,u1094,ENID,I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.,944
23904,m72,ghost world,L237094,u1094,ENID,Five hundred.,944
23906,m72,ghost world,L237092,u1094,ENID,That's five hundred dollars.,944
23907,m72,ghost world,L237462,u1094,ENID,I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!,944
23908,m72,ghost world,L237461,u1108,SEYMOUR,I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...,944
23909,m72,ghost world,L237439,u1094,ENID,Shhh... I really need to get some sleep.,944
23910,m72,ghost world,L237438,u1108,SEYMOUR,But I...,944
23911,m72,ghost world,L237437,u1094,ENID,I was just thinking out loud...  I mean you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...,944
23912,m72,ghost world,L237436,u1108,SEYMOUR,You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?,944
23913,m72,ghost world,L237435,u1094,ENID,Yeah well... me neither...,944
23914,m72,ghost world,L237434,u1108,SEYMOUR,I-I never expected anything like this to happen...,944
23915,m72,ghost world,L237433,u1094,ENID,No... forget it...,944
23916,m72,ghost world,L237432,u1108,SEYMOUR,I will if you want to.,944
23917,m72,ghost world,L237431,u1094,ENID,What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...,944
23918,m72,ghost world,L237430,u1108,SEYMOUR,...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?,944
23919,m72,ghost world,L237429,u1094,ENID,God Dana's going to kill you!,944
23920,m72,ghost world,L237428,u1094,ENID,What's the matter with you Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life!,944
23921,m72,ghost world,L237427,u1108,SEYMOUR,I-I-I...,944
23922,m72,ghost world,L237426,u1094,ENID,What do you want?,944
23923,m72,ghost world,L237425,u1108,SEYMOUR,What do you want?,944
23924,m72,ghost world,L237424,u1094,ENID,I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?,944
23925,m72,ghost world,L237423,u1108,SEYMOUR,I dunno I...,944
23926,m72,ghost world,L237422,u1094,ENID,Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?,944
23927,m72,ghost world,L237421,u1108,SEYMOUR,So where would we go?,944
23928,m72,ghost world,L237420,u1094,ENID,I'll drive then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!,944
23929,m72,ghost world,L237419,u1108,SEYMOUR,I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.,944
23930,m72,ghost world,L237418,u1094,ENID,You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!,944
23931,m72,ghost world,L237417,u1108,SEYMOUR,Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.,944
23932,m72,ghost world,L237416,u1094,ENID,It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.,944
23933,m72,ghost world,L237415,u1108,SEYMOUR,I guess I probably used to when I was your age.,944
23934,m72,ghost world,L237414,u1094,ENID,I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?,944
23935,m72,ghost world,L237413,u1108,SEYMOUR,What?,944
23936,m72,ghost world,L237412,u1094,ENID,You know what my number one fantasy used to be?,944
23937,m72,ghost world,L237411,u1108,SEYMOUR,Yeah well I like you too...,944
23938,m72,ghost world,L237410,u1094,ENID,Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter twisted fucked-up guy Seymour that's why I like you.,944
23939,m72,ghost world,L237409,u1108,SEYMOUR,What about Joe?,944
23940,m72,ghost world,L237408,u1094,ENID,...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.,944
23941,m72,ghost world,L237407,u1108,SEYMOUR,Yeah sure. Of course.,944
23942,m72,ghost world,L237406,u1094,ENID,I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean you like me don't you? We're good friends right?,944
23943,m72,ghost world,L237405,u1108,SEYMOUR,I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?,944
23944,m72,ghost world,L237404,u1094,ENID,Yeah but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.,944
23945,m72,ghost world,L237403,u1108,SEYMOUR,You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.,944
23946,m72,ghost world,L237402,u1094,ENID,How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date you never asked me out?,944
23947,m72,ghost world,L237401,u1108,SEYMOUR,I hate sports.,944
23948,m72,ghost world,L237400,u1094,ENID,At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!,944
23949,m72,ghost world,L237399,u1108,SEYMOUR,I'm just being realistic.,944
23950,m72,ghost world,L237398,u1094,ENID,What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.,944
23951,m72,ghost world,L237397,u1108,SEYMOUR,If you expect the worst you're never disappointed.,944
23952,m72,ghost world,L237395,u1108,SEYMOUR,God she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!,944
23953,m72,ghost world,L237394,u1094,ENID,Jesus how can you stand her?,944
23954,m72,ghost world,L237392,u1094,ENID,Where did you get this?,944
23955,m72,ghost world,L237391,u1108,SEYMOUR,I could never move - I've got too much stuff.,944
23956,m72,ghost world,L237390,u1094,ENID,You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.,944
23957,m72,ghost world,L237389,u1094,ENID,FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.,944
23958,m72,ghost world,L237388,u1108,SEYMOUR,That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --,944
23959,m72,ghost world,L237387,u1094,ENID,What about this?,944
23960,m72,ghost world,L237386,u1108,SEYMOUR,Uh... I think there's some root beer...,944
23961,m72,ghost world,L237385,u1094,ENID,Do you have anything to drink?,944
23962,m72,ghost world,L237384,u1108,SEYMOUR,What's the matter?,944
23963,m72,ghost world,L237383,u1094,ENID,Look I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.,944
23964,m72,ghost world,L237382,u1108,SEYMOUR,Uh... sure... come in.,944
23965,m72,ghost world,L237381,u1094,ENID,Can you at least let me in?,944
23966,m72,ghost world,L237380,u1108,SEYMOUR,What's up?,944
23967,m72,ghost world,L237379,u1094,ENID,I had to see you.,944
23968,m72,ghost world,L237378,u1108,SEYMOUR,What are you doing here?,944
23969,m72,ghost world,L237334,u1094,ENID,Nothing. Don't worry I won't bother you any more.,944
23970,m72,ghost world,L237333,u1108,SEYMOUR,...What do you mean?,944
23971,m72,ghost world,L237332,u1094,ENID,I don't think you understand how I really feel about you Seymour.,944
23972,m72,ghost world,L237331,u1108,SEYMOUR,I don't know... I'm sorry but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...,944
23973,m72,ghost world,L237330,u1094,ENID,In whatever way you think I mean.,944
23974,m72,ghost world,L237329,u1108,SEYMOUR,In what way do you mean?,944
23975,m72,ghost world,L237328,u1094,ENID,So do you like me Seymour?,944
23976,m72,ghost world,L237327,u1108,SEYMOUR,No of course not.,944
23977,m72,ghost world,L237326,u1094,ENID,Does that mean you don't like me?,944
23978,m72,ghost world,L237325,u1108,SEYMOUR,I... I don't think so.,944
23979,m72,ghost world,L237324,u1094,ENID,You must have done something to make her think you like me.,944
23980,m72,ghost world,L237323,u1108,SEYMOUR,Just someone so young...,944
23981,m72,ghost world,L237321,u1108,SEYMOUR,No no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...,944
23982,m72,ghost world,L237320,u1094,ENID,What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?,944
23983,m72,ghost world,L237319,u1108,SEYMOUR,No of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --,944
23984,m72,ghost world,L237318,u1094,ENID,So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?,944
23985,m72,ghost world,L237317,u1108,SEYMOUR,Well you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...,944
23986,m72,ghost world,L237316,u1094,ENID,And you like them?,944
23987,m72,ghost world,L237315,u1108,SEYMOUR,Oh uh... they were a present from Dana.,944
23988,m72,ghost world,L237312,u1108,SEYMOUR,It's just that well you know Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...,944
23989,m72,ghost world,L237311,u1094,ENID,Well when can we do something?,944
23990,m72,ghost world,L237310,u1108,SEYMOUR,I... I wish I could Enid but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --,944
23991,m72,ghost world,L237309,u1094,ENID,Well forget the art show... let's do something else.,944
23992,m72,ghost world,L237308,u1108,SEYMOUR,...I better not...,944
23993,m72,ghost world,L237307,u1094,ENID,Of course you should. C'mon I'm already a million hours late.,944
23994,m72,ghost world,L237306,u1108,SEYMOUR,I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...,944
23995,m72,ghost world,L237305,u1094,ENID,I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...,944
23996,m72,ghost world,L237282,u1094,ENID,Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...,944
23997,m72,ghost world,L237281,u1108,SEYMOUR,...so... is he your boyfriend now?,944
23998,m72,ghost world,L237280,u1094,ENID,I dunno... okay I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...,944
23999,m72,ghost world,L237279,u1108,SEYMOUR,I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --,944
24000,m72,ghost world,L237278,u1094,ENID,Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?,944
24001,m72,ghost world,L237277,u1108,SEYMOUR,No... no it's just that I should get going in a few minutes and --,944
24002,m72,ghost world,L237276,u1094,ENID,What are you trying to get rid of me?,944
24003,m72,ghost world,L237275,u1108,SEYMOUR,We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --,944
24004,m72,ghost world,L237274,u1094,ENID,Sounds good...,944
24005,m72,ghost world,L237273,u1108,SEYMOUR,Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying anyway... actually we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...,944
24006,m72,ghost world,L237272,u1094,ENID,So what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?,944
24007,m72,ghost world,L237271,u1108,SEYMOUR,Oh... pretty well surprisingly... you know...,944
24008,m72,ghost world,L237270,u1094,ENID,Yeah I'll bet! So how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?,944
24009,m72,ghost world,L237269,u1108,SEYMOUR,I know I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...,944
24010,m72,ghost world,L237268,u1094,ENID,No actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?,944
24011,m72,ghost world,L237267,u1108,SEYMOUR,Really?,944
24012,m72,ghost world,L237266,u1094,ENID,Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...,944
24013,m72,ghost world,L237265,u1108,SEYMOUR,YAAA!,944
24014,m72,ghost world,L237264,u1094,ENID,Boo!,944
24015,m72,ghost world,L237217,u1108,SEYMOUR,Jesus Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye!,944
24016,m72,ghost world,L237216,u1094,ENID,What are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?,944
24017,m72,ghost world,L237215,u1108,SEYMOUR,Yeah so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...,944
24018,m72,ghost world,L237214,u1094,ENID,What? You're kidding me...,944
24019,m72,ghost world,L237213,u1108,SEYMOUR,Actually it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...,944
24020,m72,ghost world,L237212,u1094,ENID,So what happened?,944
24021,m72,ghost world,L237211,u1108,SEYMOUR,Oh hi...,944
24022,m72,ghost world,L237210,u1094,ENID,Hi it's me...,944
24023,m72,ghost world,L237209,u1108,SEYMOUR,Uh... hello?,944
24024,m72,ghost world,L237148,u1094,ENID,Well uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!,944
24025,m72,ghost world,L237147,u1108,SEYMOUR,How can you be so sure?,944
24026,m72,ghost world,L237146,u1094,ENID,Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!,944
24027,m72,ghost world,L237145,u1108,SEYMOUR,Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.,944
24028,m72,ghost world,L237144,u1094,ENID,That didn't sound like a joke to me... what did you write a personal ad or something?,944
24029,m72,ghost world,L237143,u1108,SEYMOUR,It's just somebody's idea of a joke...,944
24030,m72,ghost world,L237142,u1094,ENID,Wow!  What was that all about?,944
24031,m72,ghost world,L237139,u1108,SEYMOUR,Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...,944
24032,m72,ghost world,L237138,u1094,ENID,Aren't you going to get that?,944
24033,m72,ghost world,L237137,u1108,SEYMOUR,Who knows?,944
24034,m72,ghost world,L237136,u1094,ENID,I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?,944
24035,m72,ghost world,L237135,u1108,SEYMOUR,I won't even dignify that with a response.,944
24036,m72,ghost world,L237134,u1094,ENID,Never mind it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?,944
24037,m72,ghost world,L237133,u1108,SEYMOUR,Why?,944
24038,m72,ghost world,L237132,u1094,ENID,Oh wait you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.,944
24039,m72,ghost world,L237131,u1108,SEYMOUR,Oh yeah?,944
24040,m72,ghost world,L237130,u1094,ENID,Actually I've got a total crush on this one guy right now but it's a really fucked-up situation...,944
24041,m72,ghost world,L237129,u1108,SEYMOUR,Then again that's easy for me to say since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.,944
24042,m72,ghost world,L237128,u1094,ENID,I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.,944
24043,m72,ghost world,L237127,u1108,SEYMOUR,I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.,944
24044,m72,ghost world,L237126,u1094,ENID,Never...,944
24045,m72,ghost world,L237125,u1108,SEYMOUR,Really?,944
24046,m72,ghost world,L237124,u1094,ENID,I mean I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!,944
24047,m72,ghost world,L237123,u1108,SEYMOUR,That's the spirit!,944
24048,m72,ghost world,L237122,u1094,ENID,Yeah well you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...,944
24049,m72,ghost world,L237121,u1108,SEYMOUR,Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.,944
24050,m72,ghost world,L237120,u1094,ENID,What like a girdle?,944
24051,m72,ghost world,L237119,u1108,SEYMOUR,Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...,944
24052,m72,ghost world,L237118,u1094,ENID,What is that?,944
24053,m72,ghost world,L237117,u1108,SEYMOUR,It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...,944
24054,m72,ghost world,L237116,u1094,ENID,Are you okay?,944
24055,m72,ghost world,L237115,u1108,SEYMOUR,Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...,944
24056,m72,ghost world,L237114,u1094,ENID,No Doofus... blow it out!,944
24057,m72,ghost world,L237113,u1108,SEYMOUR,Oh... uh thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...,944
24058,m72,ghost world,L237112,u1094,ENID,You can open your eyes now.,944
24059,m72,ghost world,L237030,u1094,ENID,Don't you trust me Seymour?,944
24060,m72,ghost world,L237029,u1108,SEYMOUR,I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --,944
24061,m72,ghost world,L237028,u1094,ENID,I promise I'll take good care of it.,944
24062,m72,ghost world,L237027,u1108,SEYMOUR,What? Why?,944
24063,m72,ghost world,L237026,u1094,ENID,Hey can I borrow this?,944
24064,m72,ghost world,L237025,u1108,SEYMOUR,No in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other but they know how to hide it better or something...,944
24065,m72,ghost world,L237024,u1094,ENID,So I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?,944
24066,m72,ghost world,L237023,u1108,SEYMOUR,I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?,944
24067,m72,ghost world,L237022,u1094,ENID,Yeah but still...,944
24068,m72,ghost world,L237021,u1108,SEYMOUR,Hey I get good benefits a good early retirement plan nobody ever bothers me...,944
24069,m72,ghost world,L237020,u1094,ENID,Jesus I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.,944
24070,m72,ghost world,L237019,u1108,SEYMOUR,Nothing so glamorous... actually I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.,944
24071,m72,ghost world,L237018,u1094,ENID,What are you a fry cook or something?,944
24072,m72,ghost world,L237017,u1108,SEYMOUR,For nineteen years...,944
24073,m72,ghost world,L237016,u1094,ENID,You work at Cook's Chicken?,944
24074,m72,ghost world,L237015,u1108,SEYMOUR,Actually I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...,944
24075,m72,ghost world,L237009,u1108,SEYMOUR,Yeah right I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?,944
24076,m72,ghost world,L237008,u1094,ENID,What are you a klansman or something?,944
24077,m72,ghost world,L237007,u1108,SEYMOUR,What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.,944
24078,m72,ghost world,L237006,u1094,ENID,What the fuck Seymour?! What is this?,944
24079,m72,ghost world,L237005,u1094,ENID,I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...,944
24080,m72,ghost world,L237004,u1108,SEYMOUR,If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?,944
24081,m72,ghost world,L237003,u1094,ENID,Wow this is so cool...,944
24082,m72,ghost world,L237001,u1094,ENID,It doesn't matter I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.,944
24083,m72,ghost world,L237000,u1108,SEYMOUR,I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --,944
24084,m72,ghost world,L236999,u1108,SEYMOUR,Hooray for me.,944
24085,m72,ghost world,L236998,u1094,ENID,I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...,944
24086,m72,ghost world,L236997,u1108,SEYMOUR,But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...,944
24087,m72,ghost world,L236996,u1094,ENID,Yeah well I can't relate to humanity either but I don't think it's totally hopeless...,944
24088,m72,ghost world,L236995,u1108,SEYMOUR,Yeah well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.,944
24089,m72,ghost world,L236994,u1094,ENID,It's not hopeless...,944
24090,m72,ghost world,L236993,u1108,SEYMOUR,Look I really appreciate your help Enid but let's face it this is hopeless.,944
24091,m72,ghost world,L236992,u1094,ENID,We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot that's all.,944
24092,m72,ghost world,L236991,u1108,SEYMOUR,Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.,944
24093,m72,ghost world,L236990,u1108,SEYMOUR,Jesus...,944
24094,m72,ghost world,L236989,u1094,ENID,I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.,944
24095,m72,ghost world,L236988,u1108,SEYMOUR,What did you tell that girl?,944
24096,m72,ghost world,L236981,u1094,ENID,Just wait here.,944
24097,m72,ghost world,L236980,u1108,SEYMOUR,Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...,944
24098,m72,ghost world,L236979,u1094,ENID,Well offer her a seat! You want me to do it?,944
24099,m72,ghost world,L236978,u1108,SEYMOUR,Yes that would certainly do...,944
24100,m72,ghost world,L236975,u1094,ENID,Jesus Seymour.,944
24101,m72,ghost world,L236974,u1108,SEYMOUR,What are we in slow motion here?! What are ya hypnotized? Have some more kids why don't you?... For Christ's sake would you move!?,944
24102,m72,ghost world,L236973,u1108,SEYMOUR,I'm not holding my breath in that department.,944
24103,m72,ghost world,L236972,u1094,ENID,This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.,944
24104,m72,ghost world,L236971,u1108,SEYMOUR,I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!,944
24105,m72,ghost world,L236970,u1094,ENID,So why did you bring this along?,944
24106,m72,ghost world,L236969,u1108,SEYMOUR,That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...,944
24107,m72,ghost world,L236968,u1094,ENID,Relax Seymour relax...,944
24108,m72,ghost world,L236874,u1094,ENID,C'mon Seymour please?,944
24109,m72,ghost world,L236873,u1108,SEYMOUR,Uh I don't have much money with me right now.,944
24110,m72,ghost world,L236868,u1108,SEYMOUR,These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.,944
24111,m72,ghost world,L236864,u1094,ENID,OH MY GOD!,944
24112,m72,ghost world,L236863,u1108,SEYMOUR,Shh!,944
24113,m72,ghost world,L236862,u1094,ENID,Wow! Look at all these creeps!,944
24114,m72,ghost world,L236861,u1094,ENID,Fine I'll go by myself then...,944
24115,m72,ghost world,L236860,u1108,SEYMOUR,I really don't think it's a good idea.,944
24116,m72,ghost world,L236859,u1094,ENID,PLEASE? We have to!,944
24117,m72,ghost world,L236858,u1108,SEYMOUR,I don't think so...,944
24118,m72,ghost world,L236857,u1094,ENID,We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!,944
24119,m72,ghost world,L236856,u1108,SEYMOUR,I - I'd really rather not...,944
24120,m72,ghost world,L236855,u1094,ENID,Please Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?,944
24121,m72,ghost world,L236854,u1108,SEYMOUR,Yeah sure... very funny....,944
24122,m72,ghost world,L236853,u1094,ENID,Oh my god! We have to go in here!,944
24123,m72,ghost world,L236852,u1108,SEYMOUR,Well are --,944
24124,m72,ghost world,L236851,u1094,ENID,Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.,944
24125,m72,ghost world,L236850,u1108,SEYMOUR,So is that your boyfriend?,944
24126,m72,ghost world,L236841,u1108,SEYMOUR,Well let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz Blues and Ragtime music at the top of the list then probably...,944
24127,m72,ghost world,L236840,u1094,ENID,Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests in order of importance.,944
24128,m72,ghost world,L236839,u1108,SEYMOUR,Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?,944
24129,m72,ghost world,L236838,u1094,ENID,We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.,944
24130,m72,ghost world,L236835,u1108,SEYMOUR,I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...,944
24131,m72,ghost world,L236834,u1094,ENID,Every guy has a type!,944
24132,m72,ghost world,L236832,u1094,ENID,C'mon Seymour I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?,944
24133,m72,ghost world,L236831,u1108,SEYMOUR,Jesus!,944
24134,m72,ghost world,L236830,u1094,ENID,Okay what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?,944
24135,m72,ghost world,L236829,u1108,SEYMOUR,I really didn't get a good look at her.,944
24136,m72,ghost world,L236828,u1094,ENID,But putting that aside for now would you go out with her?,944
24137,m72,ghost world,L236827,u1108,SEYMOUR,I don't know what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...,944
24138,m72,ghost world,L236826,u1094,ENID,What about her? Would you go out with her?,944
24139,m72,ghost world,L236825,u1108,SEYMOUR,Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --,944
24140,m72,ghost world,L236824,u1094,ENID,Mark my words by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!,944
24141,m72,ghost world,L236823,u1108,SEYMOUR,I appreciate the offer but you really don't --,944
24142,m72,ghost world,L236822,u1094,ENID,I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!,944
24143,m72,ghost world,L236821,u1108,SEYMOUR,Yeah well...,944
24144,m72,ghost world,L236820,u1094,ENID,I'm totally serious!,944
24145,m72,ghost world,L236819,u1108,SEYMOUR,Good luck...,944
24146,m72,ghost world,L236818,u1094,ENID,No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...,944
24147,m72,ghost world,L236817,u1108,SEYMOUR,Oh right...,944
24148,m72,ghost world,L236816,u1094,ENID,I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!,944
24149,m72,ghost world,L236815,u1108,SEYMOUR,Yeah right... If I'm so cool why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.,944
24150,m72,ghost world,L236814,u1094,ENID,No you're not! You're a cool guy Seymour.,944
24151,m72,ghost world,L236813,u1108,SEYMOUR,You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.,944
24152,m72,ghost world,L236812,u1094,ENID,Oh come on! What are you talking about?,944
24153,m72,ghost world,L236811,u1108,SEYMOUR,Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy believe me.,944
24154,m72,ghost world,L236810,u1094,ENID,God look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!,944
24155,m72,ghost world,L236809,u1108,SEYMOUR,I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...,944
24156,m72,ghost world,L236808,u1094,ENID,Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!,944
24157,m72,ghost world,L236807,u1108,SEYMOUR,Yeah well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...,944
24158,m72,ghost world,L236806,u1094,ENID,Really? Can I see it?,944
24159,m72,ghost world,L236805,u1108,SEYMOUR,Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.,944
24160,m72,ghost world,L236804,u1094,ENID,You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?,944
24161,m72,ghost world,L236803,u1108,SEYMOUR,I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.,944
24162,m72,ghost world,L236802,u1094,ENID,What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?,944
24163,m72,ghost world,L236738,u1094,ENID,Hey I was only kidding!,944
24164,m72,ghost world,L236737,u1108,SEYMOUR,NO!!!,944
24165,m72,ghost world,L236736,u1094,ENID,Oops! I dropped it!,944
24166,m72,ghost world,L236729,u1108,SEYMOUR,Watch my stuff.,944
24167,m72,ghost world,L236728,u1094,ENID,Yeah sure I guess...,944
24168,m72,ghost world,L236727,u1108,SEYMOUR,Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...,944
24169,m72,ghost world,L236726,u1094,ENID,Wow!,944
24170,m72,ghost world,L236725,u1108,SEYMOUR,The Skip James record? Yeah that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.,944
24171,m72,ghost world,L236723,u1108,SEYMOUR,So you really liked it? Yeah there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie huh?,944
24172,m72,ghost world,L236722,u1094,ENID,Yeah it took a while before I got a chance to play it but when I heard that song it was like --,944
24173,m72,ghost world,L236631,u1094,ENID,Okay.,944
24174,m72,ghost world,L236630,u1108,SEYMOUR,A dollar seventy-five.,944
24175,m72,ghost world,L236629,u1094,ENID,How much is it?,944
24176,m72,ghost world,L236628,u1094,ENID,Wow!,944
24177,m72,ghost world,L236627,u1108,SEYMOUR,This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.,944
24178,m72,ghost world,L236626,u1108,SEYMOUR,Nah it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.,944
24179,m72,ghost world,L236625,u1094,ENID,Is this one any good?,944
24180,m72,ghost world,L236624,u1108,SEYMOUR,Well there's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff.,944
24181,m72,ghost world,L236623,u1094,ENID,Sure I guess.,944
24182,m72,ghost world,L236622,u1108,SEYMOUR,There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?,944
24183,m72,ghost world,L236621,u1094,ENID,Sure!... Wait maybe not 78s but I can play regular records...,944
24184,m72,ghost world,L236620,u1108,SEYMOUR,Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?,944
24185,m72,ghost world,L236618,u1094,ENID,You know like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.,944
24186,m72,ghost world,L236617,u1108,SEYMOUR,Indian records?,944
24187,m72,ghost world,L236616,u1094,ENID,Do you have any old Indian records?,944
24195,m72,ghost world,L237492,u1108,SEYMOUR,Yeah well... thanks for cheering me up.,944
24198,m72,ghost world,L237489,u1108,SEYMOUR,Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back.,944
24200,m72,ghost world,L237487,u1108,SEYMOUR,Yeah I'm really really happy. Really having a good time.,944
24202,m72,ghost world,L237570,u1106,REBECCA,Call me sometime.,944
24204,m72,ghost world,L237568,u1106,REBECCA,Did you remember to pay the phone bill?,944
24205,m72,ghost world,L236563,u1106,REBECCA,I wish I could see him.,944
24208,m72,ghost world,L236528,u1106,REBECCA,So Josh if this guy freaks out will you protect us?,944
24210,m72,ghost world,L236524,u1106,REBECCA,Please Josh?,944
24224,m72,ghost world,L237535,u1108,SEYMOUR,What fake blind date? What are you talking about?,944
24225,m72,ghost world,L237534,u1106,REBECCA,Didn't she ever tell you about that? God she really is pathological...,944

24240,m72,ghost world,L237519,u1108,SEYMOUR,I don't know.,944

24244,m72,ghost world,L237515,u1108,SEYMOUR,Why would she be hiding from me?,944
24245,m72,ghost world,L237514,u1106,REBECCA,Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.,944

24261,m72,ghost world,L237542,u1108,SEYMOUR,I have to admit things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.,944
37238,m105,jackie brown,L313916,u1593,JACKIE,I'm sorry I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.,1197

37252,m105,jackie brown,L313096,u1595,MAX,I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.,1197
37254,m105,jackie brown,L313094,u1595,MAX,I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided I'll never write you again. You understand?,1197
37256,m105,jackie brown,L313092,u1595,MAX,But then you told her you were home.,1197
37258,m105,jackie brown,L313090,u1595,MAX,But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.,1197
37260,m105,jackie brown,L313088,u1595,MAX,Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid but she's mad at you because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral,1197
37261,m105,jackie brown,L312938,u1598,ORDELL,But the only way to help you was to do that so I did it.  Okay how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat.,1197
37263,m105,jackie brown,L312936,u1598,ORDELL,Answer the question nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?,1197
37264,m105,jackie brown,L312935,u1598,ORDELL,You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?,1197
37266,m105,jackie brown,L312933,u1598,ORDELL,Well if you owe me git your ass in the trunk.,1197
37268,m105,jackie brown,L312931,u1598,ORDELL,Well my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful peanuthead niggas outta jail but I do it --,1197
37270,m105,jackie brown,L312929,u1598,ORDELL,I can't believe you do me this way.,1197
37272,m105,jackie brown,L312927,u1598,ORDELL,You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.,1197

37281,m105,jackie brown,L312917,u1598,ORDELL,I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you backup.,1197
37283,m105,jackie brown,L312915,u1598,ORDELL,Well it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?,1197
37285,m105,jackie brown,L312913,u1598,ORDELL,Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look I gotta problem. I need help and you can help me.,1197

37291,m105,jackie brown,L312907,u1598,ORDELL,Look I hate to be the kinda nigga does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.,1197
37293,m105,jackie brown,L312905,u1598,ORDELL,Naw man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.,1197

37418,m105,jackie brown,L314131,u1593,JACKIE,I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.,1197
37419,m105,jackie brown,L314130,u1595,MAX,Why?,1197
37420,m105,jackie brown,L314129,u1593,JACKIE,Tell him I want to give him his money.,1197

37426,m105,jackie brown,L314123,u1593,JACKIE,It never was so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look Ray more or less believes my story and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.,1197
37427,m105,jackie brown,L314122,u1595,MAX,It's not that simple.,1197
37428,m105,jackie brown,L314121,u1593,JACKIE,That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine who are they gonna believe?,1197
37429,m105,jackie brown,L314120,u1595,MAX,Everybody wants him he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in he's gonna name you as an accessory.,1197
37430,m105,jackie brown,L314119,u1593,JACKIE,Ray wants him.,1197
37431,m105,jackie brown,L314118,u1595,MAX,On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.,1197
37432,m105,jackie brown,L314117,u1593,JACKIE,He's liable to shoot you.,1197
37433,m105,jackie brown,L314116,u1595,MAX,People talk to Winston. He's street same as them they trust him. They get busted they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.,1197
37434,m105,jackie brown,L314115,u1593,JACKIE,How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?,1197
37435,m105,jackie brown,L314114,u1595,MAX,All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.,1197
37436,m105,jackie brown,L314113,u1593,JACKIE,How'd you find out?,1197
37437,m105,jackie brown,L313851,u1593,JACKIE,Well a suit. There's one I had my eye on.,1197

37439,m105,jackie brown,L313849,u1593,JACKIE,That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.,1197
37440,m105,jackie brown,L313848,u1595,MAX,You're gonna have surveillance all over you.,1197
37441,m105,jackie brown,L313847,u1593,JACKIE,Yeah but I'm not in jail and I tried.,1197
37442,m105,jackie brown,L313846,u1595,MAX,Then you're out and you get nothing.,1197
37443,m105,jackie brown,L313845,u1593,JACKIE,Not really. If he finds it I say Mr. Walker put the money in and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.,1197
37444,m105,jackie brown,L313844,u1595,MAX,You're takin' a helluva chance kid.,1197
37445,m105,jackie brown,L313843,u1593,JACKIE,He won't -- I mean he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.,1197
37446,m105,jackie brown,L313842,u1595,MAX,What if he checks it?,1197
37447,m105,jackie brown,L313841,u1593,JACKIE,In the bag underneath.,1197
37448,m105,jackie brown,L313840,u1595,MAX,Where's the rest of it?,1197
37449,m105,jackie brown,L313839,u1593,JACKIE,Well you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.,1197
37450,m105,jackie brown,L313838,u1595,MAX,But you still have to show him the money at the airport.,1197
37451,m105,jackie brown,L313837,u1593,JACKIE,Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.,1197
37452,m105,jackie brown,L313836,u1595,MAX,It'll be more than that.,1197
37453,m105,jackie brown,L313834,u1593,JACKIE,All he needed was a reasonable explanation.,1197
37454,m105,jackie brown,L313833,u1595,MAX,You know a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.,1197
37455,m105,jackie brown,L313832,u1593,JACKIE,Oh yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.,1197
37456,m105,jackie brown,L313831,u1595,MAX,Do you think they bought it?,1197
37457,m105,jackie brown,L313830,u1593,JACKIE,I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.,1197
37458,m105,jackie brown,L313677,u1593,JACKIE,That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this Max I know I can. But I can't do it without you.,1197
37459,m105,jackie brown,L313676,u1595,MAX,You're rationalizing.,1197
37460,m105,jackie brown,L313654,u1593,JACKIE,It may be evidence once they get their hands on it but right now it's only money.,1197
37461,m105,jackie brown,L313653,u1595,MAX,The feds. It's evidence.,1197
37462,m105,jackie brown,L313627,u1593,JACKIE,What if I've figured a way?,1197
37463,m105,jackie brown,L313626,u1595,MAX,Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...,1197
37464,m105,jackie brown,L313625,u1595,MAX,I believe I said I'd be tempted.,1197
37465,m105,jackie brown,L313624,u1593,JACKIE,If you had a chance unemployed now to walk off with a half-million dollars would you take it?,1197
37466,m105,jackie brown,L313623,u1595,MAX,Which one?,1197
37467,m105,jackie brown,L313622,u1593,JACKIE,I'm not sure you answered my question.,1197
37468,m105,jackie brown,L313621,u1595,MAX,More or less.,1197
37469,m105,jackie brown,L313620,u1593,JACKIE,And is that it?,1197
37470,m105,jackie brown,L313618,u1593,JACKIE,Did you do it that night?,1197
37471,m105,jackie brown,L313617,u1595,MAX,That's my job.,1197
37472,m105,jackie brown,L313616,u1593,JACKIE,You do that?,1197
37473,m105,jackie brown,L313615,u1595,MAX,Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated cuff him take 'em to County.,1197
37474,m105,jackie brown,L313614,u1593,JACKIE,What do you do when he comes home?,1197
37475,m105,jackie brown,L313613,u1595,MAX,And went to this guy's house in El Monte and I waited for him.,1197
37476,m105,jackie brown,L313612,u1595,MAX,Got another gun and a stun gun...,1197
37477,m105,jackie brown,L313609,u1595,MAX,Uh-huh.,1197
37478,m105,jackie brown,L313608,u1593,JACKIE,Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?,1197
37479,m105,jackie brown,L313607,u1595,MAX,Yeah that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house so I sneak in wait for him to come home.,1197
37480,m105,jackie brown,L313606,u1593,JACKIE,The day you got me out of jail?,1197
37481,m105,jackie brown,L313605,u1595,MAX,Hi I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.,1197
37482,m105,jackie brown,L313604,u1595,MAX,It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.,1197
37483,m105,jackie brown,L313603,u1593,JACKIE,When did you decide?,1197
37484,m105,jackie brown,L313602,u1595,MAX,A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.,1197
37485,m105,jackie brown,L313601,u1593,JACKIE,Why?,1197
37486,m105,jackie brown,L313600,u1595,MAX,I have to stand behind all my active bonds but I'm not writing any new ones.,1197
37487,m105,jackie brown,L313599,u1595,MAX,Okay sure. I might be tempted. Especially now since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.,1197
37488,m105,jackie brown,L313598,u1593,JACKIE,You're avoiding the question.,1197
37489,m105,jackie brown,L313597,u1595,MAX,A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.,1197
37490,m105,jackie brown,L313596,u1593,JACKIE,You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.,1197
37491,m105,jackie brown,L313595,u1595,MAX,If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money would I take it?,1197
37492,m105,jackie brown,L313594,u1593,JACKIE,No I mean you right now. Not it you were somebody else.,1197
37493,m105,jackie brown,L313593,u1595,MAX,What? If I was in Nicolet's place?,1197
37494,m105,jackie brown,L313592,u1593,JACKIE,What about you Max?,1197
37495,m105,jackie brown,L313591,u1595,MAX,No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.,1197
37496,m105,jackie brown,L313590,u1593,JACKIE,He tries to act cool.,1197
37497,m105,jackie brown,L313589,u1595,MAX,Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?,1197
37498,m105,jackie brown,L313588,u1593,JACKIE,He weren't bullshittin' either 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.,1197
37499,m105,jackie brown,L313587,u1595,MAX,You know some interesting people.,1197
37500,m105,jackie brown,L313586,u1593,JACKIE,Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.,1197
37501,m105,jackie brown,L313585,u1595,MAX,Has he hinted around?,1197
37502,m105,jackie brown,L313584,u1593,JACKIE,You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.,1197
37503,m105,jackie brown,L313583,u1595,MAX,I see.,1197
37504,m105,jackie brown,L313582,u1593,JACKIE,He's setting me up to make a proposition.,1197
37505,m105,jackie brown,L313581,u1595,MAX,I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?,1197
37506,m105,jackie brown,L313580,u1593,JACKIE,Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.,1197
37507,m105,jackie brown,L313579,u1595,MAX,You think he's got a thing for you?,1197
37508,m105,jackie brown,L313578,u1593,JACKIE,I know I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.,1197
37509,m105,jackie brown,L313577,u1595,MAX,I called you last night.,1197
37510,m105,jackie brown,L313576,u1593,JACKIE,Yeah we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.,1197
37511,m105,jackie brown,L313575,u1595,MAX,He was here?,1197
37512,m105,jackie brown,L313574,u1593,JACKIE,I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.,1197
37513,m105,jackie brown,L313573,u1595,MAX,Will Ordell go for that?,1197
37514,m105,jackie brown,L313572,u1595,MAX,Sit down leave the bag under the table?,1197
37515,m105,jackie brown,L313571,u1593,JACKIE,Right around here in the food court.,1197
37516,m105,jackie brown,L313570,u1595,MAX,Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.,1197
37517,m105,jackie brown,L313569,u1593,JACKIE,He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved I want to stage it. You know make it look more intriguing like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.,1197
37518,m105,jackie brown,L313568,u1595,MAX,You don't actually do it that way?,1197
37519,m105,jackie brown,L313567,u1593,JACKIE,Yea but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.,1197
37520,m105,jackie brown,L313566,u1595,MAX,Bring the money in and they follow it?,1197
37521,m105,jackie brown,L313565,u1593,JACKIE,They seem to like the idea.,1197
37522,m105,jackie brown,L313564,u1595,MAX,You talk them into it?,1197
37523,m105,jackie brown,L313563,u1593,JACKIE,I go back to work tomorrow.,1197
37524,m105,jackie brown,L313562,u1595,MAX,What're you a bag lady?,1197
37525,m105,jackie brown,L313561,u1595,MAX,I don't care.,1197
37526,m105,jackie brown,L313560,u1593,JACKIE,How old's Annette?,1197
37527,m105,jackie brown,L313559,u1595,MAX,I'm old enough to be her father.,1197
37528,m105,jackie brown,L313558,u1593,JACKIE,Why?,1197
37529,m105,jackie brown,L313557,u1595,MAX,She's adorable. But I had to end it.,1197
37530,m105,jackie brown,L313555,u1595,MAX,Sandra Bullock. You know her?,1197
37531,m105,jackie brown,L313554,u1593,JACKIE,Who was your girl before Annette?,1197
37532,m105,jackie brown,L313552,u1595,MAX,For now. These relationships never last too long.,1197
37533,m105,jackie brown,L313551,u1593,JACKIE,And Annette's it for you?,1197
37534,m105,jackie brown,L313550,u1595,MAX,Well I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men but as or myself and a few of my friends that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.,1197
37535,m105,jackie brown,L313549,u1593,JACKIE,Does it happen to all men?,1197
37536,m105,jackie brown,L313546,u1595,MAX,No...  ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.,1197
37537,m105,jackie brown,L313545,u1593,JACKIE,Oh are you? Does she know that?,1197
37538,m105,jackie brown,L313544,u1595,MAX,Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.,1197
37539,m105,jackie brown,L313543,u1593,JACKIE,How was it?,1197
37540,m105,jackie brown,L313541,u1593,JACKIE,What'd ya see?,1197
37541,m105,jackie brown,L313540,u1595,MAX,Catching a movie.,1197
37542,m105,jackie brown,L313539,u1593,JACKIE,I know ignoring me. What're you up to?,1197
37543,m105,jackie brown,L313538,u1595,MAX,I walked right past you.,1197
37544,m105,jackie brown,L313537,u1593,JACKIE,Surprise.,1197
37545,m105,jackie brown,L313536,u1595,MAX,Well hello.,1197
37546,m105,jackie brown,L313326,u1593,JACKIE,Well I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand with retirement benefits ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.,1197
37547,m105,jackie brown,L313325,u1595,MAX,Fifteen thousand.,1197
37548,m105,jackie brown,L313324,u1593,JACKIE,I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?,1197
37549,m105,jackie brown,L313323,u1595,MAX,Does something else worry you?,1197
37550,m105,jackie brown,L313321,u1593,JACKIE,Yeah.,1197
37551,m105,jackie brown,L313320,u1595,MAX,Bigger?,1197
37552,m105,jackie brown,L313319,u1593,JACKIE,My ass ain't the same.,1197
37553,m105,jackie brown,L313317,u1595,MAX,You know I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.,1197
37554,m105,jackie brown,L313316,u1593,JACKIE,It's different with men.,1197
37555,m105,jackie brown,L313315,u1595,MAX,I'm fine with it or I wouldn't of done it I did it to feel better about myself and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.,1197
37556,m105,jackie brown,L313314,u1593,JACKIE,How'd you feel about it?,1197
37557,m105,jackie brown,L313313,u1595,MAX,Okay I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.,1197
37558,m105,jackie brown,L313312,u1593,JACKIE,Really?,1197
37559,m105,jackie brown,L313311,u1595,MAX,It's not really something I think about.,1197
37560,m105,jackie brown,L313310,u1593,JACKIE,I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?,1197
37561,m105,jackie brown,L313309,u1595,MAX,You're not old. You look great.,1197
37562,m105,jackie brown,L313308,u1593,JACKIE,How do you feel about getting old?,1197
37563,m105,jackie brown,L313307,u1593,JACKIE,I ain't goin' to jail and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.,1197
37564,m105,jackie brown,L313306,u1595,MAX,It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.,1197
37565,m105,jackie brown,L313305,u1593,JACKIE,If I get let off. Otherwise fuck 'em.,1197
37566,m105,jackie brown,L313304,u1595,MAX,You're gonna offer to set him up?,1197
37567,m105,jackie brown,L313303,u1593,JACKIE,Same way I been doin' but first they got to let me go back to work.,1197
37568,m105,jackie brown,L313302,u1595,MAX,How do you get it out?,1197
37569,m105,jackie brown,L313300,u1595,MAX,No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.,1197
37570,m105,jackie brown,L313299,u1593,JACKIE,He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?,1197
37571,m105,jackie brown,L313298,u1595,MAX,Why?,1197
37572,m105,jackie brown,L313297,u1593,JACKIE,He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.,1197
37573,m105,jackie brown,L313296,u1593,JACKIE,We talked.,1197
37574,m105,jackie brown,L313295,u1595,MAX,What?... What'd you do?,1197
37575,m105,jackie brown,L313294,u1593,JACKIE,He came by.,1197
37576,m105,jackie brown,L313293,u1595,MAX,He called you?,1197
37577,m105,jackie brown,L313292,u1593,JACKIE,He told me last night.,1197
37578,m105,jackie brown,L313291,u1595,MAX,How'd you find that out?,1197
37579,m105,jackie brown,L313290,u1593,JACKIE,It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.,1197
37580,m105,jackie brown,L313289,u1595,MAX,Well if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you that'll only interest him up to a point.,1197
37581,m105,jackie brown,L313288,u1593,JACKIE,I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.,1197
37582,m105,jackie brown,L313287,u1595,MAX,What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.,1197
37583,m105,jackie brown,L313286,u1593,JACKIE,I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.,1197
37584,m105,jackie brown,L313285,u1595,MAX,Are you?,1197
37585,m105,jackie brown,L313284,u1593,JACKIE,I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows I'm still available.,1197
37586,m105,jackie brown,L313283,u1595,MAX,It's nice.,1197
37587,m105,jackie brown,L313282,u1593,JACKIE,'74 I think.,1197

37591,m105,jackie brown,L313278,u1593,JACKIE,Uh-huh.,1197
37592,m105,jackie brown,L313277,u1595,MAX,This is pretty.,1197
37593,m105,jackie brown,L313274,u1593,JACKIE,I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.,1197
37594,m105,jackie brown,L313273,u1595,MAX,You never got into the whole CD revolution?,1197
37595,m105,jackie brown,L313272,u1595,MAX,It looks nice.,1197
37596,m105,jackie brown,L313271,u1593,JACKIE,I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.,1197
37597,m105,jackie brown,L313270,u1595,MAX,Sure.,1197
37598,m105,jackie brown,L313269,u1593,JACKIE,Want to hear some music?,1197
37599,m105,jackie brown,L313268,u1593,JACKIE,Yeah.,1197
37600,m105,jackie brown,L313267,u1595,MAX,Somebody loan it to you?,1197
37601,m105,jackie brown,L313265,u1595,MAX,You went out this morning and bought a gun.,1197
37602,m105,jackie brown,L313264,u1593,JACKIE,What I couldn't hear you?,1197
37603,m105,jackie brown,L313263,u1595,MAX,You went out this morning and bought a gun?,1197
37604,m105,jackie brown,L313262,u1593,JACKIE,Thanks but I have my own now.,1197
37605,m105,jackie brown,L313260,u1595,MAX,Black's fine.,1197
37606,m105,jackie brown,L313259,u1593,JACKIE,I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.,1197
37607,m105,jackie brown,L313258,u1595,MAX,You get a chance to use it?,1197
37608,m105,jackie brown,L313257,u1593,JACKIE,I am. Have a seat.,1197
37609,m105,jackie brown,L313256,u1595,MAX,If you're having some.,1197
37610,m105,jackie brown,L313185,u1593,JACKIE,I think maybe I have more options than I thought.,1197
37611,m105,jackie brown,L313184,u1595,MAX,What'dya think?,1197
37612,m105,jackie brown,L313183,u1595,MAX,Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail don't you?,1197
37613,m105,jackie brown,L313182,u1593,JACKIE,But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.,1197
37614,m105,jackie brown,L313181,u1595,MAX,Well Jackie you got caught you're gonna have to give 'em something.,1197
37615,m105,jackie brown,L313180,u1593,JACKIE,Yeah if I cooperate.,1197
37616,m105,jackie brown,L313179,u1595,MAX,Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.,1197
37617,m105,jackie brown,L313178,u1593,JACKIE,Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job I can't hire a lawyer.,1197
37618,m105,jackie brown,L313177,u1595,MAX,If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law why not pack a hundred grand?,1197
37619,m105,jackie brown,L313176,u1593,JACKIE,That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars and his friend Mr. Walker in Mexico gave me the envelope.,1197
37620,m105,jackie brown,L313175,u1595,MAX,Cash poor?,1197
37621,m105,jackie brown,L313174,u1593,JACKIE,It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money but don't have cash?,1197
37622,m105,jackie brown,L313173,u1595,MAX,He's got that kinda money?,1197
37623,m105,jackie brown,L313172,u1593,JACKIE,With ten thousand? Nine.,1197
37624,m105,jackie brown,L313171,u1595,MAX,How many trips did you make?,1197
37625,m105,jackie brown,L313170,u1593,JACKIE,I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit so I never brought more than that.,1197
37626,m105,jackie brown,L313169,u1593,JACKIE,I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.,1197
37627,m105,jackie brown,L313168,u1595,MAX,'Cause if he busted you you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell make a case then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?,1197
37628,m105,jackie brown,L313167,u1593,JACKIE,It was the other guy who busted me.,1197
37629,m105,jackie brown,L313166,u1595,MAX,He's the one who wants you.,1197
37630,m105,jackie brown,L313165,u1593,JACKIE,Ray Nicolet with Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms.,1197
37631,m105,jackie brown,L313164,u1595,MAX,No you didn't. What branch?,1197
37632,m105,jackie brown,L313163,u1593,JACKIE,I didn't?,1197
37633,m105,jackie brown,L313162,u1595,MAX,You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D. but you didn't mention the Federal.,1197
37634,m105,jackie brown,L313161,u1593,JACKIE,The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.,1197
37635,m105,jackie brown,L313160,u1595,MAX,Same as you. Ten thousand.,1197
37636,m105,jackie brown,L313159,u1593,JACKIE,Ordell pick up his bond?,1197
37637,m105,jackie brown,L313158,u1595,MAX,I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.,1197
37638,m105,jackie brown,L313157,u1593,JACKIE,That's him. How do you know 'em?,1197
37639,m105,jackie brown,L313156,u1595,MAX,That would be Beaumont Livingston.,1197
37640,m105,jackie brown,L313153,u1593,JACKIE,Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.,1197
37641,m105,jackie brown,L313152,u1595,MAX,What did they want to know?,1197
37642,m105,jackie brown,L313151,u1593,JACKIE,I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.,1197
37643,m105,jackie brown,L313150,u1595,MAX,They wanted you to tell them what you know.,1197
37644,m105,jackie brown,L313148,u1595,MAX,You know who put the dope in your bag?,1197
37645,m105,jackie brown,L313147,u1593,JACKIE,Sure.,1197
37646,m105,jackie brown,L313146,u1595,MAX,But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession a few months of County time and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?,1197
37647,m105,jackie brown,L313145,u1593,JACKIE,Shit.,1197
37648,m105,jackie brown,L313144,u1595,MAX,I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.,1197
37649,m105,jackie brown,L313143,u1593,JACKIE,So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation maybe. Or I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?,1197
37650,m105,jackie brown,L313142,u1595,MAX,What have they told you?,1197
37651,m105,jackie brown,L313141,u1595,MAX,I am as a matter of fact.,1197
37652,m105,jackie brown,L313140,u1593,JACKIE,You're not tired of it?,1197
37653,m105,jackie brown,L313139,u1595,MAX,You know I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want I can help you look at your options.,1197
37654,m105,jackie brown,L313138,u1593,JACKIE,She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer find out what my options are.,1197
37655,m105,jackie brown,L313137,u1595,MAX,Was she helpful?,1197
37656,m105,jackie brown,L313136,u1593,JACKIE,Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.,1197
37657,m105,jackie brown,L313135,u1595,MAX,What's your brand?,1197
37658,m105,jackie brown,L313134,u1593,JACKIE,That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.,1197
37659,m105,jackie brown,L313133,u1595,MAX,Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.,1197
37660,m105,jackie brown,L313132,u1593,JACKIE,You gain weight?,1197
37661,m105,jackie brown,L313130,u1595,MAX,Great.,1197
37662,m105,jackie brown,L313129,u1593,JACKIE,'Cause I look like I just got outta jail that's why. You droppin' me off at home right? There's a place by me.,1197
37663,m105,jackie brown,L313128,u1595,MAX,Why does it need to be dark?,1197
37664,m105,jackie brown,L313127,u1593,JACKIE,That doesn't sound dark.,1197
37665,m105,jackie brown,L313126,u1595,MAX,It's kind of a sports bar,1197
37666,m105,jackie brown,L313125,u1593,JACKIE,Is it dark?,1197
37667,m105,jackie brown,L313124,u1595,MAX,We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.,1197
37668,m105,jackie brown,L313123,u1593,JACKIE,I'd love one but not there.,1197
37669,m105,jackie brown,L313122,u1595,MAX,I thought you might want a drink?,1197
37670,m105,jackie brown,L313121,u1593,JACKIE,Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?,1197
37671,m105,jackie brown,L313120,u1595,MAX,It's okay. It's a cop hangout.,1197
37672,m105,jackie brown,L313119,u1593,JACKIE,I don't think so.,1197
37673,m105,jackie brown,L313118,u1595,MAX,Sure ever been to the Riverbottom?,1197

37709,m105,jackie brown,L314077,u1593,JACKIE,I thought you were watching him.,1197
37712,m105,jackie brown,L314072,u1593,JACKIE,If it'll make you happy.,1197
37714,m105,jackie brown,L314070,u1593,JACKIE,I have no idea.,1197
37716,m105,jackie brown,L314068,u1593,JACKIE,I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?,1197
37719,m105,jackie brown,L314065,u1593,JACKIE,Not in the fitting room.,1197
37721,m105,jackie brown,L314063,u1593,JACKIE,I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore 'cause that's where you were last time but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that did you? I knew I was under surveillance so when I couldn't spot anybody I started yelling.,1197
37723,m105,jackie brown,L314061,u1593,JACKIE,I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.,1197
37725,m105,jackie brown,L314059,u1593,JACKIE,She didn't give me one. I told you before Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in grabs the shopping bag and takes off. What am I supposed to do go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.,1197
37727,m105,jackie brown,L314057,u1593,JACKIE,Because I didn't have it. Ray I swear Melanie came in and grabbed it.  And someone killed her for it.,1197
37729,m105,jackie brown,L314055,u1593,JACKIE,I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit see if I liked it. If I did get them to wrap it up and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda give her the bag with fifty thousand and go home.,1197
37731,m105,jackie brown,L314053,u1593,JACKIE,I thought I did.,1197
37732,m105,jackie brown,L313883,u1593,JACKIE,Si.,1197
37734,m105,jackie brown,L313881,u1593,JACKIE,How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?,1197
37736,m105,jackie brown,L313879,u1593,JACKIE,That would be one point of view.,1197
37738,m105,jackie brown,L313877,u1593,JACKIE,Yes. All those things are true.,1197
37740,m105,jackie brown,L313875,u1593,JACKIE,Uh-huh.,1197

37750,m105,jackie brown,L313860,u1593,JACKIE,You said that the last time.,1197
37751,m105,jackie brown,L313829,u1593,JACKIE,Right. Everything's the same except one change...,1197
37753,m105,jackie brown,L313827,u1593,JACKIE,Uh-huh.,1197
37755,m105,jackie brown,L313825,u1593,JACKIE,She didn't say.,1197
37757,m105,jackie brown,L313823,u1593,JACKIE,Uh-huh.,1197
37759,m105,jackie brown,L313821,u1593,JACKIE,I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.,1197
37761,m105,jackie brown,L313819,u1593,JACKIE,I'm sure that was the idea.,1197
37763,m105,jackie brown,L313817,u1593,JACKIE,It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything but she's not part of it and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.,1197
37765,m105,jackie brown,L313815,u1593,JACKIE,White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.,1197
37767,m105,jackie brown,L313813,u1593,JACKIE,Not yet.,1197
37771,m105,jackie brown,L313808,u1593,JACKIE,I imagine shit needs to be done.,1197
37773,m105,jackie brown,L313806,u1593,JACKIE,What for?,1197
37775,m105,jackie brown,L313804,u1593,JACKIE,Not really.,1197
37777,m105,jackie brown,L313802,u1593,JACKIE,This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there but I can find out.,1197
37779,m105,jackie brown,L313800,u1593,JACKIE,Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.,1197
37780,m105,jackie brown,L313647,u1593,JACKIE,A Broadway shopping bag.,1197
37782,m105,jackie brown,L313636,u1593,JACKIE,I thought you were going to let this one through.,1197
37784,m105,jackie brown,L313634,u1593,JACKIE,What are you doing?,1197
37786,m105,jackie brown,L313365,u1593,JACKIE,Short of wearing a wire I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help I need permission to leave the country and immunity.,1197
37788,m105,jackie brown,L313363,u1593,JACKIE,He told me. Besides why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?,1197
37790,m105,jackie brown,L313361,u1593,JACKIE,No.,1197
37792,m105,jackie brown,L313359,u1593,JACKIE,He sells guns.,1197
37794,m105,jackie brown,L313355,u1593,JACKIE,You never asked me if I did or not.,1197
37796,m105,jackie brown,L313351,u1593,JACKIE,If I'm working I can help you.,1197
37798,m105,jackie brown,L313349,u1593,JACKIE,I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow I'm fired.,1197
37800,m105,jackie brown,L313347,u1593,JACKIE,I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.,1197

38338,m105,jackie brown,L313074,u1595,MAX,You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into you seem to be getting away with it so more power to you. Okay you want another bond and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate present it to the court fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --,1197

38353,m105,jackie brown,L313059,u1598,ORDELL,Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.,1197

38361,m105,jackie brown,L313051,u1598,ORDELL,They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.,1197

God Ann when you're with another person and you're... inside them you're so vulnerable you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.,865
62677,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497951,u2687,ANN,But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?,865

62691,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497932,u2687,ANN,Yeah you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you and have all these little theories. I'm still learning I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now fine.,865
62692,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497931,u2691,GRAHAM,All right you want to talk about lies let's talk about lies Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself.

You won't answer a question about Elizabeth but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore you'll have to say something.,865
62696,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497926,u2691,GRAHAM,I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.,865

62710,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497912,u2691,GRAHAM,Yes.,865

62713,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497909,u2687,ANN,But how do you know for sure you have to try to find a way to fig --,865
62714,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497908,u2691,GRAHAM,Ann it could happen to me all over again don't you see? I could start to --,865
62715,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497907,u2687,ANN,But I don't understand --,865

62720,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497902,u2691,GRAHAM,Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically or are you asking me for real right now?,865
62721,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497901,u2687,ANN,So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you I mean?,865
62722,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497900,u2691,GRAHAM,That's very flattering.,865
62723,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497899,u2687,ANN,But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.,865
62724,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497898,u2691,GRAHAM,I... I can't answer that precisely.,865
62725,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497897,u2687,ANN,But if you were?,865
62726,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497896,u2691,GRAHAM,I'm not in love with you.,865
62727,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497895,u2687,ANN,If you were in love with me would you?,865
62728,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497894,u2691,GRAHAM,I'm not planning on it.,865
62729,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497893,u2687,ANN,You're really never going to make love again?,865
62730,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497892,u2687,ANN,Yeah I know but somehow I expect that from her I mean she'll do it with almost anybody I don't know I shouldn't stick up for her I guess but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo I want to watch him die!!,865
62731,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497891,u2691,GRAHAM,You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.,865

62734,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497888,u2687,ANN,I'm babbling.,865
62735,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497887,u2691,GRAHAM,Interesting analogy.,865
62736,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497886,u2687,ANN,Kind of. I mean John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make and I don't need anymore tables.,865
62737,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497885,u2691,GRAHAM,And you feel the same way with John?,865
62738,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497884,u2687,ANN,Subtlety yes. No subtlety. Plus I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean that other person I told you about I enjoyed making love with him a lot but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.,865
62739,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497883,u2691,GRAHAM,Subtlety?,865
62740,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497882,u2687,ANN,I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine there's no...,865
62741,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497881,u2691,GRAHAM,If you do get out of your marriage will you continue to be inhibited?,865
62742,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497880,u2687,ANN,Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.,865
62743,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497879,u2691,GRAHAM,Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?,865
62744,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497878,u2687,ANN,I don't know anymore. I thought I was but obviously I was wrong.,865
62745,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497877,u2691,GRAHAM,How could I with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?,865
62746,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497876,u2687,ANN,Don't you get lonely?,865
62747,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497875,u2691,GRAHAM,Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.,865
62748,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497874,u2687,ANN,And now you can?,865
62749,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497873,u2691,GRAHAM,I loved her for how good she made me feel and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.,865
62750,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497872,u2687,ANN,How come?,865
62751,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497871,u2691,GRAHAM,Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.,865
62752,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497870,u2687,ANN,So you lied to her?,865
62753,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497868,u2687,ANN,What was the problem?,865
62754,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497867,u2691,GRAHAM,No it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.,865
62755,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497866,u2687,ANN,So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?,865
62756,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497865,u2691,GRAHAM,Her name was Elizabeth.,865

62761,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497860,u2687,ANN,You said you weren't always impotent.,865
62762,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497859,u2691,GRAHAM,Can't.,865
62763,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497858,u2687,ANN,Can't or won't?,865
62764,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497857,u2691,GRAHAM,If I can't do it all I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.,865
62765,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497856,u2687,ANN,Why not?,865
62766,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497855,u2691,GRAHAM,No.,865

62772,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497849,u2691,GRAHAM,I thought I made that clear before when I said I would go down on you.,865
62773,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497848,u2687,ANN,Have you fantasized about me?,865
62774,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497847,u2687,ANN,Yes.,865
62775,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497846,u2691,GRAHAM,About me?,865
62776,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497845,u2687,ANN,I fantasized about you.,865

62782,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497839,u2687,ANN,Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff and I hate that I don't want to be like her I don't want to be like her!!,865
62783,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497838,u2691,GRAHAM,Why?,865
62784,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497837,u2687,ANN,Yes. Whenever... all right look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive I wonder what it would be like with him I mean I'm just curious I don't act on it but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!,865
62785,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497836,u2691,GRAHAM,Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?,865

62820,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497744,u2691,GRAHAM,I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.,865
62821,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497743,u2687,ANN,What difference does it make why I do it?,865
62822,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497742,u2691,GRAHAM,Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.,865
62823,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497741,u2687,ANN,Don't you want to make one?,865
62824,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497740,u2691,GRAHAM,Do you think that's such a good idea?,865

62855,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497371,u2687,ANN,What... what are these interviews about?,865
62856,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497370,u2691,GRAHAM,Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.,865
62857,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497369,u2687,ANN,Why not?,865
62858,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497368,u2691,GRAHAM,No.,865
62859,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497367,u2687,ANN,Can we look at one?,865
62860,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497366,u2691,GRAHAM,Yes.,865
62861,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497365,u2687,ANN,All of these are interviews?,865
62862,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497364,u2691,GRAHAM,Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.,865
62863,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497362,u2691,GRAHAM,Not really.,865
62864,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497361,u2687,ANN,You went out with her?,865
62865,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497360,u2691,GRAHAM,Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.,865
62866,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497358,u2691,GRAHAM,Donna?,865
62867,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497357,u2687,ANN,Who's Donna?,865
62868,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497356,u2691,GRAHAM,Oh just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.,865
62869,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497355,u2687,ANN,What kind of personal project?,865
62870,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497354,u2691,GRAHAM,It's a personal project I'm working on.,865
62871,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497353,u2687,ANN,I can see that. What are they?,865
62872,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497352,u2691,GRAHAM,Videotapes.,865
62873,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497351,u2687,ANN,What are these?,865
62874,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497348,u2687,ANN,Somehow I imagined books. I thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time.,865
62875,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497347,u2691,GRAHAM,Not much to see I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.,865
62876,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497346,u2687,ANN,I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.,865
62877,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497345,u2691,GRAHAM,Nothing I can't finish later.,865
62878,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497344,u2687,ANN,Are you in the middle of something?,865
62879,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497343,u2691,GRAHAM,Ann. Hello.,865
62880,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497342,u2687,ANN,Hi!,865
62881,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497259,u2691,GRAHAM,That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma isn't it?,865
62882,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497258,u2687,ANN,So since I've never had sex with you by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.,865
62883,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497257,u2691,GRAHAM,Basically yes.,865
62884,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497256,u2687,ANN,Now you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately right?,865
62885,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497255,u2691,GRAHAM,Well I wasn't always impotent.,865
62886,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497254,u2687,ANN,Excuse me for asking but how would you know?,865
62887,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497253,u2691,GRAHAM,Oh see I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.,865
62888,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497252,u2687,ANN,Of course not.,865
62889,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497251,u2691,GRAHAM,You had sex with you therapist?,865
62890,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497250,u2687,ANN,Well my therapist knows me intimately.,865
62891,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497249,u2691,GRAHAM,I believe in it for some people. I mean for me it was silly I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.,865
62892,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497248,u2687,ANN,So you don't believe in therapy?,865
62893,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497247,u2691,GRAHAM,Hah! No I'm not. Actually I used to be but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course I lied to him constantly so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...,865
62894,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497246,u2687,ANN,Aren't you?,865
62895,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497245,u2691,GRAHAM,You're in therapy?,865
62896,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497244,u2687,ANN,My therapist said that --,865
62897,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497243,u2691,GRAHAM,They are looking at you. Ann you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.,865
62898,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497242,u2687,ANN,What?,865
62899,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497241,u2691,GRAHAM,Well I've been watching you. I've watched you eat I've watched you speak I've watched the way you move and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?,865
62900,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497240,u2687,ANN,Why do you say I'm self-conscious?,865
62901,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497239,u2691,GRAHAM,I am self-conscious but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.,865
62902,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497238,u2687,ANN,Well... are you self-conscious about it?,865
62903,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497237,u2691,GRAHAM,Not usually. I mean honestly I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.,865
62904,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497236,u2687,ANN,Does it bother you?,865
62905,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497235,u2691,GRAHAM,Well let me put it this way: I cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person. So for all practical purposes I am impotent.,865
62906,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497234,u2687,ANN,You are?,865
62907,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497233,u2691,GRAHAM,Impotent.,865
62908,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497232,u2687,ANN,You're what?,865
62909,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497230,u2691,GRAHAM,Agreed.,865
62910,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497229,u2687,ANN,As long as it's not... gross you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine like something about you.,865
62911,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497228,u2691,GRAHAM,Do you want me to?,865
62912,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497227,u2687,ANN,So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?,865
62913,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497226,u2687,ANN,I don't know he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.,865
62914,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497225,u2691,GRAHAM,Why is that?,865
62915,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497224,u2687,ANN,Yeah actually I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.,865
62916,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497223,u2691,GRAHAM,Do you want them?,865
62917,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497222,u2687,ANN,Kids? What about them?,865
62918,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497221,u2691,GRAHAM,So what about kids?,865
62919,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497220,u2687,ANN,Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very.,865
62920,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497219,u2691,GRAHAM,I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.,865
62921,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497218,u2687,ANN,Do you understand what I'm trying to say?,865
62922,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497217,u2687,ANN,Okay. I think... I think sex is overrated. I think people place way too much importance on it. And I think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. I m not saying women don't want it I just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do.  I'm getting confused.,865
62923,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497216,u2691,GRAHAM,It's up to you. But I warn you if you tell me something personal I might do the same.,865
62924,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497215,u2687,ANN,Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't anyway.,865
62925,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497214,u2687,ANN,Right right. I don't feel connected to many people either. Other than John.,865
62926,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497213,u2691,GRAHAM,I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.,865
62927,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497212,u2691,GRAHAM,Hmm. Well maybe you are. Really I wouldn't pay much attention.,865
62928,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497211,u2687,ANN,I feel like they do.,865
62929,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497210,u2691,GRAHAM,Yeah I know. I mean I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?,865
62930,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497208,u2691,GRAHAM,How do you mean?,865
62931,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497207,u2687,ANN,Maybe you'll understand this because you know John but he confuses me sometimes.,865
62932,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497191,u2687,ANN,Okay I will!!,865
62933,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497190,u2691,GRAHAM,No.,865
62934,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497189,u2687,ANN,Would you mind?,865
62935,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497187,u2691,GRAHAM,Lawyers.,865
62936,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497186,u2687,ANN,What's the first?,865
62937,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497185,u2691,GRAHAM,Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes only a liar doesn't pay taxes I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.,865
62938,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497173,u2687,ANN,Who's Elizabeth?,865
62939,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497172,u2691,GRAHAM,I don't know.,865
62940,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497162,u2687,ANN,Younger.,865
62941,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497161,u2691,GRAHAM,Sister older or younger?,865
62942,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497160,u2687,ANN,Mother father sister.,865
62943,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497157,u2687,ANN,Thank you.,865
62944,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497156,u2691,GRAHAM,This food is excellent.,865
62945,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497149,u2691,GRAHAM,I would imagine that we are now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom finally.,865
62946,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497148,u2687,ANN,That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.,865
62947,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497147,u2691,GRAHAM,Oh lots of reasons most of them boring. But up until I dropped out John and I were... very much alike.,865
62948,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497146,u2687,ANN,Why'd you drop out?,865
62949,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497145,u2691,GRAHAM,I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.,865
62950,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497144,u2687,ANN,Why? Didn't you know him well?,865
62951,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497143,u2691,GRAHAM,Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.,865
62952,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497142,u2687,ANN,Nine years?,865
62953,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497141,u2691,GRAHAM,Nine years.,865
62954,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497140,u2687,ANN,How long has it been since you've seen John?,865
62955,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497139,u2691,GRAHAM,Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.,865
62956,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497137,u2691,GRAHAM,Anyway I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.,865
62957,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497136,u2687,ANN,Oh uh-huh.,865
62958,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497135,u2691,GRAHAM,Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance when I was twelve I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to and then were crystallized in that eleven minutes.,865
62959,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497134,u2687,ANN,Oh definitely. I mean just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.,865
62960,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497133,u2691,GRAHAM,Yes. So you feel security stability. Like things are going to last awhile.,865
62961,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497132,u2687,ANN,...free-lance. You know.,865
62962,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497131,u2687,ANN,Well... well the clich√© about the security of it that's really true. We own a house and I really like that you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner so he has a steady job and he's not some...,865
62963,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497130,u2691,GRAHAM,What about it do you like? I'm not being critical I'd really like to know.,865
62964,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497129,u2687,ANN,Oh I like it. I like it very much.,865
62965,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497128,u2691,GRAHAM,No I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?,865
62966,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497127,u2687,ANN,You play an instrument?,865
62967,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497126,u2691,GRAHAM,Oh. Well I did. I was in a band once and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.,865
62968,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497125,u2687,ANN,No not really.,865
62969,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497124,u2691,GRAHAM,I used to take great pleasure in that being purposefully different rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?,865
62970,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497123,u2687,ANN,Well...,865
62971,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497122,u2691,GRAHAM,Oh. Well maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.,865
62972,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497121,u2687,ANN,No I think you look... fine.,865
62973,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497120,u2691,GRAHAM,Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?,865
62974,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497119,u2687,ANN,Oh uh-huh.,865
62975,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497118,u2691,GRAHAM,Yeah I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.,865
62976,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497117,u2687,ANN,Graham is an unusual name.,865
62977,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497116,u2691,GRAHAM,Curious.,865
62978,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497115,u2687,ANN,No. Why?,865
62979,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497114,u2691,GRAHAM,Yes.,865
62980,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497113,u2687,ANN,Television?,865
62981,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497112,u2691,GRAHAM,Have you ever been on television?,865
62982,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497111,u2687,ANN,Oh.,865
62983,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497110,u2691,GRAHAM,Yes.  Oh you mean to bring in! No. Yes I have some other things no I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.,865
62984,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497109,u2687,ANN,Do you have other things?,865
62985,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497108,u2691,GRAHAM,Oh no problem. It can wait.,865
62986,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497107,u2687,ANN,We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --,865
62987,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497106,u2687,ANN,Oh. Well please sit down.,865
62988,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497105,u2691,GRAHAM,False alarm.,865
62989,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497104,u2687,ANN,That was quick.,865
62990,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497098,u2691,GRAHAM,Graham Dalton.,865
62991,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497097,u2687,ANN,Yes?,865
62992,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497096,u2691,GRAHAM,Ann?,865
62993,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497827,u2687,ANN,Yes.,865
62996,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497821,u2687,ANN,I have thought about it yes.,865
62997,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497810,u2687,ANN,Not very often.,865
62999,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497803,u2687,ANN,He does.,865
63001,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497800,u2687,ANN,Yes.,865
63003,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497774,u2687,ANN,Yes!,865
63005,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497771,u2687,ANN,I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.,865
63007,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497769,u2687,ANN,No but I wanted to. I really wanted to partially just to piss you off.,865
63009,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497767,u2687,ANN,I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.,865
63011,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497762,u2687,ANN,We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.,865
63013,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497760,u2687,ANN,I want out of this marriage.,865
63015,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497758,u2687,ANN,I want out of this marriage.,865
63017,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497668,u2687,ANN,I know.,865
63019,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497666,u2687,ANN,I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.,865
63021,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497664,u2687,ANN,I didn't say it was rational I just said I was convinced.,865
63023,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497662,u2687,ANN,Loud.,865
63025,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497660,u2687,ANN,I'm sorry too. I... I get these ideas in my head you know and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia I don't know why.,865
63027,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497658,u2687,ANN,You've made your point.,865
63028,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497656,u2687,ANN,Always the lawyer.,865
63030,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497654,u2687,ANN,Why don't I believe you?,865
63032,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497652,u2687,ANN,But I'm not.,865
63034,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497650,u2687,ANN,Is that supposed to comfort me?,865
63036,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497648,u2687,ANN,My sister for one. Is that who it is?,865
63038,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497646,u2687,ANN,I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.,865
63040,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497644,u2687,ANN,If I'm right I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.,865
63042,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497642,u2687,ANN,Well are you?,865
63044,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497640,u2687,ANN,Are you having an affair?,865
63047,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497637,u2687,ANN,Who'd you have lunch with?,865
63049,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497635,u2687,ANN,That's interesting because I didn't leave a message.,865
63051,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497633,u2687,ANN,Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?,865
63053,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497631,u2687,ANN,I called you Tuesday at 3:30 and they said you weren't in. Do you remember where you were?,865
63055,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497629,u2687,ANN,John?,865
63057,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497175,u2687,ANN,Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District there are some nice little places there garage apartments and stuff.,865
63059,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497170,u2687,ANN,Oh we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.,865
63060,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497152,u2687,ANN,You did that?,865
63062,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497520,u2687,ANN,I know but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.,865
63064,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497518,u2687,ANN,Because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and I just hate her she's such a little slut I thought that in high school and I think that now. Why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal? I mean it's okay and everything but I don't understand when people let it control them control their lives why do they do that?,865
63066,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497516,u2687,ANN,I hate my sister.,865
63067,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497340,u2687,ANN,But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way right?,865
63069,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497338,u2687,ANN,Yes.,865
63071,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497336,u2687,ANN,Not really.,865
63073,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497334,u2687,ANN,Yes.,865
63075,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497332,u2687,ANN,Yes.,865
63077,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497330,u2687,ANN,I guess.,865
63079,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497328,u2687,ANN,What do you mean? I don't understand.,865
63081,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497326,u2687,ANN,That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well he said a lot of stuff.,865
63083,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497324,u2687,ANN,I've been thinking about it for awhile and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.,865
63085,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497274,u2687,ANN,I guess but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon you know? It's just boring. I don't know he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot being honest and I like that I felt comfortable around him.  After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.,865
63087,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497272,u2687,ANN,What do you mean like physically?,865
63089,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497270,u2687,ANN,No he left last week.,865
63091,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497268,u2687,ANN,Oh Graham. No I didn't talk to him about that. Actually that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well like John you know? I mean he said they had gone to school together so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character I mean he's kind of arty but okay you know?,865
63093,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497266,u2687,ANN,What visitor?,865
63095,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497264,u2687,ANN,Well the cumulative effect is not good let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.,865
63097,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497262,u2687,ANN,Yes it's this radioactive gas in the ground and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up and -- you've never heard of this?,865
63099,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497260,u2687,ANN,Well I don't know. The week started off okay but then I was outside watering the plants and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor and --,865
63100,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497067,u2687,ANN,Well kind of recently I guess. But not too recently.,865
63102,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497065,u2687,ANN,Well I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid and kind of uh I don't know and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage you know?,865
63104,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497063,u2687,ANN,God no.,865
63106,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497061,u2687,ANN,What do you mean?,865
63108,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497059,u2687,ANN,But see he stopped before I got that feeling that's why it seems weird to me. I mean I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile and I would except it never occurs to me I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.,865
63110,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497057,u2687,ANN,Oh yeah.  But see I've never really been into sex that much I mean I like it and everything it just does't freak me out I wouldn't miss it you know? But anyway lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said it's not that I miss it but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.,865
63112,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497055,u2687,ANN,About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.,865
63114,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497053,u2687,ANN,Fine I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.,865
63116,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497051,u2687,ANN,Yeah I know.,865
63118,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497049,u2687,ANN,I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset I mean it's his house really he pays the mortgage.,865
63120,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497047,u2687,ANN,No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean I would've said yes I just wish he would've asked.,865
63122,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497039,u2687,ANN,Well do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean maybe they do but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.,865
63124,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497037,u2687,ANN,Yeah so?,865
63126,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497035,u2687,ANN,What do you mean?,865
63128,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497033,u2687,ANN,Well this weekend John was taking out the garbage and he kept spilling things out of the container and I started imagining a container that grew garbage like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself and how could you stop that if it started happening?,865
63130,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497031,u2687,ANN,Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.,865
63132,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497029,u2687,ANN,Nothing. I mean nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?,865
63134,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497992,u2688,CYNTHIA,Bye.,865
63135,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497991,u2687,ANN,Bye.,865
63136,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497990,u2688,CYNTHIA,Okay.,865
63137,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497989,u2687,ANN,I get real busy between two and four.,865
63138,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497988,u2688,CYNTHIA,No.,865
63139,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497987,u2687,ANN,Do you have my work number?,865
63140,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497985,u2687,ANN,Well. I can't stay.,865
63141,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497984,u2688,CYNTHIA,Thank you.,865
63142,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497597,u2687,ANN,Thirty-two dollars.,865
63143,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497596,u2688,CYNTHIA,So what's my share of the dress?,865
63144,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497582,u2688,CYNTHIA,Hold on.,865
63145,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497581,u2687,ANN,I was just trying to --,865
63146,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497577,u2687,ANN,It does not.,865
63147,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497576,u2688,CYNTHIA,It looks like a tablecloth.,865
63148,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497575,u2687,ANN,It's a sun dress.,865
63149,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497574,u2688,CYNTHIA,What is it?,865
63150,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497573,u2687,ANN,Here it is.,865
63151,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497564,u2688,CYNTHIA,Then why do you keep asking about it?,865
63152,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497563,u2687,ANN,I don't want to discuss it.,865
63153,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497562,u2688,CYNTHIA,Ann I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it I did and if it doesn't bother me why should it bother you?,865
63154,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497561,u2687,ANN,You are in serious trouble.,865
63155,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497560,u2688,CYNTHIA,No. I don't think they all did what I did.,865
63156,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497559,u2687,ANN,So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?,865
63157,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497558,u2688,CYNTHIA,He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?,865
63158,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497557,u2687,ANN,That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him he's... perverted.,865
63159,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497556,u2688,CYNTHIA,I feel like I do.,865
63160,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497555,u2687,ANN,You know what I mean you don't even know him!,865
63161,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497554,u2688,CYNTHIA,You couldn't do it period.,865
63162,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497553,u2687,ANN,I mean I couldn't do that in front of John even.,865
63163,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497552,u2688,CYNTHIA,Why?,865
63164,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497551,u2687,ANN,I can't believe you did that!!,865
63165,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497550,u2688,CYNTHIA,Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?,865
63166,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497549,u2687,ANN,You are in trouble.,865
63167,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497548,u2688,CYNTHIA,In front of him Ann yes.,865
63168,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497545,u2687,ANN,You touched him?,865

63170,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497543,u2687,ANN,Did he touch you?,865
63171,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497542,u2688,CYNTHIA,Well it's too late now isn't it?,865
63172,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497541,u2687,ANN,You don't know that for sure.,865
63173,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497540,u2688,CYNTHIA,He wouldn't do that.,865
63174,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497539,u2687,ANN,Cynthia who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.,865
63175,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497538,u2688,CYNTHIA,I wanted him to see me.,865
63176,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497537,u2687,ANN,But why did you want to?,865
63177,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497536,u2688,CYNTHIA,Because I wanted to.,865
63178,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497535,u2687,ANN,Why did you do that?,865

63182,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497529,u2687,ANN,Did he ask you to take your clothes off?,865
63183,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497528,u2688,CYNTHIA,Apparently.,865
63184,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497527,u2687,ANN,Oh so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape but you won't tell your own sister?,865

63201,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497394,u2687,ANN,Because I never got around to it.,865

63205,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497390,u2687,ANN,I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.,865
63206,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497322,u2687,ANN,I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.,865

63210,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497318,u2687,ANN,I just thought it might --,865
63211,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497317,u2688,CYNTHIA,Will you stop? Jesus.,865
63212,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497316,u2687,ANN,Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --,865

63219,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497309,u2687,ANN,And... do whatever it is you do.,865
63220,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497308,u2688,CYNTHIA,And what?,865
63221,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497307,u2687,ANN,I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...,865
63222,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497306,u2688,CYNTHIA,Why? Just give me the address you won't even have to be involved.,865
63223,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497305,u2687,ANN,Let me talk to him first.,865
63224,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497304,u2688,CYNTHIA,Oh please. Okay so give me the Zen master's address I'll think of a reason to stop by.,865
63225,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497303,u2687,ANN,He's not getting a phone he doesn't like talking on the phone.,865
63226,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497302,u2688,CYNTHIA,What are you talking about?,865
63227,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497301,u2687,ANN,But he won't.,865
63228,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497300,u2688,CYNTHIA,Well I'll call him when he does.,865
63229,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497299,u2687,ANN,He doesn't have a phone.,865
63230,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497298,u2688,CYNTHIA,Ann you don't have a clue. Look I don't even know why we're discussing this I'll just call him myself.,865
63231,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497297,u2687,ANN,I have a pretty good idea.,865
63232,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497295,u2687,ANN,Oh for God's sake. Really Cynthia really I don't think he's your type.,865
63233,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497294,u2688,CYNTHIA,I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.,865
63234,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497293,u2687,ANN,Well I wonder why.,865
63235,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497292,u2688,CYNTHIA,Ann you always underestimate me.,865
63236,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497291,u2687,ANN,Well he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing anyway.,865
63237,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497290,u2688,CYNTHIA,I say it because it's descriptive.,865
63238,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497289,u2687,ANN,You know what. You say it just to irritate me.,865
63239,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497288,u2688,CYNTHIA,What?,865
63240,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497287,u2687,ANN,Do you have to say that?,865
63241,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497286,u2688,CYNTHIA,Besides even if I decided to fuck his brains out what business is that of yours?,865
63242,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497285,u2688,CYNTHIA,Jesus Ann get a life. I just asked what he looked like.,865
63243,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497284,u2687,ANN,Why so you can go after him?,865
63244,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497283,u2688,CYNTHIA,I just want to know what he looks like is all.,865
63245,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497282,u2687,ANN,Why?,865
63246,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497281,u2688,CYNTHIA,Uh-huh. So what's he look like?,865
63247,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497280,u2687,ANN,Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know unusual.,865
63248,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497279,u2688,CYNTHIA,Is he? Strange I mean?,865
63249,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497278,u2687,ANN,No not at all. Actually I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange.,865
63250,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497277,u2688,CYNTHIA,Must be nice. So what's he like is he like John?,865
63251,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497276,u2687,ANN,I don't know. He went to school here then he was in New York for awhile then Philadelphia and then just kind of travelling around.,865
63252,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497579,u2687,ANN,So will you someday.,865
63254,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497572,u2687,ANN,It was busy.,865
63256,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497570,u2687,ANN,I wish you'd get an answering machine.,865
63257,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497547,u2687,ANN,Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.,865
63259,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497531,u2687,ANN,Did you take your clothes off?,865
63261,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497624,u2691,GRAHAM,No.,865
63262,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497623,u2688,CYNTHIA,Goddamit give me my tape then.,865
63263,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497622,u2691,GRAHAM,I'm sorry. I can't do it.,865
63264,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497621,u2688,CYNTHIA,I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.,865
63265,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497620,u2691,GRAHAM,Cynthia I don't know.,865
63266,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497619,u2688,CYNTHIA,Well what the hell am I supposed to do?,865
63267,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497618,u2691,GRAHAM,I would.,865
63268,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497617,u2688,CYNTHIA,How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?,865
63269,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497616,u2691,GRAHAM,No.,865
63270,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497615,u2688,CYNTHIA,So make an exception.,865
63271,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497614,u2691,GRAHAM,Ouch. Okay I deserved that. Cynthia don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.,865
63272,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497613,u2688,CYNTHIA,But I want you to do it I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.,865
63273,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497612,u2691,GRAHAM,I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.,865
63274,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497611,u2688,CYNTHIA,Now who the hell is going to do that for me?,865
63275,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497610,u2691,GRAHAM,No. You'll have to get somebody else.,865
63276,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497609,u2688,CYNTHIA,I can't talk you into it?,865
63277,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497608,u2691,GRAHAM,I never do more than one. I'm sorry.,865
63278,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497607,u2688,CYNTHIA,No? Not even one more?,865
63279,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497606,u2691,GRAHAM,No.,865
63280,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497605,u2688,CYNTHIA,I'd like to make another tape.,865
63281,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497604,u2691,GRAHAM,Okay.,865
63282,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497603,u2688,CYNTHIA,Look I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here okay?,865
63283,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497602,u2688,CYNTHIA,Hi.,865
63284,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497601,u2691,GRAHAM,Hello.,865
63285,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497512,u2688,CYNTHIA,He doesn't have to tell me.,865
63286,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497511,u2691,GRAHAM,Is that what he tells you?,865
63287,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497510,u2688,CYNTHIA,John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.,865
63288,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497509,u2691,GRAHAM,Different.,865
63289,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497508,u2688,CYNTHIA,Prettier than Ann?,865
63290,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497507,u2691,GRAHAM,Yes.,865
63291,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497506,u2688,CYNTHIA,Do you think I'm pretty?,865
63292,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497505,u2691,GRAHAM,Yes.,865
63293,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497504,u2688,CYNTHIA,Do you like the way I look?,865
63294,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497503,u2691,GRAHAM,If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.,865
63295,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497502,u2688,CYNTHIA,Would you like me to take my pants off?,865
63296,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497494,u2688,CYNTHIA,Then I started moving my hand and then he stopped talking.,865
63297,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497493,u2691,GRAHAM,Then what happened?,865
63298,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497492,u2688,CYNTHIA,He said that my hand felt good.,865
63299,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497491,u2691,GRAHAM,What did he say?,865
63300,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497490,u2688,CYNTHIA,It was warmer than I thought it would be and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now the organ itself seemed like a separate thing a separate entity to me. I mean after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.,865
63301,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497489,u2691,GRAHAM,What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like and then what did it really feel like?,865
63302,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497488,u2688,CYNTHIA,No. If anything after I looked at it awhile it got more interesting. It had character you know?,865
63303,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497487,u2691,GRAHAM,Were you disappointed?,865
63304,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497486,u2688,CYNTHIA,Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything I thought it would be smooth like a test tube.,865
63305,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497485,u2691,GRAHAM,What did you think? Did it look like you expected?,865
63306,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497484,u2688,CYNTHIA,Very much live.,865
63307,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497483,u2691,GRAHAM,Live or in a photograph or film of some sort?,865
63308,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497482,u2688,CYNTHIA,When I was fourteen.,865
63309,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497481,u2691,GRAHAM,How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?,865
63310,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497480,u2688,CYNTHIA,No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer and then his family moved away. To Cleveland actually.,865
63311,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497479,u2691,GRAHAM,Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?,865
63312,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497477,u2691,GRAHAM,Your first sexual experience.,865
63313,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497476,u2688,CYNTHIA,My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?,865
63314,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497475,u2691,GRAHAM,Describe for me your first sexual experience.,865
63315,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497474,u2688,CYNTHIA,Cynthia Patrice Bishop.,865
63316,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497473,u2691,GRAHAM,I am now recording. Tell me your name.,865
63317,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497472,u2691,GRAHAM,Just a moment.,865
63318,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497471,u2688,CYNTHIA,I'd rather sit. Are you ready?,865
63319,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497470,u2691,GRAHAM,Whichever you prefer.,865
63320,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497469,u2688,CYNTHIA,Do I sit or stand?,865
63321,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497468,u2691,GRAHAM,No.,865
63322,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497467,u2688,CYNTHIA,Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --,865
63323,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497466,u2691,GRAHAM,That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.,865
63324,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497465,u2688,CYNTHIA,How long will it take?,865
63325,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497464,u2691,GRAHAM,Yes.,865
63326,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497463,u2688,CYNTHIA,And you ask questions right?,865
63327,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497462,u2691,GRAHAM,I turn on the camera. You start talking.,865
63328,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497461,u2688,CYNTHIA,How do we start?,865
63329,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497460,u2691,GRAHAM,Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.,865
63330,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497459,u2688,CYNTHIA,Would anybody else see the tape?,865
63331,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497458,u2691,GRAHAM,Yes.,865
63332,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497457,u2688,CYNTHIA,Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?,865
63333,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497456,u2691,GRAHAM,That's all.,865
63334,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497455,u2688,CYNTHIA,And that's all?,865
63335,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497454,u2691,GRAHAM,I just want to ask you questions.,865
63336,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497453,u2688,CYNTHIA,You just want to ask me questions?,865
63337,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497452,u2691,GRAHAM,Nothing.,865
63338,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497451,u2688,CYNTHIA,What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?,865
63339,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497450,u2691,GRAHAM,Sex. Your sexual history your sexual preferences.,865
63340,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497449,u2688,CYNTHIA,About what?,865
63341,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497448,u2691,GRAHAM,Talking.,865
63342,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497447,u2688,CYNTHIA,Doing what?,865
63343,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497446,u2691,GRAHAM,Why don't you let me tape you?,865
63344,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497445,u2688,CYNTHIA,Well either you are or you aren't. Which is it?,865
63345,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497444,u2691,GRAHAM,Not exactly.,865
63346,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497443,u2688,CYNTHIA,Well they must be something sexual because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?,865
63347,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497442,u2691,GRAHAM,What do you get?,865
63348,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497441,u2688,CYNTHIA,Oh okay. I think I get it.,865
63349,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497439,u2691,GRAHAM,Spooked.,865
63350,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497438,u2688,CYNTHIA,I think you're right. So come on I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked tell me what happened.,865
63351,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497437,u2691,GRAHAM,Nope. I think the man is a liar.,865
63352,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497436,u2688,CYNTHIA,Well I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean look at John for crissake. Oh you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.,865
63353,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497435,u2691,GRAHAM,I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.,865
63354,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497434,u2688,CYNTHIA,I uh know a guy at the power company.,865
63355,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497433,u2691,GRAHAM,How did you find me?,865
63356,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497432,u2688,CYNTHIA,Nope.,865
63357,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497431,u2691,GRAHAM,She didn't give you my address?,865
63358,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497430,u2688,CYNTHIA,Nope.,865
63359,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497429,u2691,GRAHAM,She didn't tell you why she was upset?,865
63360,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497428,u2688,CYNTHIA,Nope.,865
63361,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497427,u2691,GRAHAM,And are you here to berate me for making her that way?,865
63362,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497426,u2688,CYNTHIA,She still is.,865
63363,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497425,u2691,GRAHAM,No I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused I would say. And upset.,865
63364,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497424,u2688,CYNTHIA,Well like I said Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.,865
63365,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497423,u2691,GRAHAM,I just want to know why you're here.,865
63366,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497422,u2688,CYNTHIA,You want me to leave?,865
63367,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497421,u2691,GRAHAM,She called you that too. May I ask why you're here?,865
63368,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497420,u2688,CYNTHIA,She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.,865
63369,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497419,u2691,GRAHAM,The extrovert.,865
63370,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497418,u2688,CYNTHIA,I'm Ann Millaney's sister.,865
63371,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497417,u2691,GRAHAM,Do I know you?,865
63372,m175,sex lies and videotape,L497416,u2688,CYNTHIA,I'm Cynthia Bishop.,865

82296,m234,agnes of god,L14149,u3555,MARTHA,I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.,854
82298,m234,agnes of god,L14139,u3555,MARTHA,Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.,854
82300,m234,agnes of god,L13822,u3555,MARTHA,What about Roger? He's free.,854

82308,m234,agnes of god,L14038,u3555,MARTHA,Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?,854
82310,m234,agnes of god,L14036,u3555,MARTHA,I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.,854

82317,m234,agnes of god,L14054,u3555,MARTHA,Uh huh.,854
82319,m234,agnes of god,L14052,u3555,MARTHA,The one up on the third floor?,854
82321,m234,agnes of god,L14050,u3555,MARTHA,Sister Anne which was Agnes' room?,854
82323,m234,agnes of god,L14048,u3555,MARTHA,Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?,854
82325,m234,agnes of god,L14046,u3555,MARTHA,How do you survive?,854
82328,m234,agnes of god,L14308,u3555,MARTHA,I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?,854
82330,m234,agnes of god,L14306,u3555,MARTHA,Look Father ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...,854
82332,m234,agnes of god,L14304,u3555,MARTHA,What business is it of yours..?,854
82334,m234,agnes of god,L14302,u3555,MARTHA,Who told you this?,854
82336,m234,agnes of god,L14300,u3555,MARTHA,What does this have to do with..?,854
82338,m234,agnes of god,L14298,u3555,MARTHA,Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.,854
82340,m234,agnes of god,L14296,u3555,MARTHA,No.,854
82341,m234,agnes of god,L14742,u3555,MARTHA,Wasn't it!,854
82342,m234,agnes of god,L14741,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Oh don't do this!,854
82343,m234,agnes of god,L14737,u3555,MARTHA,What happened to the baby?,854
82344,m234,agnes of god,L14736,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,She can't remember.,854
82345,m234,agnes of god,L14735,u3555,MARTHA,Agnes what happened to the baby?,854
82346,m234,agnes of god,L14734,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,That's enough.,854
82347,m234,agnes of god,L14685,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Then she's a liar.,854
82348,m234,agnes of god,L14684,u3555,MARTHA,I doubt that's what she'd say.,854
82349,m234,agnes of god,L14683,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I left it with her and I went for help.,854
82350,m234,agnes of god,L14682,u3555,MARTHA,Before or after you killed the child?,854
82351,m234,agnes of god,L14681,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them but it was such a difficult birth there was so much blood and I panicked.,854
82352,m234,agnes of god,L14680,u3555,MARTHA,You tied the cord around its neck.,854
82353,m234,agnes of god,L14679,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,No!,854
82354,m234,agnes of god,L14678,u3555,MARTHA,And the baby.,854
82355,m234,agnes of god,L14677,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.,854
82356,m234,agnes of god,L14676,u3555,MARTHA,You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.,854
82357,m234,agnes of god,L14675,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,That's a lie.,854
82358,m234,agnes of god,L14674,u3555,MARTHA,You wanted that child out of the way.,854
82359,m234,agnes of god,L14673,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,She didn't want any help.,854
82360,m234,agnes of god,L14672,u3555,MARTHA,You went to the room to help with the birth.,854
82361,m234,agnes of god,L14671,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,The scandal...,854
82362,m234,agnes of god,L14670,u3555,MARTHA,The baby?,854
82363,m234,agnes of god,L14669,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I don't know... too late to stop it.,854
82364,m234,agnes of god,L14668,u3555,MARTHA,Too late for what?,854
82365,m234,agnes of god,L14667,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Oh don't be ridiculous.,854
82366,m234,agnes of god,L14666,u3555,MARTHA,For what?  An abortion?,854
82367,m234,agnes of god,L14665,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I didn't guess until it was too late.,854
82368,m234,agnes of god,L14664,u3555,MARTHA,And you didn't send her to a doctor.,854
82369,m234,agnes of god,L14663,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Yes.,854
82370,m234,agnes of god,L14662,u3555,MARTHA,Did you know she was pregnant?,854
82371,m234,agnes of god,L14661,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Is it because she's a nun?,854
82372,m234,agnes of god,L14660,u3555,MARTHA,Was it you?,854
82373,m234,agnes of god,L14659,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Why do you insist upon pressing...,854
82374,m234,agnes of god,L14658,u3555,MARTHA,Who knew she was pregnant?,854
82375,m234,agnes of god,L14657,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,My God but you're determined.,854
82376,m234,agnes of god,L14656,u3555,MARTHA,I have a few more questions to ask her.,854
82377,m234,agnes of god,L14655,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Hasn't she had enough?,854
82378,m234,agnes of god,L14654,u3555,MARTHA,Where is she?,854
82379,m234,agnes of god,L14653,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,This is permission to take her apart.,854
82380,m234,agnes of god,L14636,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,If you believe this is murder it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to not me. And definitely not Agnes.,854
82381,m234,agnes of god,L14635,u3555,MARTHA,Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?,854
82382,m234,agnes of god,L14634,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I'm concerned about her health.,854
82383,m234,agnes of god,L14633,u3555,MARTHA,Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.,854
82384,m234,agnes of god,L14632,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Why would I lie?,854
82385,m234,agnes of god,L14631,u3555,MARTHA,Oh would you stop lying Mother!,854
82386,m234,agnes of god,L14630,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.,854
82387,m234,agnes of god,L14629,u3555,MARTHA,Somebody told her.,854
82388,m234,agnes of god,L14628,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,That's crazy. How could she find out about it?,854
82389,m234,agnes of god,L14627,u3555,MARTHA,There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.,854
82390,m234,agnes of god,L14626,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?,854
82391,m234,agnes of god,L14625,u3555,MARTHA,That's what I have to believe...,854
82392,m234,agnes of god,L14624,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?,854
82393,m234,agnes of god,L14623,u3555,MARTHA,But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One two three right down the line.,854
82394,m234,agnes of god,L14622,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,She is an innocent.,854
82395,m234,agnes of god,L14621,u3555,MARTHA,But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.,854
82396,m234,agnes of god,L14620,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.,854
82397,m234,agnes of god,L14619,u3555,MARTHA,I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?,854
82398,m234,agnes of god,L14618,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,You'll never find the answer for everything God did.,854
82399,m234,agnes of god,L14617,u3555,MARTHA,But how did it happen?,854
82400,m234,agnes of god,L14616,u3555,MARTHA,You're saying God did it?,854
82401,m234,agnes of god,L14615,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.,854
82402,m234,agnes of god,L14614,u3555,MARTHA,This is insane.,854
82403,m234,agnes of god,L14613,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?,854
82404,m234,agnes of god,L14612,u3555,MARTHA,Well give me a reasonable explanation,854
82405,m234,agnes of god,L14611,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Don't be ridiculous.,854
82406,m234,agnes of god,L14610,u3555,MARTHA,How  ?,854
82407,m234,agnes of god,L14609,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Stop laughing I don't say it's the truth I'm saying...,854
82408,m234,agnes of god,L14608,u3555,MARTHA,My God you're as crazy as...,854
82409,m234,agnes of god,L14607,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Why must he be anybody?,854
82410,m234,agnes of god,L14606,u3555,MARTHA,Who is he?,854
82411,m234,agnes of god,L14605,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,The father!,854
82412,m234,agnes of god,L14604,u3555,MARTHA,How?  How?  She hallucinates stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.,854
82413,m234,agnes of god,L14603,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,She's been touched by God yes.,854
82414,m234,agnes of god,L14602,u3555,MARTHA,You think she's a saint?,854
82415,m234,agnes of god,L14601,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,For Agnes.,854
82416,m234,agnes of god,L14600,u3555,MARTHA,For the Church?,854
82417,m234,agnes of god,L14599,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.,854
82418,m234,agnes of god,L14598,u3555,MARTHA,One that will ask the questions you want asked.,854
82419,m234,agnes of god,L14597,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own thank you. ,854
82420,m234,agnes of god,L14596,u3555,MARTHA,You're what?,854
82421,m234,agnes of god,L14595,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.,854
82422,m234,agnes of god,L14573,u3555,MARTHA,NO... no... I said leave her alone.,854
82423,m234,agnes of god,L14572,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Stop this she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.,854
82424,m234,agnes of god,L14489,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Then let's begin.,854
82425,m234,agnes of god,L14488,u3555,MARTHA,Of course.,854
82426,m234,agnes of god,L14487,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,May I be present?,854
82427,m234,agnes of god,L14486,u3555,MARTHA,No.,854
82428,m234,agnes of god,L14485,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Would it stop you if I did?,854
82429,m234,agnes of god,L14484,u3555,MARTHA,The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?,854
82430,m234,agnes of god,L14483,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Begin what?,854
82431,m234,agnes of god,L14482,u3555,MARTHA,I'd like to begin.,854
82432,m234,agnes of god,L14481,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Listen to her singing.,854
82433,m234,agnes of god,L14480,u3555,MARTHA,Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?,854
82434,m234,agnes of god,L14479,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Yes but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born we live we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear how I miss the miracles.,854
82435,m234,agnes of god,L14478,u3555,MARTHA,Well you can try can't you to be good?,854
82436,m234,agnes of god,L14477,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Become?  One is born a saint.,854
82437,m234,agnes of god,L14476,u3555,MARTHA,Do you want to become one?,854
82438,m234,agnes of god,L14475,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Yes I do.,854
82439,m234,agnes of god,L14474,u3555,MARTHA,Do you think they ever existed?,854
82440,m234,agnes of god,L14473,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,There are no saints today. Good people yes but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.,854
82441,m234,agnes of god,L14472,u3555,MARTHA,Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?,854
82442,m234,agnes of god,L14471,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,And Saint John would chew tobacco.,854
82443,m234,agnes of god,L14470,u3555,MARTHA,Oh you've come a long way baby.,854
82444,m234,agnes of god,L14469,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Mary Magdelen?,854
82445,m234,agnes of god,L14468,u3555,MARTHA,Right...,854
82446,m234,agnes of god,L14467,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Pipe!,854
82447,m234,agnes of god,L14466,u3555,MARTHA,Saint Peter?,854
82448,m234,agnes of god,L14465,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Even Christ would partake socially.,854
82449,m234,agnes of god,L14464,u3555,MARTHA,Hand rolled.,854
82450,m234,agnes of god,L14463,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course ,854
82451,m234,agnes of god,L14462,u3555,MARTHA,Long thin and filtered.,854
82452,m234,agnes of god,L14461,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but well Saint Thomas More...,854
82453,m234,agnes of god,L14460,u3555,MARTHA,Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?,854
82454,m234,agnes of god,L14459,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Fine thanks...,854
82455,m234,agnes of god,L14458,u3555,MARTHA,All right?,854
82456,m234,agnes of god,L14457,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I'm out of prac...  ... practice. ,854
82457,m234,agnes of god,L14456,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I'd love one.,854
82458,m234,agnes of god,L14455,u3555,MARTHA,Would you like one?  Huh?,854
82459,m234,agnes of god,L14454,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,No it reminds me.,854
82460,m234,agnes of god,L14453,u3555,MARTHA,My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?,854
82461,m234,agnes of god,L14451,u3555,MARTHA,No because I... yeah yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.,854
82462,m234,agnes of god,L14450,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,So you left the Church because you had freckles?,854
82463,m234,agnes of god,L14449,u3555,MARTHA,I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly I was scrawny I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face do you know what the nun called me Sister Mary Clitus called me Polkadot Livingston.,854
82464,m234,agnes of god,L14448,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,And what has that to do with it?,854
82465,m234,agnes of god,L14447,u3555,MARTHA,That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.,854
82466,m234,agnes of god,L14446,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Stupid woman... and that's all?,854
82467,m234,agnes of god,L14445,u3555,MARTHA,It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school you know what the nun said?  She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.,854
82468,m234,agnes of god,L14444,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,What have we done to hurt you?  And don't deny it I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do?  Burn a few heretics sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh?  You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin?,854
82469,m234,agnes of god,L14443,u3555,MARTHA,Nothing...,854
82470,m234,agnes of god,L14442,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?,854
82471,m234,agnes of god,L14441,u3555,MARTHA,You just said...,854
82472,m234,agnes of god,L14440,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Who said anything about the Catholic Church...,854
82473,m234,agnes of god,L14439,u3555,MARTHA,Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...,854
82474,m234,agnes of god,L14438,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Bullshit yourself!,854
82475,m234,agnes of god,L14437,u3555,MARTHA,Bullshit!,854
82476,m234,agnes of god,L14436,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Because I am a moral person.,854
82477,m234,agnes of god,L14435,u3555,MARTHA,Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother huh?,854
82478,m234,agnes of god,L14434,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.,854
82479,m234,agnes of god,L14433,u3555,MARTHA,An unhappy woman...,854
82480,m234,agnes of god,L14431,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I know you don't.,854
82481,m234,agnes of god,L14430,u3555,MARTHA,I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.,854
82482,m234,agnes of god,L14429,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Her spiritual health.,854
82483,m234,agnes of god,L14428,u3555,MARTHA,The woman's health is at stake.,854
82484,m234,agnes of god,L14427,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I haven't decided yet.,854
82485,m234,agnes of god,L14426,u3555,MARTHA,Don't deny it!,854
82486,m234,agnes of god,L14425,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,We'll see about that.,854
82487,m234,agnes of god,L14424,u3555,MARTHA,I'd like yours too.,854
82488,m234,agnes of god,L14423,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,And my permission?,854
82489,m234,agnes of god,L14403,u3555,MARTHA,Oh God.,854
82490,m234,agnes of god,L14402,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Because I didn't know... ,854
82491,m234,agnes of god,L14401,u3555,MARTHA,Why didn't you do anything to stop her?,854
82492,m234,agnes of god,L14400,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I knew that after the fact.,854
82493,m234,agnes of god,L14399,u3555,MARTHA,Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.,854
82494,m234,agnes of god,L14398,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Oh God if only I'd known.,854
82495,m234,agnes of god,L14397,u3555,MARTHA,There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.,854
82496,m234,agnes of god,L14396,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Oh dear God.,854
82497,m234,agnes of god,L14395,u3555,MARTHA,She molested her!,854
82498,m234,agnes of god,L14394,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I don't think I care to know.,854
82499,m234,agnes of god,L14393,u3555,MARTHA,Do you know what she did to her?,854
82500,m234,agnes of god,L14392,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,She drank too much. That's what killed her.,854
82501,m234,agnes of god,L14391,u3555,MARTHA,Listening to angels?,854
82502,m234,agnes of god,L14390,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Yes.,854
82503,m234,agnes of god,L14389,u3555,MARTHA,Like keeping her home from school?,854
82504,m234,agnes of god,L14387,u3555,MARTHA,And Agnes' father?,854
82505,m234,agnes of god,L14386,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.,854
82506,m234,agnes of god,L14385,u3555,MARTHA,No it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?,854
82507,m234,agnes of god,L14384,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.,854
82508,m234,agnes of god,L14383,u3555,MARTHA,Your niece!,854
82509,m234,agnes of god,L14382,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,About what?,854
82510,m234,agnes of god,L14381,u3555,MARTHA,You lied to me,854
82511,m234,agnes of god,L14295,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.,854
82512,m234,agnes of god,L14294,u3555,MARTHA,Sister Paul?,854
82513,m234,agnes of god,L14293,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.,854
82514,m234,agnes of god,L14292,u3555,MARTHA,When was that?,854
82515,m234,agnes of god,L14265,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Oh Dear God I should have guessed...,854
82516,m234,agnes of god,L14264,u3555,MARTHA,What sheets?,854
82517,m234,agnes of god,L14263,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,The sheets...,854
82518,m234,agnes of god,L14262,u3555,MARTHA,What is it?,854
82519,m234,agnes of god,L14261,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Oh Dear God...,854
82520,m234,agnes of god,L14260,u3555,MARTHA,Was the child full term?,854
82521,m234,agnes of god,L14259,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,There's nothing here.,854
82522,m234,agnes of god,L14258,u3555,MARTHA,Take at look at it.,854
82523,m234,agnes of god,L14257,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Yes.,854
82524,m234,agnes of god,L14256,u3555,MARTHA,Do you have a... a diary or a day book?,854
82525,m234,agnes of god,L14255,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Nothing.,854

82527,m234,agnes of god,L14253,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Earthquakes?,854
82528,m234,agnes of god,L14252,u3555,MARTHA,Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?,854
82529,m234,agnes of god,L14251,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Oh some time in January.,854
82530,m234,agnes of god,L14250,u3555,MARTHA,When would Agnes have conceived the child?,854
82531,m234,agnes of god,L14249,u3555,MARTHA,Answers.,854
82532,m234,agnes of god,L14248,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,All right what do you need.,854
82533,m234,agnes of god,L14247,u3555,MARTHA,Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.,854
82534,m234,agnes of god,L14246,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,How?,854
82535,m234,agnes of god,L14245,u3555,MARTHA,Aquittal.,854
82536,m234,agnes of god,L14244,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,What?,854
82537,m234,agnes of god,L14243,u3555,MARTHA,There's another choice.,854
82538,m234,agnes of god,L14242,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.,854
82539,m234,agnes of god,L14241,u3555,MARTHA,No you're shielding her. Let her face the world.,854
82540,m234,agnes of god,L14240,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I am...,854
82541,m234,agnes of god,L14239,u3555,MARTHA,Then help her.,854
82542,m234,agnes of god,L14238,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I am not a virgin Doctor. I was married for twenty three years two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. ,854
82543,m234,agnes of god,L14237,u3555,MARTHA,???   ... virginity right Mother?  Poverty chastity and ignorance is what you live by.,854
82544,m234,agnes of god,L14236,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,???  ,854
82545,m234,agnes of god,L14235,u3555,MARTHA,And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...,854
82546,m234,agnes of god,L14234,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,She is not a child.,854
82547,m234,agnes of god,L14233,u3555,MARTHA,... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.,854
82548,m234,agnes of god,L14232,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I'm only interested...,854
82549,m234,agnes of god,L14231,u3555,MARTHA,How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...,854
82550,m234,agnes of god,L14230,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,It's my affair too.,854
82551,m234,agnes of god,L14229,u3555,MARTHA,How dare you tell me to run my affairs!,854
82552,m234,agnes of god,L14228,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...,854
82553,m234,agnes of god,L14227,u3555,MARTHA,I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.,854
82554,m234,agnes of god,L14226,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,The Catholic Church...,854
82555,m234,agnes of god,L14225,u3555,MARTHA,I hate ignorance and stupidity.,854
82556,m234,agnes of god,L14224,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Nuns... you hate nuns.,854
82557,m234,agnes of god,L14223,u3555,MARTHA,What?,854
82558,m234,agnes of god,L14222,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,You hate us don't you?,854
82559,m234,agnes of god,L14129,u3555,MARTHA,And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?,854
82560,m234,agnes of god,L14128,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.,854
82561,m234,agnes of god,L14127,u3555,MARTHA,It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique she's just another victim.,854
82562,m234,agnes of god,L14126,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?,854
82563,m234,agnes of god,L14125,u3555,MARTHA,Not simple no.,854
82564,m234,agnes of god,L14124,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I know what you're thinking she's a hysteric pure and simple.,854
82565,m234,agnes of god,L14123,u3555,MARTHA,She has it now.,854
82566,m234,agnes of god,L14122,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen psychiatrists ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.,854
82567,m234,agnes of god,L14121,u3555,MARTHA,She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.,854
82568,m234,agnes of god,L14120,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...,854
82569,m234,agnes of god,L14119,u3555,MARTHA,Why didn't you take her to a doctor?,854
82570,m234,agnes of god,L14065,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,About two years before.,854
82571,m234,agnes of god,L14064,u3555,MARTHA,This was before her pregnancy?,854
82572,m234,agnes of god,L14063,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,She stopped eating completely...,854
82573,m234,agnes of god,L14062,u3555,MARTHA,And what happened?,854
82574,m234,agnes of god,L14061,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I was appalled just as you are now.,854
82575,m234,agnes of god,L14060,u3555,MARTHA,And you weren't shocked?,854
82576,m234,agnes of god,L14059,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Shortly after she came to us.,854
82577,m234,agnes of god,L14058,u3555,MARTHA,When did you first learn about her... innocence the way she thinks?,854
82578,m234,agnes of god,L14057,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Oh come on you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born let alone made.,854
82579,m234,agnes of god,L14056,u3555,MARTHA,Well it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.,854
82580,m234,agnes of god,L14055,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.,854
82581,m234,agnes of god,L14020,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.,854
82582,m234,agnes of god,L14019,u3555,MARTHA,That possibility never occurred to you?,854
82583,m234,agnes of god,L14018,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,That's absurd!,854
82584,m234,agnes of god,L14017,u3555,MARTHA,One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.,854
82585,m234,agnes of god,L14016,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Who?,854
82586,m234,agnes of god,L14015,u3555,MARTHA,It's possible isn't it?,854
82587,m234,agnes of god,L14014,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,You don't really believe something like that happened do you?,854
82588,m234,agnes of god,L14013,u3555,MARTHA,That she was unconscious yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...,854
82589,m234,agnes of god,L14012,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I've already told you what I thought.,854
82590,m234,agnes of god,L14011,u3555,MARTHA,And in your eyes?,854
82591,m234,agnes of god,L14010,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,No... not in the eyes of the police.,854
82592,m234,agnes of god,L14009,u3555,MARTHA,So someone else could have done it.,854
82593,m234,agnes of god,L14008,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,She didn't!  This is manslaughter not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.,854
82594,m234,agnes of god,L14007,u3555,MARTHA,If she's so innocent how come she murdered a child?,854
82595,m234,agnes of god,L14006,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.,854
82596,m234,agnes of god,L14005,u3555,MARTHA,That's ridiculous...,854
82597,m234,agnes of god,L14004,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.,854
82598,m234,agnes of god,L14003,u3555,MARTHA,How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?,854
82599,m234,agnes of god,L14002,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,From other people!  I believe she is not crazy nor is she lying.,854
82600,m234,agnes of god,L14001,u3555,MARTHA,From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.,854
82601,m234,agnes of god,L14000,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,I believe Agnes is different.,854
82602,m234,agnes of god,L13999,u3555,MARTHA,What's your opinion?,854
82603,m234,agnes of god,L13998,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.,854
82604,m234,agnes of god,L13883,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are!  I don't want that mind cut open.,854
82605,m234,agnes of god,L13882,u3555,MARTHA,I am not with the Inquisition.,854
82606,m234,agnes of god,L13881,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.,854
82607,m234,agnes of god,L13880,u3555,MARTHA,The science of psychiatry.,854
82608,m234,agnes of god,L13879,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Look doctor I don't know how to tell you this politely but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...,854
82609,m234,agnes of god,L13878,u3555,MARTHA,Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is or is not important here.,854
82610,m234,agnes of god,L13877,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Don't ask me those questions dear I'm not the patient.,854
82611,m234,agnes of god,L13876,u3555,MARTHA,Why do you think that?,854
82612,m234,agnes of god,L13875,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Yes but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.,854
82613,m234,agnes of god,L13874,u3555,MARTHA,Look someone gave her the baby.,854
82614,m234,agnes of god,L13873,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?,854
82615,m234,agnes of god,L13872,u3555,MARTHA,Why haven't you asked her?,854
82616,m234,agnes of god,L13871,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Believe me I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.,854
82617,m234,agnes of god,L13870,u3555,MARTHA,And you didn't try to find out who?,854
82618,m234,agnes of god,L13869,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Obviously there was.,854
82619,m234,agnes of god,L13868,u3555,MARTHA,Could there have been anyone else?,854
82620,m234,agnes of god,L13867,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Father Martineau but I don't see him as a candidate.,854
82621,m234,agnes of god,L13866,u3555,MARTHA,What's his name?,854
82622,m234,agnes of god,L13865,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,Yes but I...,854
82623,m234,agnes of god,L13864,u3555,MARTHA,Was there a priest?,854
82624,m234,agnes of god,L13863,u3557,MOTHER MIRIAM,None as far as I know.,854

100074,m285,broadcast news,L113841,u4268,AARON,What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around?  Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long red pointy tail.  No.  I'm semi-serious here.  He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.  And he'll get all the great women.,720
100075,m285,broadcast news,L113840,u4278,JANE,This isn't friendship.,720
100076,m285,broadcast news,L113839,u4268,AARON,I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom while a very nice guy is the Devil.,720
100077,m285,broadcast news,L113838,u4278,JANE,Yeah -- being a basket case.,720
100078,m285,broadcast news,L113837,u4268,AARON,You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.,720
100079,m285,broadcast news,L113836,u4278,JANE,Yes I guess.  Yes.,720
100080,m285,broadcast news,L113835,u4268,AARON,Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?,720
100081,m285,broadcast news,L113834,u4268,AARON,Let me think a second.  It's tough.,720
100082,m285,broadcast news,L113833,u4278,JANE,What?,720
100083,m285,broadcast news,L113832,u4268,AARON,Yeah.  Well...I think it is important for you too.  Sit down.,720
100084,m285,broadcast news,L113831,u4278,JANE,This is important to me.,720

100088,m285,broadcast news,L113827,u4268,AARON,Call him -- I mean it can wait right?,720
100089,m285,broadcast news,L113826,u4278,JANE,I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.,720
100090,m285,broadcast news,L113825,u4278,JANE,I have to be somewhere.,720
100091,m285,broadcast news,L113824,u4268,AARON,I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?,720
100092,m285,broadcast news,L113823,u4278,JANE,If all that happened how come you're so chipper?,720
100093,m285,broadcast news,L113822,u4268,AARON,No nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.,720
100094,m285,broadcast news,L113821,u4278,JANE,There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?,720
100095,m285,broadcast news,L113820,u4268,AARON,I'm not kidding.,720
100096,m285,broadcast news,L113819,u4278,JANE,Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.,720
100097,m285,broadcast news,L113818,u4268,AARON,People phoned in.,720
100098,m285,broadcast news,L113817,u4278,JANE,What do you mean flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...,720
100099,m285,broadcast news,L113816,u4268,AARON,It was great...writing my little first rate copy sitting on my jacket punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?,720
100100,m285,broadcast news,L113815,u4278,JANE,Aaron will you tell me?,720
100101,m285,broadcast news,L113814,u4268,AARON,I lost six pounds...,720

100107,m285,broadcast news,L113808,u4268,AARON,Define your terms.,720
100108,m285,broadcast news,L113807,u4278,JANE,Did it really go well?,720
100109,m285,broadcast news,L113806,u4268,AARON,Then it went well.,720
100110,m285,broadcast news,L113805,u4278,JANE,No.,720
100111,m285,broadcast news,L113804,u4268,AARON,You didn't see it or speak to anybody?,720
100112,m285,broadcast news,L113803,u4278,JANE,How'd it go?,720
100113,m285,broadcast news,L113724,u4278,JANE,You too.,720

100119,m285,broadcast news,L113718,u4278,JANE,Well the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.,720
100120,m285,broadcast news,L113717,u4268,AARON,Yes.,720
100121,m285,broadcast news,L113716,u4278,JANE,As good as humanly possible.,720
100122,m285,broadcast news,L113715,u4268,AARON,Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...,720
100123,m285,broadcast news,L113711,u4278,JANE,It's not a date.  It's co-workers going to a professional conclave.,720
100124,m285,broadcast news,L113710,u4268,AARON,Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.,720
100125,m285,broadcast news,L113709,u4278,JANE,I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...,720
100126,m285,broadcast news,L113707,u4268,AARON,Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?,720
100127,m285,broadcast news,L113706,u4278,JANE,Did you bring your grey suit?,720
100128,m285,broadcast news,L113705,u4268,AARON,I didn't know you were going with him.,720
100129,m285,broadcast news,L113704,u4278,JANE,Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...,720
100130,m285,broadcast news,L113548,u4268,AARON,They're not that dumb after all.,720

100137,m285,broadcast news,L113511,u4278,JANE,You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.,720
100138,m285,broadcast news,L113510,u4268,AARON,Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway well why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but Jane I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.,720
100139,m285,broadcast news,L113509,u4278,JANE,Sounds like you may be on to something.,720
100140,m285,broadcast news,L113508,u4268,AARON,I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well they'll pay me more treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.,720
100141,m285,broadcast news,L113507,u4278,JANE,Well whatever you think.,720
100142,m285,broadcast news,L113466,u4268,AARON,You're welcome.  Sow how does it feel to...I know you gotta go -- Me too.  We're very busy here.,720
100143,m285,broadcast news,L113465,u4278,JANE,Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.,720
100144,m285,broadcast news,L113464,u4268,AARON,Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive self-control...that's what's so strange.,720
100145,m285,broadcast news,L113459,u4278,JANE,Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.,720
100146,m285,broadcast news,L113458,u4268,AARON,I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.,720
100147,m285,broadcast news,L113412,u4278,JANE,I'll come by your place right after...drink take pills... Love you.,720

100151,m285,broadcast news,L113337,u4268,AARON,Not because you have to.,720
100152,m285,broadcast news,L113336,u4278,JANE,I write for you sometimes.,720
100153,m285,broadcast news,L113205,u4268,AARON,Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.,720
100154,m285,broadcast news,L113204,u4278,JANE,To the pan of the supplies boxes --,720
100155,m285,broadcast news,L113203,u4268,AARON,We can cut back at the end.,720
100156,m285,broadcast news,L113202,u4278,JANE,Of course.,720
100157,m285,broadcast news,L113201,u4268,AARON,Did you shoot their boots?,720
100158,m285,broadcast news,L113200,u4278,JANE,Okay.  Great line at the end.,720
100159,m285,broadcast news,L113188,u4278,JANE,You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.,720
100160,m285,broadcast news,L113187,u4268,AARON,Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.,720
100161,m285,broadcast news,L113186,u4278,JANE,If we don't get to their camp soon we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.,720
100162,m285,broadcast news,L113185,u4268,AARON,I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.,720
100163,m285,broadcast news,L113157,u4278,JANE,Oh God.  Back it Bobbie -- Bobbie?,720

100166,m285,broadcast news,L113106,u4278,JANE,You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?,720
100167,m285,broadcast news,L113105,u4268,AARON,They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.,720
100168,m285,broadcast news,L113099,u4278,JANE,Call if you get weird.,720
100169,m285,broadcast news,L113098,u4268,AARON,Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?,720
100170,m285,broadcast news,L113097,u4278,JANE,Good night.,720
100171,m285,broadcast news,L113096,u4268,AARON,I'd give anything if that were true.,720
100172,m285,broadcast news,L113095,u4278,JANE,This conversation is not worthy of you.,720
100173,m285,broadcast news,L113094,u4268,AARON,Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?,720
100174,m285,broadcast news,L113093,u4278,JANE,Sure.,720
100175,m285,broadcast news,L113092,u4268,AARON,Okay.  Let's do me.,720
100176,m285,broadcast news,L113091,u4268,AARON,Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.,720
100177,m285,broadcast news,L113090,u4278,JANE,Why do you say that?,720
100178,m285,broadcast news,L113089,u4268,AARON,He must have been great-looking right?,720
100179,m285,broadcast news,L113019,u4278,JANE,No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.,720
100180,m285,broadcast news,L113018,u4268,AARON,Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.,720
100181,m285,broadcast news,L112996,u4268,AARON,Okay I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].,720

100183,m285,broadcast news,L112994,u4268,AARON,Now listen Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria they gonna furnish tastefully.,720
100184,m285,broadcast news,L112993,u4278,JANE,At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.,720

100186,m285,broadcast news,L113007,u4268,AARON,In other times with other purposes there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war.  But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money.,720
100188,m285,broadcast news,L113005,u4268,AARON,Oh you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.,720

100208,m285,broadcast news,L113667,u4268,AARON,Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.,720
100210,m285,broadcast news,L113665,u4268,AARON,Ah damn -- the fucking jerks -- My God.  They want to fire me.,720
100212,m285,broadcast news,L113663,u4268,AARON,Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.,720

100233,m285,broadcast news,L113016,u4268,AARON,It depends on how big a news day it is.,720
100235,m285,broadcast news,L113014,u4268,AARON,How long has it been since you've been home.,720

100241,m285,broadcast news,L113360,u4268,AARON,No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.,720
100243,m285,broadcast news,L113358,u4268,AARON,Take care Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.,720

100391,m285,broadcast news,L113402,u4278,JANE,Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.,720
100392,m285,broadcast news,L114086,u4281,TOM,Okay...It's so good to see you.,720

100396,m285,broadcast news,L114082,u4281,TOM,What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.,720
100397,m285,broadcast news,L114075,u4278,JANE,I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you?  You're more adorable than your pictures.  Look what I got for you.,720
100398,m285,broadcast news,L114074,u4281,TOM,A picnic?,720

100402,m285,broadcast news,L114047,u4278,JANE,It's better when you let me say it.,720
100403,m285,broadcast news,L114046,u4281,TOM,Then you should stay here.,720
100404,m285,broadcast news,L114045,u4278,JANE,It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs that...,720
100405,m285,broadcast news,L114044,u4281,TOM,You want to come?,720
100406,m285,broadcast news,L114043,u4278,JANE,So you have an extra bathing suit huh?,720
100407,m285,broadcast news,L114041,u4278,JANE,It's okay.,720
100408,m285,broadcast news,L114040,u4281,TOM,Yes I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.,720
100409,m285,broadcast news,L114039,u4278,JANE,You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...,720
100410,m285,broadcast news,L114038,u4281,TOM,What I don't know I can learn and what I know nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.,720
100411,m285,broadcast news,L114037,u4278,JANE,I knew what you meant.,720
100412,m285,broadcast news,L114036,u4281,TOM,Well let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.,720

100415,m285,broadcast news,L114033,u4278,JANE,That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.,720
100416,m285,broadcast news,L114031,u4281,TOM,I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.,720
100417,m285,broadcast news,L114030,u4278,JANE,It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...,720
100418,m285,broadcast news,L114029,u4281,TOM,This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.,720
100419,m285,broadcast news,L114028,u4278,JANE,It just proves that the difference we have are...,720
100420,m285,broadcast news,L114027,u4281,TOM,It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker don't they?,720

100423,m285,broadcast news,L114024,u4278,JANE,It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.,720
100424,m285,broadcast news,L114023,u4281,TOM,Jane Jane Jane Jane Jane...,720
100425,m285,broadcast news,L114022,u4278,JANE,Jesus if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...,720
100426,m285,broadcast news,L114021,u4281,TOM,We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?,720
100427,m285,broadcast news,L114020,u4278,JANE,Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.,720
100428,m285,broadcast news,L114019,u4281,TOM,I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?,720
100429,m285,broadcast news,L114018,u4278,JANE,I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.,720
100430,m285,broadcast news,L114017,u4281,TOM,Why?,720
100431,m285,broadcast news,L114013,u4278,JANE,You fucking...,720

100433,m285,broadcast news,L113975,u4278,JANE,That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.',720
100434,m285,broadcast news,L113974,u4281,TOM,That's yes?,720
100435,m285,broadcast news,L113973,u4278,JANE,Well I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.,720
100436,m285,broadcast news,L113972,u4281,TOM,Sorry.  I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse.  This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job.  I have a week to get to my job.  Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this.,720
100437,m285,broadcast news,L113971,u4278,JANE,How can you say that to me?,720
100438,m285,broadcast news,L113970,u4281,TOM,Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But hey congratulations on the promotion.,720
100439,m285,broadcast news,L113930,u4278,JANE,That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint...  Whooo.,720
100440,m285,broadcast news,L113929,u4281,TOM,That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.,720

100442,m285,broadcast news,L113927,u4281,TOM,Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...,720
100443,m285,broadcast news,L113926,u4278,JANE,No.  Did he really?,720
100444,m285,broadcast news,L113925,u4281,TOM,He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.,720
100445,m285,broadcast news,L113924,u4278,JANE,I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?,720
100446,m285,broadcast news,L113877,u4278,JANE,Okay great Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.,720

100455,m285,broadcast news,L113868,u4278,JANE,I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.,720
100456,m285,broadcast news,L113867,u4281,TOM,No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.,720

100468,m285,broadcast news,L113799,u4278,JANE,He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?,720
100469,m285,broadcast news,L113798,u4281,TOM,Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.,720
100470,m285,broadcast news,L113797,u4278,JANE,What happened?,720

100498,m285,broadcast news,L113648,u4278,JANE,It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?,720
100499,m285,broadcast news,L113647,u4281,TOM,So what did you think?,720

100510,m285,broadcast news,L113623,u4281,TOM,What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.,720

100522,m285,broadcast news,L113606,u4281,TOM,Believe me I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.,720
100523,m285,broadcast news,L113605,u4278,JANE,Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?,720
100524,m285,broadcast news,L113604,u4281,TOM,I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.,720
100525,m285,broadcast news,L113603,u4281,TOM,Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...,720

100527,m285,broadcast news,L113601,u4281,TOM,Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?,720
100528,m285,broadcast news,L113558,u4278,JANE,I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...,720
100529,m285,broadcast news,L113557,u4281,TOM,Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?,720
100530,m285,broadcast news,L113556,u4278,JANE,It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.,720
100531,m285,broadcast news,L113555,u4278,JANE,I'll be the judge of that.,720
100532,m285,broadcast news,L113554,u4281,TOM,I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.,720
100533,m285,broadcast news,L113553,u4278,JANE,Come on I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.,720
100534,m285,broadcast news,L113527,u4278,JANE,Hey I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.,720

100536,m285,broadcast news,L113525,u4278,JANE,Well I'll go in and have a bite.,720

100538,m285,broadcast news,L113523,u4278,JANE,Well I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.,720
100539,m285,broadcast news,L113522,u4281,TOM,I didn't think you'd make it.,720

100544,m285,broadcast news,L113495,u4278,JANE,I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?,720
100545,m285,broadcast news,L113494,u4281,TOM,You have to celebrate with me don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner 'Caps.',720
100546,m285,broadcast news,L113493,u4281,TOM,Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing just a split second before I needed it.  There was a rhythm we got into like great sex.,720

100548,m285,broadcast news,L113491,u4281,TOM,You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.,720

100575,m285,broadcast news,L113182,u4278,JANE,I can't help you sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.,720
100576,m285,broadcast news,L113181,u4281,TOM,You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I can pick your brain --,720

100588,m285,broadcast news,L113085,u4278,JANE,Just what do you want from me anyway? Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining and do something about it.,720
100589,m285,broadcast news,L113084,u4281,TOM,Whoa this was a mistake.,720
100590,m285,broadcast news,L113083,u4278,JANE,I agree with you -- you're not qualified.  So get qualified.  You can insist on being better prepared.  You don't have to just leave it as...  'I don't write.  I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it folks.',720
100591,m285,broadcast news,L113082,u4281,TOM,Uh-huh.,720
100592,m285,broadcast news,L113081,u4278,JANE,It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.,720
100593,m285,broadcast news,L113079,u4278,JANE,So you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.,720
100594,m285,broadcast news,L113078,u4281,TOM,One year...almost one year.,720
100595,m285,broadcast news,L113077,u4278,JANE,Well come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?,720
100596,m285,broadcast news,L113076,u4281,TOM,But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.,720
100597,m285,broadcast news,L113075,u4281,TOM,I don't write.,720
100598,m285,broadcast news,L113074,u4278,JANE,What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.,720
100599,m285,broadcast news,L113073,u4281,TOM,I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...,720

100601,m285,broadcast news,L113071,u4281,TOM,Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me I stink.,720
100602,m285,broadcast news,L113069,u4278,JANE,How are you at back rubs?,720
100603,m285,broadcast news,L113068,u4281,TOM,Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.,720
100604,m285,broadcast news,L113067,u4278,JANE,So great -- right?,720
100605,m285,broadcast news,L113066,u4278,JANE,I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.,720
100606,m285,broadcast news,L113065,u4281,TOM,No I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.,720
100607,m285,broadcast news,L113064,u4278,JANE,Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.,720
100608,m285,broadcast news,L113063,u4281,TOM,Yes sure.,720
100609,m285,broadcast news,L113062,u4278,JANE,Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?,720
100610,m285,broadcast news,L113061,u4281,TOM,That actually goes on...,720
100611,m285,broadcast news,L113056,u4278,JANE,Nooo.  If I could just have a roll I'd be okay.,720
100612,m285,broadcast news,L113055,u4281,TOM,Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.,720
100613,m285,broadcast news,L113054,u4278,JANE,If we could just eat first.,720
100614,m285,broadcast news,L113052,u4281,TOM,I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to.  I have about two thousand questions for you.,720
100615,m285,broadcast news,L113050,u4281,TOM,I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?,720
100616,m285,broadcast news,L113049,u4281,TOM,I was a lot earlier.,720
100617,m285,broadcast news,L113048,u4278,JANE,Hi.  I was worried I was early.,720
100618,m285,broadcast news,L113046,u4281,TOM,Well they say if you can reach even one person it means something... And you did that.,720
100619,m285,broadcast news,L113045,u4278,JANE,Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.,720

100626,m285,broadcast news,L113366,u4278,JANE,God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?,720
100628,m285,broadcast news,L113364,u4278,JANE,Go ahead -- what?,720
100630,m285,broadcast news,L113541,u4281,TOM,I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.,720
100633,m285,broadcast news,L113538,u4281,TOM,Where's the bathroom?,720
100634,m285,broadcast news,L113535,u4281,TOM,It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.,720
100637,m285,broadcast news,L113313,u4281,TOM,This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?,720
100639,m285,broadcast news,L113311,u4281,TOM,Look I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.,720

100642,m285,broadcast news,L114005,u4281,TOM,...that way we have someplace to go when we cut.  And I just sit here I nod my head and look nerdy.,720
100644,m285,broadcast news,L114003,u4281,TOM,I just need you for another minute now so we can shoot from behind towards me and um...,720

102490,m289,casino,L120898,u4331,ACE,Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.,1530
102491,m289,casino,L120889,u4331,ACE,Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi go after the skim go after everything and everybody.,1530

102510,m289,casino,L120870,u4331,ACE,Listen I would -,1530
102511,m289,casino,L120869,u4359,NICKY,No I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.,1530
102512,m289,casino,L120868,u4331,ACE,All of a sudden you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?,1530
102513,m289,casino,L120867,u4359,NICKY,Well she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.,1530
102514,m289,casino,L120866,u4331,ACE,Now what does she have to do with all this?,1530

102530,m289,casino,L120850,u4331,ACE,Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.,1530

102533,m289,casino,L120847,u4359,NICKY,Well back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.,1530
102534,m289,casino,L120846,u4331,ACE,I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.,1530
102535,m289,casino,L120845,u4359,NICKY,Yeah that's out of context. Okay.,1530
102536,m289,casino,L120844,u4331,ACE,That's all taken out of context. Okay.,1530
102537,m289,casino,L120843,u4359,NICKY,You mean quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?,1530
102538,m289,casino,L120842,u4331,ACE,...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.,1530
102539,m289,casino,L120841,u4359,NICKY,Fine.,1530
102540,m289,casino,L120840,u4331,ACE,I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...,1530
102541,m289,casino,L120839,u4359,NICKY,All right fine.,1530
102542,m289,casino,L120838,u4331,ACE,I'll be honest with you.,1530
102543,m289,casino,L120837,u4359,NICKY,Just say so.,1530
102544,m289,casino,L120836,u4331,ACE,I don't wanna come along with you.,1530
102545,m289,casino,L120835,u4359,NICKY,You should say so.,1530
102546,m289,casino,L120834,u4331,ACE,No I don't wanna come -,1530
102547,m289,casino,L120833,u4359,NICKY,Yeah forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know I don't know what it is Sammy but the more I talk to you the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me is that it?,1530
102548,m289,casino,L120832,u4331,ACE,Listen Nick you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over I'm gonna tell you it's all over if I don't get that license.  And believe me if it goes bad for me it's gonna go bad for a lot of people you understand?,1530
102549,m289,casino,L120831,u4359,NICKY,Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me Sammy you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.,1530
102550,m289,casino,L120830,u4331,ACE,I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?,1530
102551,m289,casino,L120829,u4359,NICKY,Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.,1530
102552,m289,casino,L120828,u4331,ACE,What're you doin'? He's a square guy for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.,1530
102553,m289,casino,L120827,u4359,NICKY,You think he got the point?,1530
102554,m289,casino,L120810,u4331,ACE,Hey.,1530
102555,m289,casino,L120809,u4359,NICKY,Hey Ace.,1530
102556,m289,casino,L120796,u4359,NICKY,Well it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.,1530
102557,m289,casino,L120795,u4331,ACE,...very difficult to get in.,1530
102558,m289,casino,L120794,u4331,ACE,It's impossible. It's booked up and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...,1530
102559,m289,casino,L120793,u4359,NICKY,No no it's okay.,1530
102560,m289,casino,L120787,u4359,NICKY,Listen...,1530
102561,m289,casino,L120786,u4331,ACE,Hello.,1530
102562,m289,casino,L120461,u4359,NICKY,Here let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter right not a lot?,1530
102563,m289,casino,L120460,u4331,ACE,- no matter where he was or what he was doing he always went home to make breakfast for his son Nicky- Boy.,1530
102564,m289,casino,L120412,u4359,NICKY,Hey Rich.,1530
102565,m289,casino,L120411,u4331,ACE,Yeah Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years he always made money with them.,1530
102566,m289,casino,L120327,u4359,NICKY,I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.,1530
102567,m289,casino,L120326,u4331,ACE,It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.,1530
102568,m289,casino,L120325,u4331,ACE,In so many words yes.,1530
102569,m289,casino,L120324,u4359,NICKY,In other words I'm fucked.,1530
102570,m289,casino,L120323,u4331,ACE,Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.,1530
102571,m289,casino,L120322,u4359,NICKY,Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?,1530
102572,m289,casino,L120321,u4331,ACE,Nope there's no way.,1530
102573,m289,casino,L120320,u4359,NICKY,Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?,1530
102574,m289,casino,L120318,u4331,ACE,Yeah I believe it. You got banned.,1530
102575,m289,casino,L120317,u4359,NICKY,' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?,1530
102576,m289,casino,L120316,u4359,NICKY,What the fuck is that supposed to mean?,1530
102577,m289,casino,L120315,u4331,ACE,Well it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas and from then on I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas or even near it.,1530
102578,m289,casino,L120255,u4359,NICKY,All right.,1530
102579,m289,casino,L120254,u4331,ACE,I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.,1530
102580,m289,casino,L120253,u4359,NICKY,What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin' that's all.,1530
102581,m289,casino,L120252,u4331,ACE,Bullshit or no bullshit they put you in that book you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.,1530
102582,m289,casino,L120251,u4359,NICKY,That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.,1530
102583,m289,casino,L120250,u4331,ACE,I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.,1530
102584,m289,casino,L120249,u4359,NICKY,Why somebody's complaining?,1530
102585,m289,casino,L120248,u4331,ACE,You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.,1530
102586,m289,casino,L120244,u4331,ACE,Between...,1530
102587,m289,casino,L120243,u4359,NICKY,Hey I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit so why not take advantage right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well within a few years by doin' all of this he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.,1530
102588,m289,casino,L120224,u4331,ACE,You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?,1530
102589,m289,casino,L120223,u4359,NICKY,But I'll tell you he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.,1530
102590,m289,casino,L120219,u4359,NICKY,Thanks pal.,1530
102591,m289,casino,L120218,u4331,ACE,Okay.,1530
102592,m289,casino,L120217,u4359,NICKY,All right Ace?,1530
102593,m289,casino,L120216,u4359,NICKY,I'm sorry about this. Really.,1530
102594,m289,casino,L120215,u4331,ACE,If he does it again he's out for good. I don't care what it is Nick I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.,1530
102595,m289,casino,L120200,u4359,NICKY,What? Ho-  Hey come here.,1530
102596,m289,casino,L120199,u4331,ACE,So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.,1530
102597,m289,casino,L120198,u4331,ACE,Then he called me a faggot.,1530
102598,m289,casino,L120197,u4359,NICKY,What?,1530
102599,m289,casino,L120196,u4331,ACE,...and he tells me to go fuck myself.,1530
102600,m289,casino,L120195,u4331,ACE,He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...,1530
102601,m289,casino,L120194,u4359,NICKY,No.,1530
102602,m289,casino,L120193,u4331,ACE,No I didn't know that. But you know what he did?,1530
102603,m289,casino,L120167,u4331,ACE,You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.,1530
102604,m289,casino,L120166,u4359,NICKY,So I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?,1530
102605,m289,casino,L120165,u4331,ACE,Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.,1530
102606,m289,casino,L120164,u4331,ACE,I mean Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.,1530
102607,m289,casino,L120158,u4359,NICKY,Four aces Doc.,1530
102608,m289,casino,L120157,u4331,ACE,And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.,1530
102609,m289,casino,L120149,u4331,ACE,It was so obvious. I mean all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics they were real signal happy.,1530
102610,m289,casino,L120148,u4359,NICKY,...the next thing I did I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.,1530
102611,m289,casino,L120143,u4359,NICKY,To begin I put money out on the streets chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.,1530
102612,m289,casino,L120142,u4331,ACE,...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.,1530
102613,m289,casino,L120066,u4359,NICKY,It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -,1530
102614,m289,casino,L120065,u4331,ACE,When I married Ginger I knew all the stories but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein' I said. 'I can change her.',1530
102615,m289,casino,L119946,u4359,NICKY,Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah right I'm sure.,1530
102616,m289,casino,L119945,u4331,ACE,Especially at the casino where he definitely did not work people got the message.,1530
102617,m289,casino,L119944,u4331,ACE,And Nicky being Nicky he made his presence known.,1530
102618,m289,casino,L119943,u4359,NICKY,Ohh!,1530
102619,m289,casino,L119908,u4331,ACE,Yeah he had a fool-proof scheme all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won he collected. When he lost he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.,1530
102620,m289,casino,L119907,u4359,NICKY,But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean they had bookies pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So I started getting everybody in line. Best of all for the first time in my life I figured out a way not to lose.,1530

102674,m289,casino,L120662,u4331,ACE,I'm sorry but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or forgive me for saying this he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way I cannot have a man like that workin' here.,1530

123772,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199242,u5161,FRANK,Yeah and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.,1051
123773,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199241,u5164,JACK,You always threw up.,1051
123774,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199240,u5161,FRANK,I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?,1051
123775,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199239,u5164,JACK,Yeah.,1051
123776,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199238,u5161,FRANK,God the old man would've loved this view wouldn't he?,1051
123777,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199237,u5164,JACK,I told you.  It's a useless talent.,1051
123778,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199236,u5161,FRANK,Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes you know that?  Otherwise I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?,1051
123779,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199235,u5164,JACK,They were simple songs.,1051
123780,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199234,u5161,FRANK,Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...,1051
123781,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199233,u5164,JACK,A useless talent.,1051
123782,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199232,u5161,FRANK,Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.,1051
123783,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199231,u5164,JACK,April.,1051
123784,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199230,u5161,FRANK,February?,1051
123785,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199229,u5164,JACK,Couple years.,1051
123786,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199228,u5161,FRANK,Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?,1051
123787,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199227,u5164,JACK,The Royal.,1051
123788,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199224,u5161,FRANK,A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager Mr. Daniels.  We dear brother are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.,1051
123789,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199223,u5164,JACK,Expensive hangover.,1051
123790,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199222,u5161,FRANK,No you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.,1051
123791,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199221,u5164,JACK,The party's over.,1051
123792,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199220,u5161,FRANK,Celebrating.  Join me?,1051
123793,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199219,u5164,JACK,What're you doing down here?,1051
123794,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199202,u5164,JACK,You're a heavy sleeper Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper.  Unlike me.,1051
123795,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199201,u5161,FRANK,How come I didn't hear anything?,1051
123796,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199200,u5164,JACK,He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.,1051
123797,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199199,u5161,FRANK,He was wearing a suit.,1051
123798,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199198,u5164,JACK,We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.,1051
123799,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199197,u5161,FRANK,What are you talking about?,1051
123800,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199196,u5164,JACK,He's with the hotel.  I called him.,1051
123801,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199195,u5161,FRANK,Huh?,1051
123802,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199194,u5164,JACK,You saw wrong.,1051
123803,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199191,u5161,FRANK,We were just having a little discussion about morality.,1051
123804,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199190,u5164,JACK,What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?,1051
123805,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199170,u5161,FRANK,Thinking there's someone who looks like you walking around the street somewhere.  Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?,1051
123806,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199169,u5164,JACK,What?,1051
123807,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199168,u5161,FRANK,Funny huh?,1051
123808,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199158,u5161,FRANK,Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road. See every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card leaves it at the front desk and that night we play it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.  And that's not all.  Last night after the nine o'clock he corners me right and starts asking about our availability.  Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.,1051
123809,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199157,u5164,JACK,What the hell are these?,1051
123810,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199156,u5161,FRANK,Yeah well she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?,1051
123811,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199155,u5164,JACK,She's a big girl.,1051
123812,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199154,u5161,FRANK,Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.,1051
123813,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199153,u5164,JACK,No. Why?,1051
123814,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199152,u5161,FRANK,You haven't seen Susie have you?,1051
123815,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199149,u5164,JACK,Time flies huh?,1051
123816,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199148,u5161,FRANK,Two hours ago!,1051
123817,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199147,u5164,JACK,They stopped serving two hours ago.,1051
123818,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199146,u5161,FRANK,Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?,1051
123819,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199145,u5164,JACK,How long you been at it?,1051
123820,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199144,u5161,FRANK,Fine.,1051
123821,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199143,u5164,JACK,How's it coming?,1051
123822,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199142,u5161,FRANK,Yes really.  I don't want you to be unhappy Jack.  If you say it's out of tune it's out of tune.,1051
123823,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199141,u5164,JACK,Really.,1051
123824,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199140,u5161,FRANK,What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.,1051
123825,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199139,u5164,JACK,What the hell are you doing?,1051
123826,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199124,u5164,JACK,It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.,1051
123827,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199123,u5161,FRANK,How dare you say you love me.,1051
123828,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199122,u5164,JACK,I'm sorry Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.,1051
123829,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199121,u5161,FRANK,What's the matter with you?,1051
123830,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199115,u5164,JACK,I love you.  I just wanted to say it.,1051
123831,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199114,u5161,FRANK,What?,1051
123832,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199113,u5164,JACK,Right.  I love you Frank.,1051
123833,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199112,u5161,FRANK,Thank you thank you.  You know Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel well a part of the family. And it's their hope that before you leave everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So if during-the next few days we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here there are no strangers only friends. And family.  Right Jack?,1051
123834,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199107,u5161,FRANK,Well then stuff cotton in your ears because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand little brother?,1051
123835,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199106,u5164,JACK,Because I can hear it.,1051
123836,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199105,u5161,FRANK,What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?,1051
123837,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199104,u5164,JACK,Doesn't it matter to you?,1051
123838,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199103,u5161,FRANK,No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.,1051
123839,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199102,u5164,JACK,Christ can't you hear it?,1051
123840,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199101,u5161,FRANK,What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?,1051
123841,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199100,u5164,JACK,No that's your problem Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.,1051
123842,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199099,u5161,FRANK,Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.,1051
123843,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199097,u5164,JACK,Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.,1051
123844,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199096,u5161,FRANK,I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say Jack is --,1051
123845,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199095,u5164,JACK,Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.,1051
123846,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199075,u5161,FRANK,I don't know.  I mean I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?,1051
123847,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199074,u5164,JACK,Why would I mind?,1051
123848,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199073,u5161,FRANK,Yeah.  You mind?,1051
123849,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199072,u5164,JACK,So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.,1051
123850,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199071,u5161,FRANK,Yeah.,1051
123851,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199070,u5164,JACK,We're gonna be here a week?,1051
123852,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199069,u5161,FRANK,Yeah.,1051
123853,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199068,u5164,JACK,All night?,1051
123854,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199067,u5161,FRANK,Yeah.,1051
123855,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199066,u5164,JACK,You leaving that on?,1051
123856,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199065,u5164,JACK,Right.,1051
123857,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199064,u5161,FRANK,But if it doesn't work out let me know.  I'mflexible.,1051
123858,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199063,u5164,JACK,Good idea.,1051
123859,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199062,u5161,FRANK,I just figure things'll go smoother you know if we have it all worked out from the beginning.,1051
123860,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199061,u5164,JACK,Okay.,1051
123861,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199060,u5161,FRANK,We might as well do the towels the same way.,1051
123862,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199059,u5164,JACK,No you take the right.,1051
123863,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199058,u5161,FRANK,Unless you want the right.,1051
123864,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199057,u5164,JACK,Right.,1051
123865,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199056,u5161,FRANK,I figure that way we won't get confused.,1051
123866,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199055,u5164,JACK,Okay.,1051
123867,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199054,u5161,FRANK,I'm putting my stuff on the right okay?,1051
123868,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199053,u5161,FRANK,Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.,1051
123869,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199052,u5164,JACK,Have some more wine Frank.,1051
123870,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199049,u5161,FRANK,Not true.  Besides Jack's the romantic.,1051
123871,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199048,u5164,JACK,He's drunk.,1051
123872,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199039,u5161,FRANK,A few bars!,1051
123873,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199038,u5164,JACK,Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song she said yes and we did a few bars.,1051
123874,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199037,u5161,FRANK,Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.,1051
123875,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199036,u5164,JACK,We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.,1051
123876,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199035,u5161,FRANK,It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.,1051
123877,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199034,u5164,JACK,She was staying at the Grand downtown ...,1051
123878,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199029,u5161,FRANK,Come on Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.,1051
123879,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199028,u5164,JACK,I thought we all had separate rooms.,1051
123880,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199027,u5161,FRANK,We do.  She's got hers we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.,1051
123881,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L199026,u5164,JACK,I thought we had separate rooms.,1051

123888,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198993,u5161,FRANK,When's the last time we played a wedding Jack?,1051
123889,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198946,u5161,FRANK,All right but if you change your mind let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.,1051
123890,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198945,u5164,JACK,Thanks but I've got plans.,1051
123891,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198944,u5161,FRANK,You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey stuffing the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.,1051
123892,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198943,u5161,FRANK,Well the line's growing weaker little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.,1051
123893,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198942,u5164,JACK,Yeah.,1051
123894,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198941,u5161,FRANK,Yeah well what can I say?  Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus you remember him being this big?,1051
123895,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198940,u5164,JACK,Very realistic.,1051
123896,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198939,u5161,FRANK,So what do you think?,1051
123897,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198938,u5164,JACK,Just a lucky guess.,1051
123898,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198937,u5161,FRANK,You recognized me.,1051
123899,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198936,u5164,JACK,Hey Frank.,1051
123900,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198895,u5164,JACK,Right.,1051

123907,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198887,u5161,FRANK,Something huh?  All those bids.,1051
123908,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198886,u5164,JACK,I'll take my chances.,1051
123909,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198885,u5161,FRANK,Better take care of your fingers little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.',1051
123910,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198879,u5161,FRANK,That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton the Ambassador or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.,1051
123911,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198878,u5164,JACK,Make it collect.,1051
123912,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198875,u5161,FRANK,That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.,1051
123913,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198874,u5164,JACK,Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.,1051
123914,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198802,u5161,FRANK,And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight because well tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and as far as I'm concerned she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place and that place is this place the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song Miss Susie Diamond.,1051
123915,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198801,u5164,JACK,Oh brother.,1051
123916,m342,the fabulous baker boys,L198759,u5161,FRANK,Jack for crying out loud.  Your bachelorhood's showing.  Ah here we go.,1051

147916,m435,meet joe black,L376828,u6552,PARRISH,I guess you have your reasons.,1089
147917,m435,meet joe black,L376827,u6551,JOE,Not exactly.,1089

147919,m435,meet joe black,L376825,u6551,JOE,Happy Birthday Bill.,1089
147920,m435,meet joe black,L376782,u6551,JOE,An indictable offense.,1089
147921,m435,meet joe black,L376781,u6552,PARRISH,An offense --,1089
147922,m435,meet joe black,L376780,u6551,JOE,Undisclosed conflict of interest --,1089
147923,m435,meet joe black,L376779,u6552,PARRISH,Moreover Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately that's known as a conflict of interest --,1089
147924,m435,meet joe black,L376778,u6551,JOE,And we're very grateful.,1089
147925,m435,meet joe black,L376777,u6552,PARRISH,The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou on past deals had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.,1089
147926,m435,meet joe black,L376775,u6552,PARRISH,-- An IRS man.,1089
147927,m435,meet joe black,L376774,u6551,JOE,I'll take it from here --  I am --,1089
147928,m435,meet joe black,L376773,u6552,PARRISH,He is --,1089
147929,m435,meet joe black,L376772,u6551,JOE,Prepare yourself Drew - I am --,1089
147930,m435,meet joe black,L376771,u6552,PARRISH,I told you to shut up.,1089
147931,m435,meet joe black,L376767,u6552,PARRISH,It's not necessary Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --,1089
147932,m435,meet joe black,L376766,u6551,JOE,It's time to put this person where he belongs.,1089
147933,m435,meet joe black,L376765,u6552,PARRISH,Joe don't do this --,1089
147934,m435,meet joe black,L376746,u6552,PARRISH,Get him in here.,1089
147935,m435,meet joe black,L376745,u6551,JOE,Okay.,1089
147936,m435,meet joe black,L376715,u6552,PARRISH,I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born and I love her now and every minute in between and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her who is worthy of her who is of this world of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.,1089
147937,m435,meet joe black,L376714,u6551,JOE,Are you threatening me?,1089
147938,m435,meet joe black,L376713,u6552,PARRISH,I don't expect you to.,1089
147939,m435,meet joe black,L376712,u6551,JOE,I don't like what you're saying.,1089
147940,m435,meet joe black,L376711,u6552,PARRISH,Does she know where she's going?,1089
147941,m435,meet joe black,L376710,u6551,JOE,No.,1089
147942,m435,meet joe black,L376709,u6552,PARRISH,With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?,1089
147943,m435,meet joe black,L376708,u6551,JOE,Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.,1089
147944,m435,meet joe black,L376707,u6552,PARRISH,Well they're mine now.,1089
147945,m435,meet joe black,L376706,u6551,JOE,Those were my words Bill.,1089
147946,m435,meet joe black,L376705,u6552,PARRISH,Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.,1089
147947,m435,meet joe black,L376704,u6551,JOE,So that's what love is?,1089
147948,m435,meet joe black,L376703,u6552,PARRISH,Trust responsibility taking the weight for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all not hurting the object of your love.,1089
147949,m435,meet joe black,L376702,u6551,JOE,Which is what?,1089
147950,m435,meet joe black,L376701,u6552,PARRISH,Some aimless infatuation in which for the moment you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.,1089
147951,m435,meet joe black,L376700,u6551,JOE,Then what is it?,1089
147952,m435,meet joe black,L376699,u6552,PARRISH,How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --,1089
147953,m435,meet joe black,L376698,u6551,JOE,I love her Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before if you can understand.,1089
147954,m435,meet joe black,L376697,u6552,PARRISH,Susan is my daughter she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well I'm sorry apology not accepted.,1089
147955,m435,meet joe black,L376696,u6551,JOE,I'm sorry Bill --,1089
147956,m435,meet joe black,L376695,u6552,PARRISH,You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?,1089
147957,m435,meet joe black,L376694,u6551,JOE,I think you heard me Bill.,1089
147958,m435,meet joe black,L376693,u6552,PARRISH,You're what?,1089
147959,m435,meet joe black,L376692,u6551,JOE,I'm in love with your daughter and I'm taking her with me tonight.,1089
147960,m435,meet joe black,L376691,u6552,PARRISH,Say again?,1089
147961,m435,meet joe black,L376690,u6551,JOE,-- And I'm in love with your daughter.,1089
147962,m435,meet joe black,L376689,u6552,PARRISH,You 'want to know' I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death he's galloping into it.  And the same time the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.  And oh yes I almost forgot my daughter's fallen in love with Death.,1089
147963,m435,meet joe black,L376688,u6551,JOE,I was just asking Bill.,1089
147964,m435,meet joe black,L376687,u6552,PARRISH,What the hell do you care?,1089
147965,m435,meet joe black,L376686,u6551,JOE,Not at all.,1089
147966,m435,meet joe black,L376685,u6552,PARRISH,Thanks.,1089

147970,m435,meet joe black,L376585,u6552,PARRISH,What are you saying that it's time to go?,1089
147971,m435,meet joe black,L376584,u6551,JOE,-- I have the feeling that all in all what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.,1089
147972,m435,meet joe black,L376583,u6552,PARRISH,Yes?,1089
147973,m435,meet joe black,L376582,u6551,JOE,Uh --,1089
147974,m435,meet joe black,L376525,u6551,JOE,I told you 'watch it'.,1089
147975,m435,meet joe black,L376524,u6552,PARRISH,Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.,1089
147976,m435,meet joe black,L376523,u6551,JOE,May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor this is me.  So watch it...Bill.,1089
147977,m435,meet joe black,L376522,u6552,PARRISH,And I don't give a shit.,1089
147978,m435,meet joe black,L376521,u6551,JOE,I don't like your tone and I don't like your references.,1089
147979,m435,meet joe black,L376520,u6552,PARRISH,Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.,1089
147980,m435,meet joe black,L376519,u6551,JOE,This universe?,1089
147981,m435,meet joe black,L376518,u6552,PARRISH,You're violating the laws of the universe.,1089
147982,m435,meet joe black,L376515,u6551,JOE,I picked you for your verve your excellence and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct.  You've lived a first-rate life.  And I find it eminently usable.,1089
147983,m435,meet joe black,L376514,u6552,PARRISH,Yes and stop repeating everything I say and turning it into a question. Spooning fooling around God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me I still don't under- stand --,1089
147984,m435,meet joe black,L376513,u6551,JOE,'Spooning'?,1089
147985,m435,meet joe black,L376512,u6552,PARRISH,Well you goddam well should.  You walk into my life give me the worst news a guy can get have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family and now you're spooning with my daughter.,1089
147986,m435,meet joe black,L376511,u6551,JOE,With all due respect Bill I'm not asking your permission.,1089
147987,m435,meet joe black,L376510,u6552,PARRISH,I'm her father!,1089
147988,m435,meet joe black,L376509,u6551,JOE,I'll be the judge of that.,1089
147989,m435,meet joe black,L376508,u6552,PARRISH,Well you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.,1089
147990,m435,meet joe black,L376507,u6551,JOE,Yes I saw you see me.,1089
147991,m435,meet joe black,L376505,u6551,JOE,I'm sorry to hear that.,1089
147992,m435,meet joe black,L376504,u6552,PARRISH,I couldn't sleep.,1089
147993,m435,meet joe black,L376478,u6552,PARRISH,Then I can't help you.,1089

147995,m435,meet joe black,L376476,u6552,PARRISH,Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going to take a nap.,1089
147996,m435,meet joe black,L376475,u6551,JOE,'Fish'?,1089
147997,m435,meet joe black,L376474,u6552,PARRISH,What 'okay' is it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry don't we Joe?,1089
147998,m435,meet joe black,L376473,u6552,PARRISH,Just a manner of speaking.,1089
147999,m435,meet joe black,L376472,u6551,JOE,What's okay?,1089
148000,m435,meet joe black,L376471,u6552,PARRISH,That's okay.,1089
148001,m435,meet joe black,L376470,u6551,JOE,I'm sorry Bill --,1089
148002,m435,meet joe black,L376425,u6551,JOE,Goodnight.,1089

148007,m435,meet joe black,L376289,u6551,JOE,Are you going to fire me Bill?,1089
148008,m435,meet joe black,L376288,u6552,PARRISH,How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me I fire.,1089

148010,m435,meet joe black,L376286,u6552,PARRISH,What way would you put it?,1089

148017,m435,meet joe black,L376176,u6551,JOE,Easy Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.,1089
148018,m435,meet joe black,L376175,u6552,PARRISH,And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.,1089

148020,m435,meet joe black,L376173,u6552,PARRISH,I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor of dedication of truth. Okay?,1089
148021,m435,meet joe black,L376172,u6551,JOE,Why at this juncture are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?,1089
148022,m435,meet joe black,L376170,u6551,JOE,Absolutely.,1089

148027,m435,meet joe black,L376149,u6552,PARRISH,Why didn't you stop me?,1089
148028,m435,meet joe black,L376148,u6551,JOE,And more.,1089
148029,m435,meet joe black,L376147,u6552,PARRISH,Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.,1089

148037,m435,meet joe black,L376079,u6551,JOE,No thank you Bill.  I can manage.,1089

148039,m435,meet joe black,L376075,u6551,JOE,Oh.  Okay.,1089
148040,m435,meet joe black,L376074,u6552,PARRISH,Now I'd like to be alone.,1089

148042,m435,meet joe black,L376072,u6552,PARRISH,Joe could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.,1089
148043,m435,meet joe black,L376071,u6551,JOE,You're not thinking of going some- where are you Bill?,1089
148044,m435,meet joe black,L376070,u6552,PARRISH,Yes I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?,1089
148045,m435,meet joe black,L376069,u6551,JOE,Are you sad Bill?,1089
148046,m435,meet joe black,L376068,u6552,PARRISH,...I'd like to be alone for a while.,1089

148048,m435,meet joe black,L376066,u6552,PARRISH,-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?,1089

148072,m435,meet joe black,L375999,u6552,PARRISH,Joe --?,1089
148073,m435,meet joe black,L375998,u6551,JOE,So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.,1089
148074,m435,meet joe black,L375997,u6552,PARRISH,Of course.,1089
148075,m435,meet joe black,L375996,u6551,JOE,So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here your work what your task is is being executed elsewhere.,1089
148076,m435,meet joe black,L375995,u6552,PARRISH,I guess so.,1089
148077,m435,meet joe black,L375994,u6551,JOE,You were hatching ideas making plans arriving at decisions right?,1089

148082,m435,meet joe black,L375987,u6551,JOE,Bill --,1089
148083,m435,meet joe black,L375986,u6552,PARRISH,You give your word I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.,1089
148084,m435,meet joe black,L375985,u6551,JOE,A 'deal'?,1089
148085,m435,meet joe black,L375984,u6552,PARRISH,It is a deal?,1089
148086,m435,meet joe black,L375983,u6551,JOE,Sounds fair enough.,1089
148087,m435,meet joe black,L375982,u6552,PARRISH,And I won't tell anyone who you are.,1089

148089,m435,meet joe black,L375979,u6551,JOE,Oh I wouldn't tell them anything Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting but I am cer- tain should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.,1089
148090,m435,meet joe black,L375978,u6552,PARRISH,Um -- well I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?,1089
148091,m435,meet joe black,L375977,u6551,JOE,'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?,1089
148092,m435,meet joe black,L375976,u6552,PARRISH,How are you?  How're you feeling?,1089

148096,m435,meet joe black,L375921,u6552,PARRISH,And - uh - I  guess 'goodnight'.,1089
148097,m435,meet joe black,L375920,u6551,JOE,Not at all.,1089
148098,m435,meet joe black,L375919,u6552,PARRISH,Well thank you for letting me know.,1089
148099,m435,meet joe black,L375918,u6552,PARRISH,Closer than that.,1089

148101,m435,meet joe black,L375916,u6552,PARRISH,No --,1089
148102,m435,meet joe black,L375915,u6551,JOE,Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?,1089
148103,m435,meet joe black,L375914,u6552,PARRISH,...I just saw my doctor he told me everything was fine.,1089
148104,m435,meet joe black,L375913,u6551,JOE,That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute I find myself lingering.,1089
148105,m435,meet joe black,L375912,u6552,PARRISH,When you go I go.,1089
148106,m435,meet joe black,L375911,u6551,JOE,You're putting me on the spot Bill.,1089

148110,m435,meet joe black,L375907,u6551,JOE,No.,1089
148111,m435,meet joe black,L375906,u6552,PARRISH,Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?,1089
148112,m435,meet joe black,L375905,u6551,JOE,What a good idea.,1089
148113,m435,meet joe black,L375902,u6551,JOE,It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides isn't this what I'm here for?,1089
148114,m435,meet joe black,L375901,u6552,PARRISH,I wish you had said something to me about staying here --,1089
148115,m435,meet joe black,L375900,u6551,JOE,No.,1089
148116,m435,meet joe black,L375899,u6552,PARRISH,So there's nothing between you and Susan?,1089
148117,m435,meet joe black,L375898,u6551,JOE,I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.,1089
148118,m435,meet joe black,L375897,u6552,PARRISH,Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --,1089

148126,m435,meet joe black,L375810,u6552,PARRISH,When I introduce you if I say who you are I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.,1089
148128,m435,meet joe black,L375808,u6552,PARRISH,It just occurred to me --,1089
148130,m435,meet joe black,L375806,u6552,PARRISH,Excuse me?  Could I say something?,1089
148132,m435,meet joe black,L375804,u6552,PARRISH,This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.,1089

148286,m435,meet joe black,L376324,u6552,PARRISH,I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before but I've come to appreciate --,1089

148316,m435,meet joe black,L375602,u6552,PARRISH,You won't tell him and even if you did he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.,1089
148317,m435,meet joe black,L375601,u6555,SUSAN,I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it he won't either.,1089

148321,m435,meet joe black,L375597,u6555,SUSAN,Bravo.,1089
148322,m435,meet joe black,L375596,u6552,PARRISH,I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion obsession someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk if you get hurt you'll come back.  Because the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried you haven't lived.,1089
148323,m435,meet joe black,L375595,u6555,SUSAN,'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --,1089

148327,m435,meet joe black,L375591,u6555,SUSAN,Don't get dirty Dad --,1089
148328,m435,meet joe black,L375590,u6552,PARRISH,Oh yes I am.  Not an ounce of excitement not a whisper of a thrill this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.,1089
148329,m435,meet joe black,L375589,u6555,SUSAN,You're not listening --,1089
148330,m435,meet joe black,L375588,u6552,PARRISH,That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew it's what you don't say.,1089
148331,m435,meet joe black,L375587,u6555,SUSAN,So what's wrong with that?,1089

148374,m435,meet joe black,L375717,u6555,SUSAN,No it was so right it scares me.,1089
148376,m435,meet joe black,L375715,u6555,SUSAN,I've got to go --,1089
148378,m435,meet joe black,L375713,u6555,SUSAN,You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --,1089
148380,m435,meet joe black,L375711,u6555,SUSAN,You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?,1089

157740,m475,playback,L446553,u7088,BETTY,I don't like being referred to as babe or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact to be very frank Mr. Mitchell I don't think I like you.,840
157742,m475,playback,L446551,u7088,BETTY,Please be a little more careful how you talk Mr. Mitchell.,840
157744,m475,playback,L446549,u7088,BETTY,I think I'd like to dance.,840
157745,m475,playback,L446546,u7088,BETTY,How do you do?,840

157755,m475,playback,L446437,u7088,BETTY,Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.,840

157783,m475,playback,L446343,u7088,BETTY,Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?,840
157785,m475,playback,L446341,u7088,BETTY,Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.,840
157787,m475,playback,L446309,u7088,BETTY,I'm going to Vancouver Mr. Mitchell.,840
157789,m475,playback,L446307,u7088,BETTY,How far does this train go?,840

157811,m475,playback,L447453,u7088,BETTY,Do you think I was faking?,840

157814,m475,playback,L447446,u7089,BRANDON,Me?,840
157815,m475,playback,L447445,u7088,BETTY,If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.,840
157816,m475,playback,L447444,u7089,BRANDON,This is it Betty.  They'll find us again fog or no fog.,840

157820,m475,playback,L447435,u7088,BETTY,But the next one is murder.  First the little step then the longer step  and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.,840
157821,m475,playback,L447434,u7089,BRANDON,You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?,840
157822,m475,playback,L447433,u7088,BETTY,Magruder does.,840
157823,m475,playback,L447432,u7089,BRANDON,Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him what connects him with me?,840
157824,m475,playback,L447431,u7088,BETTY,And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.,840
157825,m475,playback,L447430,u7089,BRANDON,Mitchell was dead enough.,840
157826,m475,playback,L447429,u7088,BETTY,Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.,840
157827,m475,playback,L447428,u7089,BRANDON,Mine?,840
157828,m475,playback,L447427,u7088,BETTY,And I'm begging for my life--and yours.,840
157829,m475,playback,L447426,u7089,BRANDON,It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.,840
157830,m475,playback,L447424,u7089,BRANDON,I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board nobody seen you since.,840
157831,m475,playback,L447423,u7088,BETTY,You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.,840
157832,m475,playback,L447376,u7088,BETTY,So that I will never be found.,840
157833,m475,playback,L447375,u7089,BRANDON,Don't go soft on me baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.,840
157834,m475,playback,L447374,u7088,BETTY,I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?,840
157835,m475,playback,L447373,u7089,BRANDON,Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.,840
157836,m475,playback,L447372,u7088,BETTY,You-killed-him?,840
157837,m475,playback,L447371,u7089,BRANDON,Not this one.  And not Mitchell.,840
157838,m475,playback,L447370,u7088,BETTY,He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.,840
157839,m475,playback,L447369,u7089,BRANDON,No.  I paid him off.,840
157840,m475,playback,L447368,u7088,BETTY,That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him too.  Was he really following me--or you?,840
157841,m475,playback,L447367,u7089,BRANDON,It buys things just like any other kind.,840
157842,m475,playback,L447366,u7088,BETTY,The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please go where you please.  You big open-handed generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes isn't it?,840
157843,m475,playback,L447365,u7089,BRANDON,Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from don't you?,840
157844,m475,playback,L447364,u7088,BETTY,What your father did doesn't condemn you.,840
157845,m475,playback,L447363,u7089,BRANDON,So could you.  But our records were a little against us.,840
157846,m475,playback,L447362,u7088,BETTY,If it was an accident you could have told the truth.,840
157847,m475,playback,L447361,u7089,BRANDON,In a way.,840
157848,m475,playback,L447360,u7088,BETTY,Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him.,840
157849,m475,playback,L447359,u7089,BRANDON,I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.,840
157850,m475,playback,L447358,u7088,BETTY,Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.,840
157851,m475,playback,L447357,u7089,BRANDON,Including Killaine.,840
157852,m475,playback,L447356,u7088,BETTY,Funny I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.,840
157853,m475,playback,L447354,u7089,BRANDON,That's right.,840
157854,m475,playback,L447353,u7088,BETTY,I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.,840
157855,m475,playback,L447352,u7089,BRANDON,That and the fun of it.,840
157856,m475,playback,L447351,u7088,BETTY,If you're doing all this just for me.,840
157857,m475,playback,L447350,u7089,BRANDON,Wonder what?,840
157858,m475,playback,L447349,u7088,BETTY,I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.,840
157859,m475,playback,L447347,u7089,BRANDON,Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  Careful how you go we're hitting the swell now.,840
157860,m475,playback,L447346,u7088,BETTY,Frozen.,840
157861,m475,playback,L447345,u7089,BRANDON,Cold?,840
157862,m475,playback,L447344,u7089,BRANDON,There would be a moon tonight.,840
157863,m475,playback,L447343,u7088,BETTY,I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.,840
157864,m475,playback,L447342,u7089,BRANDON,See anything?,840
157865,m475,playback,L447283,u7088,BETTY,Killaine's wise to what?,840
157866,m475,playback,L447282,u7089,BRANDON,Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when. ,840
157867,m475,playback,L447271,u7088,BETTY,You leave it.,840
157868,m475,playback,L447270,u7089,BRANDON,Well?,840
157869,m475,playback,L447269,u7089,BRANDON,My father died in jail and he was twice the man I am.,840
157870,m475,playback,L447268,u7088,BETTY,You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.,840
157871,m475,playback,L447267,u7089,BRANDON,I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.,840
157872,m475,playback,L447266,u7089,BRANDON,It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.,840
157873,m475,playback,L447265,u7088,BETTY,Do you have to leave the note?,840
157874,m475,playback,L447264,u7089,BRANDON,It did but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.,840
157875,m475,playback,L447263,u7088,BETTY,This must have cost a fortune.,840
157876,m475,playback,L447262,u7089,BRANDON,You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.,840
157877,m475,playback,L447244,u7089,BRANDON,The best interference runner we've got.  He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman.  Come here baby.,840
157878,m475,playback,L447243,u7088,BETTY,Killaine...,840
157879,m475,playback,L447242,u7089,BRANDON,If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.,840
157880,m475,playback,L447241,u7088,BETTY,But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?,840
157881,m475,playback,L447240,u7089,BRANDON,Blonde beautiful and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.,840
157882,m475,playback,L447239,u7088,BETTY,And Betty Mayfield--,840
157883,m475,playback,L447238,u7089,BRANDON,I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.,840
157884,m475,playback,L447237,u7088,BETTY,They'll look for you.,840
157885,m475,playback,L447236,u7089,BRANDON,This is the ace Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? ,840
157886,m475,playback,L447235,u7088,BETTY,I was tried for murdering my husband.  Guilty.  The judge set the verdict aside.  There was one man on the jury--  --but he was afraid.  They were all afraid--of my father-in-law. That man followed me last night-- he came from him of course.  My father-in-law will never give up. Never.  He promised me that.  So I came to Vancouver B.C. As far away as I can get from North Carolina.  And it happens all over again.  Almost the same thing. Almost the same way.  Do you wonder about this--,840
157887,m475,playback,L447234,u7089,BRANDON,How bad is the other thing?  The secret?,840
157888,m475,playback,L447233,u7088,BETTY,Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.,840
157889,m475,playback,L447232,u7088,BETTY,Yes.  I've never been very far from it for a long time.  Will you do something for me?,840
157890,m475,playback,L447231,u7089,BRANDON,How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- ,840
157891,m475,playback,L447230,u7088,BETTY,That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?,840
157892,m475,playback,L447229,u7089,BRANDON,There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness and open water and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you I'd be committing a crime or so they tell me.,840
157893,m475,playback,L447228,u7088,BETTY,Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.,840
157894,m475,playback,L447227,u7089,BRANDON,If you meant it you wouldn't show it to me Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?,840
157895,m475,playback,L447225,u7088,BETTY,I have my own warrant.  Stop a minute please.,840
157896,m475,playback,L447224,u7089,BRANDON,I know.  Killaine has a warrant.,840
157897,m475,playback,L447223,u7088,BETTY,They're going to arrest me.,840
157898,m475,playback,L447222,u7089,BRANDON,No percentage in that.,840
157899,m475,playback,L447221,u7088,BETTY,I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.,840
157900,m475,playback,L447192,u7089,BRANDON,You're probably mistaken about that.  Let's get together sand talk it over.  There's always a solution to these problems.  But it must be near the water.  Quite near--  Yes if you don't mind waiting.,840
157901,m475,playback,L447191,u7088,BETTY,There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.,840
157902,m475,playback,L447190,u7089,BRANDON,Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?,840
157903,m475,playback,L447189,u7089,BRANDON,I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.,840
157904,m475,playback,L447188,u7088,BETTY,I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--,840
157905,m475,playback,L447187,u7089,BRANDON,It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?,840
157906,m475,playback,L446867,u7089,BRANDON,From you I like it.,840
157907,m475,playback,L446866,u7088,BETTY,So have I.,840
157908,m475,playback,L446865,u7089,BRANDON,That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.,840
157909,m475,playback,L446864,u7089,BRANDON,No use waiting then.,840
157910,m475,playback,L446863,u7088,BETTY,Nothing matters.,840
157911,m475,playback,L446862,u7089,BRANDON,It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?,840
157912,m475,playback,L446861,u7089,BRANDON,Try not talking.,840
157913,m475,playback,L446860,u7088,BETTY,Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?,840
157914,m475,playback,L446859,u7089,BRANDON,Anything I can do about it?,840
157915,m475,playback,L446858,u7088,BETTY,No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.,840
157916,m475,playback,L446857,u7089,BRANDON,Why?,840
157917,m475,playback,L446856,u7088,BETTY,All right--following me.,840
157918,m475,playback,L446855,u7089,BRANDON,Us?,840
157919,m475,playback,L446854,u7088,BETTY,He was following us--but he's not a policeman.,840
157920,m475,playback,L446853,u7089,BRANDON,He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.,840
157921,m475,playback,L446852,u7088,BETTY,You don't know who he is?,840
157922,m475,playback,L446851,u7089,BRANDON,He's a fellow with a very hard knee and he knows how to use it.,840
157923,m475,playback,L446836,u7089,BRANDON,We'll find out.,840
157924,m475,playback,L446835,u7088,BETTY,Absolutely sure.,840
157925,m475,playback,L446834,u7089,BRANDON,Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?,840
157926,m475,playback,L446832,u7088,BETTY,Then he's-- ,840
157927,m475,playback,L446831,u7089,BRANDON,Couldn't be.,840
157928,m475,playback,L446830,u7088,BETTY,Then he's got to be a detective.,840
157929,m475,playback,L446829,u7089,BRANDON,Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.,840
157930,m475,playback,L446828,u7088,BETTY,We walked right passed him. He's following us.,840
157931,m475,playback,L446827,u7089,BRANDON,I didn't notice him.,840
157932,m475,playback,L446826,u7088,BETTY,That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.,840
157933,m475,playback,L446824,u7089,BRANDON,I know everybody. I don't look at half of life just the nice half I look at all of it.,840
157934,m475,playback,L446823,u7088,BETTY,They know you here--know your name.,840
157935,m475,playback,L446822,u7089,BRANDON,Why not?,840
157936,m475,playback,L446821,u7088,BETTY,Dance? Here?,840
157937,m475,playback,L446820,u7089,BRANDON,Want to dance?,840
157938,m475,playback,L446810,u7089,BRANDON,At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.,840
157939,m475,playback,L446809,u7088,BETTY,Is this the best you can do?,840
157940,m475,playback,L446808,u7089,BRANDON,Cold?,840
157941,m475,playback,L446802,u7089,BRANDON,I'm different. I like it fine.,840
157942,m475,playback,L446801,u7088,BETTY,You too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.,840
157943,m475,playback,L446800,u7089,BRANDON,Just who are you anyway?,840
157944,m475,playback,L446799,u7088,BETTY,Certainly not to me.,840
157945,m475,playback,L446798,u7089,BRANDON,Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.,840
157946,m475,playback,L446797,u7088,BETTY,Dance? Tonight?,840
157947,m475,playback,L446796,u7089,BRANDON,So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.,840
157948,m475,playback,L446795,u7088,BETTY,There's a lot of night left to live through.,840
157949,m475,playback,L446794,u7089,BRANDON,Quarter after one. Why?,840
157950,m475,playback,L446793,u7088,BETTY,What time is it?,840
157951,m475,playback,L446792,u7088,BETTY,That's putting it mildly.,840
157952,m475,playback,L446791,u7089,BRANDON,He could hardly help suspecting you.,840
157953,m475,playback,L446790,u7088,BETTY,Bad enough.,840
157954,m475,playback,L446789,u7089,BRANDON,Bad?,840
157955,m475,playback,L446786,u7089,BRANDON,You didn't have to tell him that.,840
157956,m475,playback,L446785,u7088,BETTY,There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.,840
157957,m475,playback,L446657,u7088,BETTY,No thanks.,840
157958,m475,playback,L446656,u7089,BRANDON,Want a spike in it?,840
157959,m475,playback,L446655,u7089,BRANDON,It's always a mistake to run away. Always.,840
157960,m475,playback,L446654,u7088,BETTY,There wasn't any plane.,840
157961,m475,playback,L446653,u7089,BRANDON,You tried to run away.,840
157962,m475,playback,L446652,u7089,BRANDON,I'd rather wait until it does matter.,840
157963,m475,playback,L446651,u7088,BETTY,Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.,840
157964,m475,playback,L446649,u7088,BETTY,That's all there is.,840
157965,m475,playback,L446648,u7089,BRANDON,He was a great boy for that. What else?,840
157966,m475,playback,L446647,u7088,BETTY,He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.,840
157967,m475,playback,L446646,u7089,BRANDON,Nice of him.,840
157968,m475,playback,L446645,u7088,BETTY,On a train. He said he lived here and he offered to make a reservation for me.,840
157969,m475,playback,L446644,u7089,BRANDON,How did you meet him?,840
157970,m475,playback,L446643,u7088,BETTY,I don't.,840
157971,m475,playback,L446642,u7089,BRANDON,They'll know whether he killed himself.,840
157972,m475,playback,L446640,u7089,BRANDON,Sure... but somebody always does..,840
157973,m475,playback,L446639,u7088,BETTY,No. And I've never fired a gun in my life Aren't you supposed not to touch it?,840
157974,m475,playback,L446637,u7088,BETTY,Not with my consent strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything.,840
157975,m475,playback,L446636,u7089,BRANDON,He got in here how?,840
157976,m475,playback,L446635,u7088,BETTY,There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.,840
157977,m475,playback,L446632,u7088,BETTY,There's one less tonight.,840
157978,m475,playback,L446631,u7089,BRANDON,What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.,840
157979,m475,playback,L446630,u7088,BETTY,You said it wasn't a tragedy.,840
157980,m475,playback,L446628,u7089,BRANDON,Don't take it so big... it isn't a tragedy.,840
157981,m475,playback,L446627,u7088,BETTY,Much too late.,840
157982,m475,playback,L446626,u7089,BRANDON,I know it's a littler late for an apology.,840
157983,m475,playback,L446569,u7088,BETTY,No thank you.,840
157984,m475,playback,L446568,u7089,BRANDON,Dance?,840
157985,m475,playback,L446488,u7089,BRANDON,He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.,840
157986,m475,playback,L446487,u7088,BETTY,You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?,840
157987,m475,playback,L446486,u7089,BRANDON,Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.,840
157988,m475,playback,L446485,u7088,BETTY,Do you think I don't?,840
157989,m475,playback,L446484,u7089,BRANDON,Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.,840
157990,m475,playback,L446483,u7088,BETTY,I hate to be alone. But I've heard all the approaches there are... even yours.,840
157991,m475,playback,L446482,u7089,BRANDON,I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.,840
157992,m475,playback,L446481,u7088,BETTY,I didn't say anything.,840
157993,m475,playback,L446480,u7089,BRANDON,Whatever you say.,840
157994,m475,playback,L446479,u7088,BETTY,Would it make you anymore amusing?,840
157995,m475,playback,L446478,u7089,BRANDON,I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact I'd like a dry Martini myself.,840
157996,m475,playback,L446477,u7088,BETTY,You're drinking it.,840
157997,m475,playback,L446476,u7089,BRANDON,No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?,840
157998,m475,playback,L446475,u7088,BETTY,And do you amuse the guests?,840
157999,m475,playback,L446474,u7089,BRANDON,I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.,840
158000,m475,playback,L446473,u7088,BETTY,You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.,840
158001,m475,playback,L446472,u7089,BRANDON,Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before wouldn't you?,840
158002,m475,playback,L446471,u7088,BETTY,As I said before...,840
158003,m475,playback,L446470,u7089,BRANDON,No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..,840
158004,m475,playback,L446469,u7088,BETTY,You don't sound as if you liked him very much.,840
158005,m475,playback,L446468,u7089,BRANDON,Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.,840
158006,m475,playback,L446467,u7088,BETTY,What did you say his name was?,840
158007,m475,playback,L446466,u7089,BRANDON,It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.,840
158008,m475,playback,L446465,u7088,BETTY,I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.,840
158009,m475,playback,L446464,u7089,BRANDON,It might be worth a Martini to you.,840
158010,m475,playback,L446463,u7088,BETTY,I see.,840
158011,m475,playback,L446462,u7089,BRANDON,A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.,840
158012,m475,playback,L446461,u7089,BRANDON,Disgusting aren't they? If you really want a Martini I know where you can get one.,840
158013,m475,playback,L446460,u7088,BETTY,Your liquor laws..,840
158014,m475,playback,L446450,u7088,BETTY,I see.,840
158015,m475,playback,L446449,u7089,BRANDON,Sit down then. We often have a double up here.,840
158016,m475,playback,L446448,u7088,BETTY,No please.,840
158017,m475,playback,L446447,u7089,BRANDON,You can have the table yourself if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.,840
158019,m475,playback,L446458,u7088,BETTY,Ale. I don't mind.,840
158021,m475,playback,L446456,u7088,BETTY,Beer?  Well all right.,840
158023,m475,playback,L446454,u7088,BETTY,I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry please.,840
158025,m475,playback,L447469,u7095,KILLAINE,I understand Betty.  I understand perfectly.,840
158026,m475,playback,L447468,u7088,BETTY,But I tell you---if you'd only understand.,840
158027,m475,playback,L447467,u7095,KILLAINE,I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.,840
158028,m475,playback,L447466,u7088,BETTY,No Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.,840
158029,m475,playback,L447465,u7095,KILLAINE,We know everything.,840
158030,m475,playback,L447464,u7088,BETTY,He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.,840
158031,m475,playback,L447092,u7095,KILLAINE,Goodbye Betty.,840
158032,m475,playback,L447091,u7088,BETTY,Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man Jeff.,840
158033,m475,playback,L447090,u7095,KILLAINE,Sometimes.,840
158034,m475,playback,L447089,u7088,BETTY,You do things the hard way don't you?,840
158035,m475,playback,L447088,u7095,KILLAINE,There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.,840
158036,m475,playback,L447087,u7088,BETTY,But even if you were in love with me.,840
158037,m475,playback,L447086,u7095,KILLAINE,I know that.,840
158038,m475,playback,L447085,u7088,BETTY,What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.,840
158039,m475,playback,L447084,u7095,KILLAINE,I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman like a judge has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.,840
158040,m475,playback,L447083,u7088,BETTY,What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.,840
158041,m475,playback,L447082,u7088,BETTY,You're still a police officer Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.,840
158042,m475,playback,L447081,u7095,KILLAINE,That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?,840
158043,m475,playback,L447080,u7088,BETTY,What will they do to you?,840
158044,m475,playback,L447079,u7095,KILLAINE,I can't answer that.,840
158045,m475,playback,L447078,u7088,BETTY,To do what?,840
158046,m475,playback,L447077,u7095,KILLAINE,You've got a couple of hours maybe.,840
158047,m475,playback,L447076,u7095,KILLAINE,I'm enough of a copper to do my duty.  My boss made it tough for me.  If I don't arrest you I've gone soft.  If I do it's to save my face.  I don't play those rules.,840
158048,m475,playback,L447075,u7088,BETTY,Because you think your in love with me?,840
158049,m475,playback,L447074,u7095,KILLAINE,That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.,840
158050,m475,playback,L447073,u7088,BETTY,They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.,840
158051,m475,playback,L447072,u7095,KILLAINE,Time's up.  I'm off the case. ,840
158052,m475,playback,L447071,u7088,BETTY,I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.,840
158053,m475,playback,L447070,u7095,KILLAINE,So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.,840
158054,m475,playback,L447069,u7088,BETTY,Looking for peanuts I suppose.,840
158055,m475,playback,L447068,u7095,KILLAINE,Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.,840
158056,m475,playback,L447067,u7088,BETTY,Jeff.  Shall we go now Jeff and get it over with?,840
158057,m475,playback,L447066,u7095,KILLAINE,They call me Jeff.,840
158058,m475,playback,L447065,u7088,BETTY,What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?,840
158059,m475,playback,L447064,u7095,KILLAINE,That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.,840
158060,m475,playback,L447063,u7088,BETTY,Very ridiculous.,840
158061,m475,playback,L447062,u7095,KILLAINE,Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden just after a shower--  Clich√©s one and all--but good ones with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous isn't it?,840
158062,m475,playback,L447061,u7088,BETTY,What does he see?,840
158063,m475,playback,L447060,u7095,KILLAINE,He looks at the girl looks into her eyes--,840
158064,m475,playback,L447059,u7088,BETTY,Points very straight to her.,840
158065,m475,playback,L447054,u7095,KILLAINE,There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.,840
158066,m475,playback,L447053,u7088,BETTY,You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you or you wouldn't be an inspector.,840
158067,m475,playback,L447052,u7095,KILLAINE,I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.,840
158068,m475,playback,L447051,u7088,BETTY,I expected nothing else.,840
158069,m475,playback,L447047,u7095,KILLAINE,I've come here to arrest you for murder.,840
158070,m475,playback,L447046,u7088,BETTY,I don't want to talk.,840
158071,m475,playback,L447045,u7095,KILLAINE,This isn't a very good place to talk.,840
158072,m475,playback,L446954,u7088,BETTY,There isn't anything you can do.,840
158073,m475,playback,L446953,u7095,KILLAINE,Then there isn't much I can do is there?,840
158074,m475,playback,L446952,u7088,BETTY,You understand perfectly.,840
158075,m475,playback,L446951,u7095,KILLAINE,If I understand what you meant by that.,840
158076,m475,playback,L446950,u7088,BETTY,Nobody can help me. You least of all.,840
158077,m475,playback,L446949,u7095,KILLAINE,You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?,840
158078,m475,playback,L446948,u7088,BETTY,You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.,840
158079,m475,playback,L446947,u7095,KILLAINE,We try to be decent.,840
158080,m475,playback,L446946,u7088,BETTY,You--or the Vancouver Police Department?,840
158081,m475,playback,L446945,u7095,KILLAINE,I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?,840
158082,m475,playback,L446944,u7095,KILLAINE,You've has an experience that you don't want to talk about. An unhappy marriage for example.,840
158083,m475,playback,L446943,u7088,BETTY,The police always do don't they?,840
158084,m475,playback,L446942,u7095,KILLAINE,I'll find out you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end I'll find out.,840
158085,m475,playback,L446940,u7095,KILLAINE,I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.,840
158086,m475,playback,L446939,u7088,BETTY,You were there when I last saw him.,840
158087,m475,playback,L446938,u7095,KILLAINE,We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?,840
158088,m475,playback,L446937,u7088,BETTY,Is it a crime?,840
158089,m475,playback,L446936,u7095,KILLAINE,But not in the investigation of a major crime I hope.,840
158090,m475,playback,L446935,u7088,BETTY,Who hasn't--one way or another?,840
158091,m475,playback,L446934,u7095,KILLAINE,You've had dealings with the police before?,840
158092,m475,playback,L446933,u7088,BETTY,You were a galahad compared to some cops I've known.,840
158093,m475,playback,L446932,u7095,KILLAINE,True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.,840
158094,m475,playback,L446931,u7088,BETTY,We wouldn't have met at all.,840
158095,m475,playback,L446930,u7095,KILLAINE,Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club and beyond it the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances Miss Mayfield.,840
158096,m475,playback,L446883,u7088,BETTY,I've never been to Florida.,840
158097,m475,playback,L446882,u7095,KILLAINE,FLorida?,840
158098,m475,playback,L446881,u7095,KILLAINE,You must come from pretty far South.,840
158099,m475,playback,L446880,u7088,BETTY,Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.,840
158100,m475,playback,L446879,u7095,KILLAINE,Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine the sky is a deep blue.,840
158101,m475,playback,L446878,u7095,KILLAINE,They're all crude when they don't work. Had breakfast?,840
158102,m475,playback,L446877,u7088,BETTY,Good morning Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.,840
158103,m475,playback,L446782,u7095,KILLAINE,I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.,840
158104,m475,playback,L446781,u7088,BETTY,Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.,840
158105,m475,playback,L446780,u7095,KILLAINE,An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.,840
158106,m475,playback,L446778,u7088,BETTY,A graduation present.,840
158107,m475,playback,L446777,u7095,KILLAINE,Where's you get it?,840
158108,m475,playback,L446776,u7088,BETTY,Yes.,840
158109,m475,playback,L446775,u7095,KILLAINE,What this?,840
158110,m475,playback,L446774,u7088,BETTY,Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?,840
158111,m475,playback,L446773,u7095,KILLAINE,Stop saying you're sorry. I want information not regrets.,840
158112,m475,playback,L446772,u7088,BETTY,I'm sorry.,840
158113,m475,playback,L446771,u7095,KILLAINE,Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.,840
158114,m475,playback,L446770,u7088,BETTY,Your family coat of arms Mr. Killaine?,840
158115,m475,playback,L446766,u7095,KILLAINE,There's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.,840
158116,m475,playback,L446765,u7088,BETTY,Who told you I was married?,840
158117,m475,playback,L446764,u7095,KILLAINE,Well that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?,840
158118,m475,playback,L446738,u7088,BETTY,It is?,840
158119,m475,playback,L446737,u7095,KILLAINE,That's an evasion and you know it.,840
158120,m475,playback,L446736,u7088,BETTY,You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.,840
158121,m475,playback,L446735,u7095,KILLAINE,Please answer my question.,840
158122,m475,playback,L446734,u7095,KILLAINE,Miss Mayfield the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?,840
158123,m475,playback,L446733,u7088,BETTY,I'm sorry that's all there is.,840
158124,m475,playback,L446732,u7095,KILLAINE,I'll have to know a little more than that.,840
158125,m475,playback,L446731,u7088,BETTY,I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.,840
158126,m475,playback,L446730,u7095,KILLAINE,You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes and money and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself Miss Mayfield.,840
158127,m475,playback,L446729,u7088,BETTY,I don't know her.. or particularly want to.,840
158128,m475,playback,L446728,u7095,KILLAINE,Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.,840
158129,m475,playback,L446894,u7089,BRANDON,This way.,840
158131,m475,playback,L446889,u7089,BRANDON,Who's Goble?,840
158133,m475,playback,L446887,u7089,BRANDON,All right. Get him.,840
158135,m475,playback,L446885,u7089,BRANDON,Morning. Any calls?,840
158138,m475,playback,L446927,u7089,BRANDON,I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.,840
158140,m475,playback,L446925,u7089,BRANDON,There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night,840
158142,m475,playback,L446923,u7089,BRANDON,Got the information on you?,840
158144,m475,playback,L446921,u7089,BRANDON,A thousand.,840
158146,m475,playback,L446919,u7089,BRANDON,You mentioned information.,840
158148,m475,playback,L446917,u7089,BRANDON,For two hundred?,840
158150,m475,playback,L446915,u7089,BRANDON,For five hundred what do I get?,840
158152,m475,playback,L446913,u7089,BRANDON,If I call the police your price will go down to a minus sign.,840
158154,m475,playback,L446911,u7089,BRANDON,I don't know whether to knock your teeth down your throat--or call the police--or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose.,840
158156,m475,playback,L446909,u7089,BRANDON,That's a nice hard knee you've got Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?,840
158158,m475,playback,L446907,u7089,BRANDON,What have you got on Miss Mayfield?,840
158160,m475,playback,L446905,u7089,BRANDON,What are your rates?,840
158162,m475,playback,L446903,u7089,BRANDON,Private eye?,840
158164,m475,playback,L446901,u7089,BRANDON,Name it.,840
158166,m475,playback,L446899,u7089,BRANDON,I'm still asking. What do you want?,840
158168,m475,playback,L446897,u7089,BRANDON,Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.,840
158169,m475,playback,L446892,u7089,BRANDON,I'm not interested in blind dates.,840
158172,m475,playback,L446667,u7089,BRANDON,Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.,840
158175,m475,playback,L446661,u7089,BRANDON,Leave that one lay.,840
158177,m475,playback,L446659,u7089,BRANDON,Sometimes.,840
158179,m475,playback,L446524,u7089,BRANDON,You Killaine?,840
158181,m475,playback,L446522,u7089,BRANDON,What'll you have Margo?,840
158183,m475,playback,L446520,u7089,BRANDON,Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine Mrs. West.,840
158185,m475,playback,L446518,u7089,BRANDON,Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?,840
158186,m475,playback,L446848,u7089,BRANDON,I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells I don't like you.,840
158189,m475,playback,L446845,u7089,BRANDON,How are your teeth getting along?,840
158191,m475,playback,L446843,u7089,BRANDON,Who told you my name?,840
158193,m475,playback,L446841,u7089,BRANDON,So you're not a cop.,840
158195,m475,playback,L446839,u7089,BRANDON,All right let's see the buzzer.,840
158196,m475,playback,L447211,u7095,KILLAINE,Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.,840
158197,m475,playback,L447210,u7089,BRANDON,You asked me where it all came from.,840
158198,m475,playback,L447209,u7095,KILLAINE,What?,840
158199,m475,playback,L447208,u7089,BRANDON,I had a father who knew how to steal.,840
158200,m475,playback,L447207,u7095,KILLAINE,Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?,840
158201,m475,playback,L447206,u7089,BRANDON,I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.,840
158202,m475,playback,L447205,u7095,KILLAINE,I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.,840
158203,m475,playback,L447204,u7089,BRANDON,Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.,840
158204,m475,playback,L447203,u7095,KILLAINE,You do a lot of real estate trading Brandon?,840
158205,m475,playback,L447202,u7089,BRANDON,Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.,840
158206,m475,playback,L447201,u7095,KILLAINE,I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.,840
158207,m475,playback,L447200,u7089,BRANDON,You forgetting the gag line Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.,840
158208,m475,playback,L447198,u7089,BRANDON,Where would she go anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.,840
158209,m475,playback,L447197,u7095,KILLAINE,No more for me thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.,840
158210,m475,playback,L447181,u7089,BRANDON,No idea.,840
158211,m475,playback,L447180,u7095,KILLAINE,You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?,840
158212,m475,playback,L447179,u7089,BRANDON,Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale Killaine.,840
158213,m475,playback,L447178,u7095,KILLAINE,Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself then wandered out on this balcony then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.,840
158214,m475,playback,L447177,u7089,BRANDON,Mitchell was too drunk.,840
158215,m475,playback,L447176,u7095,KILLAINE,She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.,840
158216,m475,playback,L447175,u7089,BRANDON,How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here is it likely she'd let him in?,840
158217,m475,playback,L447174,u7095,KILLAINE,Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.,840
158218,m475,playback,L447173,u7089,BRANDON,And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive too.  Margo and her money.,840
158219,m475,playback,L447172,u7089,BRANDON,Your concentrating too hard Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?,840
158220,m475,playback,L447171,u7095,KILLAINE,Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.,840
158221,m475,playback,L447170,u7089,BRANDON,That COULD BE TOLD.,840
158222,m475,playback,L447169,u7095,KILLAINE,It could have been an accident.,840
158223,m475,playback,L447168,u7089,BRANDON,Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.,840
158224,m475,playback,L447167,u7095,KILLAINE,Information.,840
158225,m475,playback,L447166,u7089,BRANDON,You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?,840
158226,m475,playback,L447165,u7095,KILLAINE,The only answer I have for you.,840
158227,m475,playback,L447164,u7089,BRANDON,Doesn't answer the question.,840
158228,m475,playback,L447163,u7095,KILLAINE,You'd be breaking the law.,840
158229,m475,playback,L447162,u7089,BRANDON,Would that make me a heel?,840
158230,m475,playback,L447161,u7095,KILLAINE,I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--,840
158231,m475,playback,L447160,u7089,BRANDON,That must hurt.,840
158232,m475,playback,L447159,u7095,KILLAINE,I have a warrant for her arrest.,840
158233,m475,playback,L447158,u7089,BRANDON,A couple of hours.,840
158234,m475,playback,L447157,u7095,KILLAINE,Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?,840
158235,m475,playback,L447156,u7089,BRANDON,Could we discuss that some other time?,840
158236,m475,playback,L447154,u7089,BRANDON,I wouldn't know.,840
158237,m475,playback,L447153,u7095,KILLAINE,I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?,840
158238,m475,playback,L447152,u7089,BRANDON,I never notice the view after the first week.,840
158239,m475,playback,L447151,u7095,KILLAINE,Thanks.  Lovely view you have haven't you?,840
158240,m475,playback,L447149,u7095,KILLAINE,Thanks.  I don't mind.,840
158241,m475,playback,L447148,u7089,BRANDON,If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?,840
158242,m475,playback,L447147,u7095,KILLAINE,Time for a little chat?,840
158243,m475,playback,L446807,u7089,BRANDON,Well--good night.,840
158244,m475,playback,L446806,u7095,KILLAINE,I don't.,840
158245,m475,playback,L446805,u7089,BRANDON,In case you want to have us followed.,840
158246,m475,playback,L446784,u7095,KILLAINE,Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something I know less than I did before.  Well I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.,840
158247,m475,playback,L446783,u7089,BRANDON,How are you two getting along?,840
158248,m475,playback,L446726,u7095,KILLAINE,No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for say half and hour?,840
158249,m475,playback,L446725,u7089,BRANDON,How about a cup of coffee?,840
158250,m475,playback,L446713,u7095,KILLAINE,We do when we get the chance.,840
158251,m475,playback,L446712,u7089,BRANDON,Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens one doesn't use a tape measure.,840
158252,m475,playback,L446711,u7095,KILLAINE,It was lying where on the balcony?,840
158253,m475,playback,L446710,u7089,BRANDON,No.,840
158254,m475,playback,L446709,u7095,KILLAINE,I rather thought so. And before that had you ever seen the gun?,840
158255,m475,playback,L446708,u7089,BRANDON,Could be.,840
158256,m475,playback,L446707,u7095,KILLAINE,Quite sure you had no motive?,840
158257,m475,playback,L446706,u7089,BRANDON,On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.,840
158258,m475,playback,L446705,u7095,KILLAINE,Where?,840
158259,m475,playback,L446704,u7089,BRANDON,Yes I've seen it before.,840
158260,m475,playback,L446703,u7095,KILLAINE,Thank you.,840
158261,m475,playback,L446580,u7089,BRANDON,That's what I thought at first.  Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party.  With my liquor of course.,840
158262,m475,playback,L446579,u7095,KILLAINE,She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.,840
158263,m475,playback,L446578,u7089,BRANDON,Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.,840
158264,m475,playback,L446577,u7095,KILLAINE,Hardly. Who's the girl?,840
158265,m475,playback,L446576,u7089,BRANDON,Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?,840
158266,m475,playback,L446544,u7095,KILLAINE,If I can get off.,840
158267,m475,playback,L446543,u7089,BRANDON,Round of golf Saturday?,840
158268,m475,playback,L446542,u7095,KILLAINE,The usual grind.,840
158269,m475,playback,L446541,u7089,BRANDON,How's life treating you?,840
158270,m475,playback,L446540,u7095,KILLAINE,That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.,840
158271,m475,playback,L446530,u7089,BRANDON,You're not English.,840
158272,m475,playback,L446529,u7095,KILLAINE,It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.,840
158273,m475,playback,L446528,u7095,KILLAINE,A private joke.,840
158274,m475,playback,L446527,u7089,BRANDON,What?,840
158275,m475,playback,L446566,u7089,BRANDON,Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.,840
158277,m475,playback,L446564,u7089,BRANDON,Want to walk out... or get thrown out?,840
158279,m475,playback,L446562,u7089,BRANDON,I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.,840
158281,m475,playback,L446560,u7089,BRANDON,Do me a favor Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.,840
158283,m475,playback,L446497,u7089,BRANDON,Lay off can't you?,840
158286,m475,playback,L446494,u7089,BRANDON,Hello Mitchell. Having fun?,840
158321,m475,playback,L446714,u7095,KILLAINE,I needn't keep you any longer Mr. Clarendon.,840
158322,m475,playback,L446699,u7095,KILLAINE,Thank you.,840
158324,m475,playback,L446697,u7095,KILLAINE,Recently then.,840
158326,m475,playback,L446695,u7095,KILLAINE,Mr. Clarendon have you ever seen this before?,840
158327,m475,playback,L447401,u7095,KILLAINE,We don't need him.,840
158329,m475,playback,L447399,u7095,KILLAINE,What's the face for Driscoll?,840
158330,m475,playback,L447146,u7095,KILLAINE,Men like you don't need orders.,840
158332,m475,playback,L447144,u7095,KILLAINE,The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.,840
158334,m475,playback,L447142,u7095,KILLAINE,Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.,840
158336,m475,playback,L447140,u7095,KILLAINE,Would you?,840
158338,m475,playback,L447138,u7095,KILLAINE,I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble address so-and-so has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner name something-something Greer refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll Vancouver British Columbia Police. ,840
158340,m475,playback,L447136,u7095,KILLAINE,I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.,840
158342,m475,playback,L447134,u7095,KILLAINE,Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.,840
158345,m475,playback,L447131,u7095,KILLAINE,I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.,840
158348,m475,playback,L447034,u7095,KILLAINE,And don't get too logical Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't,840
158349,m475,playback,L447033,u7095,KILLAINE,Let me know when you've identified him,840
158351,m475,playback,L447031,u7095,KILLAINE,Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.,840
158353,m475,playback,L447029,u7095,KILLAINE,You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.,840
158355,m475,playback,L447027,u7095,KILLAINE,Floater?,840
158371,m475,playback,L447341,u7095,KILLAINE,A think wire---but very very strong.  Let's get out of here.,840
158373,m475,playback,L447338,u7095,KILLAINE,And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.,840
158375,m475,playback,L447336,u7095,KILLAINE,Did we ever really think it was suicide?,840
158377,m475,playback,L447334,u7095,KILLAINE,If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.,840
158379,m475,playback,L447332,u7095,KILLAINE,He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark listening he'd know when she came home know when she found Mitchell dead know what she did about it.  If she telephoned he'd probably hear that.,840
158382,m475,playback,L447329,u7095,KILLAINE,So?,840
158384,m475,playback,L447327,u7095,KILLAINE,Well.  What about it?,840
158386,m475,playback,L447322,u7095,KILLAINE,You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.,840
158388,m475,playback,L447320,u7095,KILLAINE,You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.,840
158390,m475,playback,L447318,u7095,KILLAINE,You can find out.,840
158392,m475,playback,L447316,u7095,KILLAINE,Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?,840
158394,m475,playback,L447314,u7095,KILLAINE,Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life rob me of my friends my position.,840
158396,m475,playback,L447312,u7095,KILLAINE,They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?,840
158398,m475,playback,L447310,u7095,KILLAINE,You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?,840
158400,m475,playback,L447306,u7095,KILLAINE,Where's the shell?,840
158402,m475,playback,L447304,u7095,KILLAINE,Was that about the right angle?,840
158403,m475,playback,L447301,u7095,KILLAINE,There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.,840
158405,m475,playback,L447299,u7095,KILLAINE,Not too hard is it?,840
158406,m475,playback,L447297,u7095,KILLAINE,Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.,840
158408,m475,playback,L447280,u7095,KILLAINE,Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.,840
158411,m475,playback,L447275,u7095,KILLAINE,I'll know when I find it.,840
158413,m475,playback,L446691,u7095,KILLAINE,I've always looked forward to it. All right let's get him out of here and tidy up.,840
158415,m475,playback,L446689,u7095,KILLAINE,So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.,840
158417,m475,playback,L446687,u7095,KILLAINE,So the shell ought to have gone over?,840
158420,m475,playback,L446681,u7095,KILLAINE,Pearl-handled .25 Automatic uh?  No it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.,840
158422,m475,playback,L446679,u7095,KILLAINE,I've met her.,840
158425,m475,playback,L446676,u7095,KILLAINE,I knew him. He was easy to dislike poor chap.,840
158427,m475,playback,L446673,u7095,KILLAINE,So it seems Sergeant.,840
158429,m475,playback,L447002,u7095,KILLAINE,You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning Mrs. West.,840
158431,m475,playback,L447000,u7095,KILLAINE,Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.,840
158433,m475,playback,L446998,u7095,KILLAINE,Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.,840
158435,m475,playback,L446996,u7095,KILLAINE,I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--,840
158437,m475,playback,L446994,u7095,KILLAINE,Not if it clears the air.,840
158439,m475,playback,L446992,u7095,KILLAINE,Mortar shells are not funny either.,840
158441,m475,playback,L446990,u7095,KILLAINE,You didn't play it for laughs last night.,840
158443,m475,playback,L446988,u7095,KILLAINE,That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell weren't you?,840
158445,m475,playback,L446986,u7095,KILLAINE,Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.,840
158448,m475,playback,L446983,u7095,KILLAINE,Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.,840
158450,m475,playback,L446981,u7095,KILLAINE,Remember that time didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?,840
158451,m475,playback,L446724,u7095,KILLAINE,Thank you very much Mrs. West.,840
158453,m475,playback,L446722,u7095,KILLAINE,Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?,840
158455,m475,playback,L446720,u7095,KILLAINE,I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?,840
158457,m475,playback,L446718,u7095,KILLAINE,You knew Mitchell pretty well didn't you Mrs. West?,840
158458,m475,playback,L446717,u7095,KILLAINE,Not quiet yet.,840
158460,m475,playback,L446702,u7095,KILLAINE,Positive?,840
158463,m475,playback,L446525,u7095,KILLAINE,Scotch and plain water I think.,840
158465,m475,playback,L446516,u7095,KILLAINE,Oh nothing.,840
158467,m475,playback,L446512,u7095,KILLAINE,I never wear a hat.  Oh so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again Mrs. West.,840
158470,m475,playback,L447397,u7095,KILLAINE,The card says so doesn't it?,840
158472,m475,playback,L447392,u7095,KILLAINE,I'll take your word.,840
158474,m475,playback,L447390,u7095,KILLAINE,She might.,840
158476,m475,playback,L447388,u7095,KILLAINE,Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.,840
158478,m475,playback,L447386,u7095,KILLAINE,That leaves two strangers.,840
158480,m475,playback,L447384,u7095,KILLAINE,How about Magruder?,840
158483,m475,playback,L447380,u7095,KILLAINE,I'm interested in who handled it.,840
158486,m475,playback,L447125,u7095,KILLAINE,What are my orders sir?,840
158489,m475,playback,L447122,u7095,KILLAINE,Not too far I hope.,840
158491,m475,playback,L447120,u7095,KILLAINE,Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.,840
158493,m475,playback,L447118,u7095,KILLAINE,Two.,840
158495,m475,playback,L447115,u7095,KILLAINE,I do.,840
158497,m475,playback,L447113,u7095,KILLAINE,I think you'd be entirely justified sir.,840
158498,m475,playback,L447110,u7095,KILLAINE,Identification on possible Sir. Not conclusive.,840
158499,m475,playback,L447108,u7095,KILLAINE,Yes sir.,840
158501,m475,playback,L447106,u7095,KILLAINE,We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.,840
158503,m475,playback,L447104,u7095,KILLAINE,I disagree sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion the right to act on it.,840
158505,m475,playback,L447102,u7095,KILLAINE,Nobody's covering her I detached the officer assigned to that duty.,840
158507,m475,playback,L447100,u7095,KILLAINE,I don't know sir.,840
158509,m475,playback,L447098,u7095,KILLAINE,A little of both sir and perhaps not quiet enough of either.,840
158512,m475,playback,L447020,u7095,KILLAINE,Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?,840
158514,m475,playback,L447016,u7095,KILLAINE,Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.,840
158516,m475,playback,L447014,u7095,KILLAINE,No.,840
158518,m475,playback,L447010,u7095,KILLAINE,She's a suspect naturally.  But not the only one.,840
158520,m475,playback,L447008,u7095,KILLAINE,How do you do sir.,840
167832,m513,shampoo,L501325,u7588,GEORGE,Well it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?,1160

168859,m513,shampoo,L501240,u7594,JILL,I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.,1160

168876,m513,shampoo,L500930,u7593,JACKIE,I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?,1160
168877,m513,shampoo,L500929,u7594,JILL,I know I'm sorry.,1160

172254,m522,some like it hot,L521823,u7722,SUGAR,I didn't do anything.  It just happened.,1063
172255,m522,some like it hot,L521822,u7713,JOE,Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.,1063

172264,m522,some like it hot,L521811,u7713,JOE,According to our tax advisers she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -,1063

172277,m522,some like it hot,L521798,u7722,SUGAR,That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs and I sorted your shells and mixed your cocktails and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up I felt like swimming right back to you.,1063
172278,m522,some like it hot,L521706,u7722,SUGAR,Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.,1063

172294,m522,some like it hot,L521640,u7713,JOE,Where did you learn to kiss like that?,1063
172295,m522,some like it hot,L521639,u7722,SUGAR,Mineral baths - now really!,1063
172296,m522,some like it hot,L521638,u7713,JOE,They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.,1063

172301,m522,some like it hot,L521633,u7722,SUGAR,Lets throw another log on the fire.,1063
172302,m522,some like it hot,L521632,u7713,JOE,I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.,1063
172303,m522,some like it hot,L521631,u7713,JOE,I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.,1063

172324,m522,some like it hot,L521606,u7713,JOE,My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!,1063
172325,m522,some like it hot,L521605,u7722,SUGAR,Is it that hopeless?,1063

172330,m522,some like it hot,L521600,u7713,JOE,Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.,1063

172332,m522,some like it hot,L521598,u7713,JOE,Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.,1063
172333,m522,some like it hot,L521597,u7722,SUGAR,Oh no!,1063
172334,m522,some like it hot,L521596,u7713,JOE,Well it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -,1063

172340,m522,some like it hot,L521590,u7713,JOE,Oh it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.,1063
172341,m522,some like it hot,L521589,u7722,SUGAR,That makes me feel just awful.,1063
172342,m522,some like it hot,L521588,u7713,JOE,Complete washout.,1063
172343,m522,some like it hot,L521587,u7722,SUGAR,Nothing at all?,1063

172347,m522,some like it hot,L521583,u7713,JOE,It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls it does nothing to me.,1063

172356,m522,some like it hot,L521574,u7722,SUGAR,It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.,1063
172357,m522,some like it hot,L521573,u7713,JOE,Oh it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.,1063
172358,m522,some like it hot,L521572,u7722,SUGAR,You know I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.,1063

172491,m522,some like it hot,L521327,u7713,JOE,Because usually when people find out who I am they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.,1063
172492,m522,some like it hot,L521326,u7722,SUGAR,Why?,1063

172503,m522,some like it hot,L521245,u7722,SUGAR,What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.,1063

173898,m528,sphere,L527488,u7811,NORMAN,At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring.,1012
173899,m528,sphere,L527487,u7805,BARNES,If something should happen to us the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.,1012
173900,m528,sphere,L527486,u7811,NORMAN,What for?,1012
173901,m528,sphere,L527454,u7805,BARNES,Edmunds?  Can you copy?,1012
173902,m528,sphere,L527453,u7811,NORMAN,... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?,1012
173903,m528,sphere,L527452,u7805,BARNES,Damn it Edmunds?,1012
173904,m528,sphere,L527451,u7811,NORMAN,Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...,1012
173905,m528,sphere,L527450,u7805,BARNES,Edmunds?,1012
173906,m528,sphere,L527422,u7811,NORMAN,I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.,1012
173907,m528,sphere,L527421,u7805,BARNES,You don't think weapons are important?,1012
173908,m528,sphere,L527420,u7811,NORMAN,That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.,1012
173909,m528,sphere,L527419,u7805,BARNES,Great okay.  Ask him about his weapons.,1012
173910,m528,sphere,L527379,u7805,BARNES,What am I -- a dog now?,1012
173911,m528,sphere,L527378,u7811,NORMAN,The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand letting it sniff get used to you.,1012
173912,m528,sphere,L527337,u7811,NORMAN,-- I didn't know it would come to this --,1012
173913,m528,sphere,L527336,u7805,BARNES,-- and then brought her down here --,1012

173915,m528,sphere,L527334,u7805,BARNES,You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --,1012
173916,m528,sphere,L527333,u7811,NORMAN,At the time I don't know I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.,1012
173917,m528,sphere,L527332,u7805,BARNES,So you knew this when you wrote your report?,1012
173918,m528,sphere,L527331,u7811,NORMAN,'81 I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.,1012

173920,m528,sphere,L527329,u7811,NORMAN,She put a razor to her wrists a day later.,1012
173921,m528,sphere,L527328,u7805,BARNES,She should've known better.,1012
173922,m528,sphere,L527327,u7811,NORMAN,A while back Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah I know.  And when she finished her work he kicked her out broke off the relationship and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.,1012
173923,m528,sphere,L527326,u7805,BARNES,I think I do.,1012
173924,m528,sphere,L527325,u7811,NORMAN,You don't want to know.,1012
173925,m528,sphere,L527324,u7805,BARNES,How drastic?,1012
173926,m528,sphere,L527323,u7811,NORMAN,I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.,1012
173927,m528,sphere,L527181,u7811,NORMAN,But sir --,1012
173928,m528,sphere,L527180,u7805,BARNES,I told you people nobody goes anywhere unless I say.,1012

173931,m528,sphere,L527160,u7811,NORMAN,He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.,1012
173932,m528,sphere,L527159,u7805,BARNES,What do you mean he's missing?,1012
173933,m528,sphere,L527158,u7811,NORMAN,Harry's missing.,1012
173934,m528,sphere,L527152,u7805,BARNES,Just worry about yourself.,1012
173935,m528,sphere,L527151,u7811,NORMAN,All I'm saying is someone should keep an eye on him.,1012
173936,m528,sphere,L527150,u7805,BARNES,Look the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there if it's that imprtant.,1012
173937,m528,sphere,L527149,u7811,NORMAN,I'm telling you Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.,1012
173938,m528,sphere,L527148,u7805,BARNES,Don't get hysterical Norman.,1012
173939,m528,sphere,L527108,u7805,BARNES,Everything can be killed.,1012
173940,m528,sphere,L527107,u7811,NORMAN,I don't know.  That's the point.,1012
173941,m528,sphere,L527106,u7805,BARNES,You mean what's in that thing is immortal?,1012
173942,m528,sphere,L527105,u7811,NORMAN,Or maybe it can't <u>be</u> killed.,1012
173943,m528,sphere,L527095,u7811,NORMAN,If it is alien maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.,1012
173944,m528,sphere,L527094,u7805,BARNES,What?,1012
173945,m528,sphere,L527093,u7811,NORMAN,Maybe we shouldn't.,1012
173946,m528,sphere,L527076,u7805,BARNES,I don't know.  But it's something alien.,1012

173948,m528,sphere,L526977,u7811,NORMAN,Take a look.,1012
173949,m528,sphere,L526976,u7805,BARNES,What is it Norman?,1012
173950,m528,sphere,L526921,u7805,BARNES,It's a corrosive gas.  On earth it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly iron rust on an Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it down here and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile.,1012
173951,m528,sphere,L526920,u7811,NORMAN,What's wrong with oxygen?,1012
173952,m528,sphere,L526919,u7805,BARNES,They pressurize us with helium.,1012
173953,m528,sphere,L526843,u7811,NORMAN,But sir I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.,1012
173954,m528,sphere,L526842,u7805,BARNES,Your report's become our bible down here Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.,1012
173955,m528,sphere,L526841,u7811,NORMAN,ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?,1012
173956,m528,sphere,L526840,u7805,BARNES,The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.,1012
173957,m528,sphere,L526839,u7811,NORMAN,What team?,1012
173958,m528,sphere,L526838,u7805,BARNES,We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.,1012
173959,m528,sphere,L526837,u7811,NORMAN,It doesn't make any sense.,1012
173960,m528,sphere,L526836,u7805,BARNES,Off the record I don't mind telling you this thing scares the shit out of me.,1012
173961,m528,sphere,L526835,u7805,BARNES,I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.,1012
173962,m528,sphere,L526834,u7811,NORMAN,It's impossible.,1012
173963,m528,sphere,L526833,u7805,BARNES,Extraordinary isn't it?,1012
173964,m528,sphere,L526832,u7811,NORMAN,-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.,1012
173965,m528,sphere,L526831,u7805,BARNES,Maybe older --,1012
173966,m528,sphere,L526830,u7811,NORMAN,Hold on --,1012
173967,m528,sphere,L526829,u7805,BARNES,-- dating the crash at least that old.,1012

173971,m528,sphere,L526825,u7805,BARNES,See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.,1012
173972,m528,sphere,L526823,u7805,BARNES,As best we can estimate it crashed four hundred years ago.,1012
173973,m528,sphere,L526822,u7811,NORMAN,Not really no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?,1012
173974,m528,sphere,L526821,u7805,BARNES,Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?,1012
173975,m528,sphere,L526820,u7811,NORMAN,What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?,1012
173976,m528,sphere,L526817,u7811,NORMAN,What do you need me for?,1012
173977,m528,sphere,L526816,u7805,BARNES,What?,1012
173978,m528,sphere,L526815,u7811,NORMAN,Then why am I here?,1012
173979,m528,sphere,L526814,u7805,BARNES,Survivors?  No I wouldn't think so.,1012
173980,m528,sphere,L526813,u7811,NORMAN,A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here but I assume there are no survivors.,1012

174293,m528,sphere,L527740,u7811,NORMAN,No.  I mean we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature you know?

How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...,1012

187213,m570,three kings,L610251,u8408,EPPS,Where were you going?,733
187215,m570,three kings,L610249,u8408,EPPS,You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?,733
187216,m570,three kings,L610201,u8408,EPPS,It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well do you?,733
187217,m570,three kings,L610200,u8410,WES,Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who don't we Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.,733
187218,m570,three kings,L610198,u8408,EPPS,If I give it to you will you let us go?,733
187219,m570,three kings,L610197,u8410,WES,Give it to me!,733
187220,m570,three kings,L610184,u8410,WES,If I don't answer he'll know something's up.,733
187221,m570,three kings,L610183,u8408,EPPS,So you can give us away?,733
187222,m570,three kings,L610182,u8410,WES,I have to answer him.,733
187223,m570,three kings,L610181,u8408,EPPS,Just keep quiet.,733
187224,m570,three kings,L610177,u8408,EPPS,You don't know John Epps very well do you?,733
187225,m570,three kings,L610176,u8410,WES,They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.,733
187226,m570,three kings,L610169,u8410,WES,That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that.  It doesn't change me respecting you.  And now you let me down.  I expected more from you you know?  I really did.  I expected you to--,733
187227,m570,three kings,L610168,u8408,EPPS,That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.,733
187228,m570,three kings,L610167,u8410,WES,You disappoint me Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.,733
187229,m570,three kings,L610164,u8408,EPPS,Tell me something Wes.  Are you crazy greedy or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.,733
187230,m570,three kings,L610163,u8410,WES,Thanks for taking care of this for me.,733
187231,m570,three kings,L610160,u8410,WES,Look I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?,733
187232,m570,three kings,L610159,u8408,EPPS,Wes--,733
187233,m570,three kings,L610158,u8410,WES,Sure and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.,733
187234,m570,three kings,L610157,u8408,EPPS,Wes we thought you were dead and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.,733
187235,m570,three kings,L610152,u8408,EPPS,We thought--,733
187236,m570,three kings,L610151,u8410,WES,In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.,733
187237,m570,three kings,L610009,u8410,WES,Nothing about him unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.,733
187238,m570,three kings,L610008,u8408,EPPS,What about Jaeger?,733
187239,m570,three kings,L610007,u8410,WES,Then I suppose it'd be insurrection and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.,733
187240,m570,three kings,L610006,u8408,EPPS,Suppose I don't go for that?,733
187241,m570,three kings,L610005,u8410,WES,I'm the one's got the big stick.,733
187242,m570,three kings,L610004,u8408,EPPS,And let me guess who is.,733
187243,m570,three kings,L610003,u8410,WES,Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.,733
187244,m570,three kings,L610002,u8408,EPPS,Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.,733
187245,m570,three kings,L610001,u8410,WES,No navicom.  A lot of good you are now Epps.,733
187246,m570,three kings,L609978,u8410,WES,What if I do?,733
187247,m570,three kings,L609977,u8408,EPPS,We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...,733
187248,m570,three kings,L609976,u8410,WES,In the service you do but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it what we're doing that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.,733
187249,m570,three kings,L609975,u8408,EPPS,I out rank you that's why.,733
187250,m570,three kings,L609974,u8410,WES,You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.,733
187251,m570,three kings,L609961,u8410,WES,Get out of my way.,733
187252,m570,three kings,L609960,u8408,EPPS,No.,733
187253,m570,three kings,L609959,u8410,WES,Then step aside.,733
187254,m570,three kings,L609958,u8408,EPPS,It's murder and I won't be any part of it.,733
187255,m570,three kings,L609957,u8410,WES,It's a combat action.,733
187256,m570,three kings,L609956,u8408,EPPS,I've got no stomach for murder.,733
187257,m570,three kings,L609955,u8410,WES,I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.,733
187258,m570,three kings,L609953,u8410,WES,He tried to kill us.  If not just now then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.,733
187259,m570,three kings,L609952,u8408,EPPS,We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--,733
187260,m570,three kings,L609951,u8410,WES,We're at war.,733
187261,m570,three kings,L609950,u8408,EPPS,I'm not going to let you kill him.,733
187262,m570,three kings,L609949,u8410,WES,He's an enemy soldier.,733
187263,m570,three kings,L609948,u8408,EPPS,You're out of your mind.,733
187264,m570,three kings,L609944,u8410,WES,You don't know he isn't.,733
187265,m570,three kings,L609943,u8408,EPPS,You don't know that.,733
187266,m570,three kings,L609942,u8410,WES,That's what he says.  He could be a spy or something.,733
187267,m570,three kings,L609941,u8408,EPPS,You said he was a deserter.,733
187268,m570,three kings,L609940,u8410,WES,We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit report our position...,733
187269,m570,three kings,L609938,u8408,EPPS,Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.,733
187270,m570,three kings,L609937,u8410,WES,I don't care what he says he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.,733
187271,m570,three kings,L609932,u8410,WES,He...he could have been watching us.,733
187272,m570,three kings,L609931,u8408,EPPS,How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.,733
187273,m570,three kings,L609930,u8410,WES,Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.,733
187274,m570,three kings,L609929,u8408,EPPS,Why'd he come in our camp.,733
187275,m570,three kings,L609928,u8410,WES,Says they were deserters they were afraid to fight don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them so they shot first.,733
187276,m570,three kings,L609924,u8410,WES,I told you; don't push me around.,733
187277,m570,three kings,L609923,u8408,EPPS,Stop it!,733
187278,m570,three kings,L609919,u8410,WES,I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.,733
187279,m570,three kings,L609918,u8408,EPPS,What happened?,733
187280,m570,three kings,L609917,u8408,EPPS,Get off him!,733
187281,m570,three kings,L609916,u8410,WES,He snuck in here thinking we were asleep only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.,733
187282,m570,three kings,L609915,u8408,EPPS,Get off him.,733
187283,m570,three kings,L609910,u8408,EPPS,Then get up and do something about it.,733
187284,m570,three kings,L609909,u8410,WES,You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.,733
187285,m570,three kings,L609907,u8408,EPPS,I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?,733
187286,m570,three kings,L609906,u8410,WES,You got no reason to do that!,733
187287,m570,three kings,L609905,u8410,WES,Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own.,733
187288,m570,three kings,L609904,u8408,EPPS,Maybe I do.,733
187289,m570,three kings,L609903,u8410,WES,Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.,733
187290,m570,three kings,L609902,u8408,EPPS,You've had your say Wes.  Now leave it.,733
187291,m570,three kings,L609901,u8410,WES,You're the one with all the ideas.,733
187292,m570,three kings,L609898,u8410,WES,What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.,733
187293,m570,three kings,L609897,u8408,EPPS,We started this together and we're staying together so there's no point in splitting things up now.,733
187294,m570,three kings,L609896,u8410,WES,Maybe we should split it up now.,733
187295,m570,three kings,L609895,u8408,EPPS,What about it?,733
187296,m570,three kings,L609894,u8410,WES,What about the gold?,733
187297,m570,three kings,L609893,u8408,EPPS,It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.,733
187298,m570,three kings,L609874,u8408,EPPS,All right.  I'll go up then you send up the gold and--,733
187299,m570,three kings,L609873,u8410,WES,You ready?,733
187300,m570,three kings,L609866,u8410,WES,Ready when you are.,733
187301,m570,three kings,L609865,u8408,EPPS,I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up then me and Jaeger'll climb back.,733
187302,m570,three kings,L609832,u8408,EPPS,I heard!,733
187303,m570,three kings,L609831,u8410,WES,Epps!,733
187304,m570,three kings,L609820,u8408,EPPS,Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.,733
187305,m570,three kings,L609819,u8410,WES,What am I supposed to do?,733
187306,m570,three kings,L609818,u8408,EPPS,All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels lanterns and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down and see what we can see.,733
187307,m570,three kings,L609804,u8408,EPPS,Move!,733
187308,m570,three kings,L609803,u8410,WES,Missile!,733
187309,m570,three kings,L609800,u8408,EPPS,So we wait.,733
187310,m570,three kings,L609799,u8410,WES,And they can't fly around out there forever.,733
187311,m570,three kings,L609786,u8410,WES,Weird they didn't chase us.,733
187312,m570,three kings,L609785,u8408,EPPS,I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--,733
187313,m570,three kings,L609784,u8410,WES,Where'd they go?,733
187314,m570,three kings,L609779,u8408,EPPS,Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--,733
187315,m570,three kings,L609778,u8410,WES,Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.,733
187316,m570,three kings,L609773,u8408,EPPS,Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.,733
187317,m570,three kings,L609772,u8410,WES,What do you figure it to be?,733
187318,m570,three kings,L609771,u8408,EPPS,Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.,733
187319,m570,three kings,L609770,u8408,EPPS,Let me see the map.,733
187320,m570,three kings,L609769,u8410,WES,The US Army:  Always an adventure.,733
187321,m570,three kings,L609765,u8408,EPPS,Picks up again just on the other side.,733
187322,m570,three kings,L609764,u8410,WES,Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.,733
187323,m570,three kings,L609763,u8408,EPPS,Not much of a pass.,733
187324,m570,three kings,L609762,u8408,EPPS,We're not going to find anything standing here.  Let's get to climbing.,733
187325,m570,three kings,L609761,u8410,WES,And find the treasure and get it and get back to the Humvee and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off but that's about it.,733
187326,m570,three kings,L609760,u8408,EPPS,All we've got to do is make it to the top.,733
187327,m570,three kings,L609758,u8408,EPPS,There's nothing we can do.  We shouldn't even be here in the first place.,733
187328,m570,three kings,L609757,u8410,WES,We can't just go off and--,733
187329,m570,three kings,L609756,u8408,EPPS,I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die and all we do is die.,733
187330,m570,three kings,L609746,u8410,WES,We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites and the Khurds.,733
187331,m570,three kings,L609745,u8408,EPPS,There's nothing we can do.,733
187332,m570,three kings,L609742,u8410,WES,The soldiers are going to kill those people!,733
187333,m570,three kings,L609741,u8408,EPPS,All right.  Let's get out of here.,733
187334,m570,three kings,L609692,u8410,WES,Yeah.,733
187335,m570,three kings,L609691,u8408,EPPS,Ready?,733
187336,m570,three kings,L609690,u8410,WES,Should have at least gotten the map off of him.  Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.,733
187337,m570,three kings,L609689,u8408,EPPS,You just go when I say go.,733
187338,m570,three kings,L609688,u8410,WES,What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground explode in the air kill him and us.,733
187339,m570,three kings,L609676,u8408,EPPS,Break it out.,733
187340,m570,three kings,L609675,u8410,WES,For climbing.,733
187341,m570,three kings,L609674,u8408,EPPS,We've got rope?,733
187342,m570,three kings,L609666,u8408,EPPS,Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.,733
187343,m570,three kings,L609665,u8410,WES,Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse that's Vietnam stuff.,733
187344,m570,three kings,L609664,u8408,EPPS,I don't know and I wasn't about to mess with it.,733
187345,m570,three kings,L609663,u8410,WES,What kind of mine?,733
187346,m570,three kings,L609631,u8408,EPPS,How tough you have to be to make the army?  All you've got to do is shoot a gun and stop a bullet.,733
187347,m570,three kings,L609630,u8410,WES,He's an idiot and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.,733
187348,m570,three kings,L609629,u8408,EPPS,He's not so--,733
187349,m570,three kings,L609628,u8410,WES,Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.,733
187350,m570,three kings,L609627,u8408,EPPS,Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.,733
187351,m570,three kings,L609599,u8410,WES,Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.,733
187352,m570,three kings,L609598,u8408,EPPS,You two fighting's not going to get us anything.,733
187353,m570,three kings,L609588,u8408,EPPS,Low on gas.  Got to refill.,733
187354,m570,three kings,L609587,u8410,WES,What are you doing.,733
187355,m570,three kings,L609569,u8408,EPPS,They shouldn't have been out this way that's all I'm saying.,733
187356,m570,three kings,L609568,u8410,WES,Deserters would have run they wouldn't have engaged.,733
187357,m570,three kings,L609567,u8408,EPPS,This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.,733
187358,m570,three kings,L609566,u8410,WES,We shouldn't have been here Epps.  There is a war going on!,733
187359,m570,three kings,L609565,u8408,EPPS,They shouldn't have been here.,733
187360,m570,three kings,L609541,u8410,WES,Oh Jesus they've stopped.,733
187361,m570,three kings,L609540,u8408,EPPS,Wha...,733
187362,m570,three kings,L609539,u8410,WES,They stopped.,733
187363,m570,three kings,L609528,u8408,EPPS,We're going to keep driving.,733
187364,m570,three kings,L609527,u8410,WES,What are we going to do!?,733
187365,m570,three kings,L609488,u8410,WES,No please not again.,733
187366,m570,three kings,L609487,u8408,EPPS,Why yes Jaeger.  I believe it is.,733
187367,m570,three kings,L609484,u8410,WES,I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.,733
187368,m570,three kings,L609483,u8408,EPPS,I know you think this is crazy but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.,733
187369,m570,three kings,L609482,u8410,WES,What?,733
187370,m570,three kings,L609479,u8410,WES,Oh God.,733
187371,m570,three kings,L609478,u8408,EPPS,Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.,733
187372,m570,three kings,L609457,u8408,EPPS,I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there what the hell that's what I say.,733
187373,m570,three kings,L609456,u8410,WES,You're out of your minds you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?,733
187374,m570,three kings,L609433,u8408,EPPS,Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.,733
187375,m570,three kings,L609432,u8410,WES,Damn this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.,733
187376,m570,three kings,L609431,u8408,EPPS,A casual one.,733
187377,m570,three kings,L609399,u8408,EPPS,There you go Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure and you're a millionaire.,733
187378,m570,three kings,L609398,u8410,WES,It's a map I think that's what it is.,733
187379,m570,three kings,L609395,u8408,EPPS,Help I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.,733
187380,m570,three kings,L609394,u8410,WES,What's it say?,733
187381,m570,three kings,L609393,u8408,EPPS,It's a fortune box.,733
187382,m570,three kings,L609392,u8410,WES,Paper.,733
187383,m570,three kings,L609334,u8408,EPPS,Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.,733
187384,m570,three kings,L609333,u8410,WES,Well based on my knowledge of the region its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.,733
187385,m570,three kings,L609317,u8410,WES,I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.,733
187386,m570,three kings,L609316,u8408,EPPS,Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.,733
187387,m570,three kings,L609308,u8408,EPPS,You know so much about the Middle East you know where we can get something to eat.,733
187388,m570,three kings,L609307,u8410,WES,...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.,733
187389,m570,three kings,L609300,u8408,EPPS,Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.,733
187390,m570,three kings,L609299,u8410,WES,Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?,733
187391,m570,three kings,L610246,u8408,EPPS,He's going to slow down.,733
187392,m570,three kings,L610245,u8409,JAEGER,He's not slowing.,733
187393,m570,three kings,L610244,u8408,EPPS,He'll slow down.,733
187394,m570,three kings,L610243,u8409,JAEGER,Epps I don't think he's slowing down.,733
187395,m570,three kings,L610241,u8408,EPPS,We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.,733
187396,m570,three kings,L610240,u8409,JAEGER,Well this is it.  We get the car find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.,733
187397,m570,three kings,L610239,u8408,EPPS,That's what I hear.  Don't matter.  Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.,733
187398,m570,three kings,L610238,u8409,JAEGER,Really?,733
187399,m570,three kings,L610237,u8408,EPPS,I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.,733
187400,m570,three kings,L610236,u8409,JAEGER,What?,733
187401,m570,three kings,L610235,u8408,EPPS,Australia.,733
187402,m570,three kings,L610234,u8408,EPPS,How the hell should I know?,733
187403,m570,three kings,L610233,u8409,JAEGER,I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?,733
187404,m570,three kings,L610232,u8408,EPPS,I don't know.,733
187405,m570,three kings,L610231,u8409,JAEGER,Still am.  There's more gold than I thought and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?,733
187406,m570,three kings,L610230,u8408,EPPS,Thought you were going to buy a car.,733
187407,m570,three kings,L610229,u8409,JAEGER,I'm thinking about taking a trip.,733
187408,m570,three kings,L610228,u8408,EPPS,What?,733
187409,m570,three kings,L610227,u8409,JAEGER,Epps?,733
187410,m570,three kings,L610226,u8408,EPPS,Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.,733
187411,m570,three kings,L610225,u8409,JAEGER,Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.,733
187412,m570,three kings,L610224,u8408,EPPS,Threatened to blow my brains out?,733
187413,m570,three kings,L610223,u8409,JAEGER,This whole time you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean even after I...you know...,733
187414,m570,three kings,L610222,u8408,EPPS,Thanks.,733
187415,m570,three kings,L610221,u8409,JAEGER,I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.,733
187416,m570,three kings,L610220,u8408,EPPS,Yeah.,733
187417,m570,three kings,L610219,u8409,JAEGER,Epps.,733
187418,m570,three kings,L610218,u8408,EPPS,Then I'm a rich man.,733
187419,m570,three kings,L610217,u8409,JAEGER,Yeah but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?,733
187420,m570,three kings,L610216,u8408,EPPS,Somebody has to.,733
187421,m570,three kings,L610215,u8409,JAEGER,Why do I have to lie in the road?,733
187422,m570,three kings,L610214,u8408,EPPS,You lie in the middle of the road look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.,733
187423,m570,three kings,L610213,u8409,JAEGER,How do we do that?,733
187424,m570,three kings,L610212,u8408,EPPS,A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does we jack it.,733
187425,m570,three kings,L610211,u8409,JAEGER,Well?,733
187426,m570,three kings,L610210,u8408,EPPS,You shouldn't think about things like that.  It'll just make you crazy.,733
187427,m570,three kings,L610209,u8409,JAEGER,What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean accidently what if I had...,733
187428,m570,three kings,L610208,u8408,EPPS,We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal no one had anything to worry about.,733
187429,m570,three kings,L610207,u8409,JAEGER,But...,733
187430,m570,three kings,L610206,u8408,EPPS,It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.,733
187431,m570,three kings,L610205,u8409,JAEGER,When did you make the switch?,733
187432,m570,three kings,L610204,u8408,EPPS,It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.,733
187433,m570,three kings,L610203,u8409,JAEGER,The...the gold...,733
187434,m570,three kings,L610202,u8408,EPPS,Damn it.  We lost the horses.,733
187435,m570,three kings,L610194,u8408,EPPS,We go this way.,733
187436,m570,three kings,L610193,u8409,JAEGER,Which way do we go!?,733
187437,m570,three kings,L610179,u8408,EPPS,No but I figure now's a real good time to start.,733
187438,m570,three kings,L610178,u8409,JAEGER,Can you ride a horse?,733
187439,m570,three kings,L610166,u8408,EPPS,Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.,733
187440,m570,three kings,L610165,u8409,JAEGER,I didn't say that.  I never said--,733
187441,m570,three kings,L610150,u8409,JAEGER,You were shot.  We were standing right there you were shot!,733
187442,m570,three kings,L610149,u8408,EPPS,...Wes...?,733
187443,m570,three kings,L610147,u8409,JAEGER,Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.,733
187444,m570,three kings,L610146,u8408,EPPS,You come up with a better plan let me know.,733
187445,m570,three kings,L610145,u8409,JAEGER,We can't just sit here waiting to die.,733
187446,m570,three kings,L610144,u8408,EPPS,With what?  Against how many?,733
187447,m570,three kings,L610143,u8409,JAEGER,...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.,733
187448,m570,three kings,L610142,u8408,EPPS,I don't know!,733
187449,m570,three kings,L610141,u8409,JAEGER,Why haven't they killed us!?,733
187450,m570,three kings,L610140,u8408,EPPS,I don't know.  They killed Wes.,733
187451,m570,three kings,L610139,u8409,JAEGER,Is that good or bad?,733
187452,m570,three kings,L610138,u8408,EPPS,Shi'ites I think.,733
187453,m570,three kings,L610137,u8409,JAEGER,What do you make of them?,733
187454,m570,three kings,L610134,u8408,EPPS,We keep going that's what we do.  We ignore them maybe they ignore us.,733
187455,m570,three kings,L610133,u8409,JAEGER,What do we do?,733
187456,m570,three kings,L610130,u8408,EPPS,Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.,733
187457,m570,three kings,L610129,u8409,JAEGER,To where?,733
187458,m570,three kings,L610128,u8408,EPPS,We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry and we'll head out on foot.,733
187459,m570,three kings,L610127,u8409,JAEGER,What do we do?,733
187460,m570,three kings,L610124,u8409,JAEGER,I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes like the guys who killed Wes.,733
187461,m570,three kings,L610123,u8408,EPPS,An Iraqi?,733
187462,m570,three kings,L610119,u8408,EPPS,Shoot them!,733
187463,m570,three kings,L610118,u8409,JAEGER,I just said I would.  I don't think I--,733
187464,m570,three kings,L610117,u8408,EPPS,Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!,733
187465,m570,three kings,L610116,u8408,EPPS,I don't have a weapon.,733
187466,m570,three kings,L610115,u8409,JAEGER,Can't you--,733
187467,m570,three kings,L610114,u8408,EPPS,Well you're going to start with a bang 'cause you've got four of them to take down.,733
187468,m570,three kings,L610113,u8409,JAEGER,I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.,733
187469,m570,three kings,L610112,u8408,EPPS,And then shoot them.,733
187470,m570,three kings,L610111,u8409,JAEGER,And then what?,733
187471,m570,three kings,L610110,u8408,EPPS,Slip out your M-16.,733
187472,m570,three kings,L610109,u8409,JAEGER,What are we going to do?,733
187473,m570,three kings,L610108,u8408,EPPS,They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.,733
187474,m570,three kings,L610107,u8409,JAEGER,Oh God...,733
187475,m570,three kings,L610105,u8408,EPPS,They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet Jesus.  Come on. Come on!,733
187476,m570,three kings,L610103,u8408,EPPS,What did you say?,733
187477,m570,three kings,L610100,u8409,JAEGER,Probably.,733
187478,m570,three kings,L610099,u8408,EPPS,That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.,733
187479,m570,three kings,L610098,u8409,JAEGER,Hell they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.,733
187480,m570,three kings,L610097,u8408,EPPS,Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.,733
187481,m570,three kings,L610096,u8409,JAEGER,Yeah I guess we should.,733
187482,m570,three kings,L610095,u8408,EPPS,Well we should identify ourselves.,733
187483,m570,three kings,L610094,u8409,JAEGER,Well?,733
187484,m570,three kings,L610091,u8409,JAEGER,Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.,733
187485,m570,three kings,L610090,u8408,EPPS,We can head back for our lines and they don't even have to know about the gold.,733
187486,m570,three kings,L610087,u8408,EPPS,Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.,733
187487,m570,three kings,L610086,u8409,JAEGER,Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?,733
187488,m570,three kings,L610085,u8408,EPPS,Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.,733
187489,m570,three kings,L610084,u8409,JAEGER,What do you figure it is?,733
187490,m570,three kings,L610081,u8409,JAEGER,Yeah but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.,733
187491,m570,three kings,L610080,u8408,EPPS,The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.,733
187492,m570,three kings,L610079,u8409,JAEGER,I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.,733
187493,m570,three kings,L610078,u8408,EPPS,Don't you touch it.,733
187494,m570,three kings,L610077,u8409,JAEGER,You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.,733
187495,m570,three kings,L610076,u8408,EPPS,We've got to keep moving while there's still light.,733
187496,m570,three kings,L610075,u8409,JAEGER,Just let me rest for a second.,733
187497,m570,three kings,L610074,u8408,EPPS,No!,733
187498,m570,three kings,L610073,u8409,JAEGER,Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.,733
187499,m570,three kings,L610072,u8408,EPPS,It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.,733
187500,m570,three kings,L610071,u8409,JAEGER,Getting cold.,733
187501,m570,three kings,L610070,u8408,EPPS,Okay.  Then we go this way.,733
187502,m570,three kings,L610069,u8409,JAEGER,I pick that way.,733
187503,m570,three kings,L610068,u8409,JAEGER,You sure you want me too?,733
187504,m570,three kings,L610067,u8408,EPPS,We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving so pick.,733
187505,m570,three kings,L610065,u8408,EPPS,It's got to be going better than this..,733
187506,m570,three kings,L610064,u8409,JAEGER,Wonder how the war's going?,733
187507,m570,three kings,L610063,u8408,EPPS,If we can find the Hummer or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.,733
187508,m570,three kings,L610062,u8409,JAEGER,What do you think our chances are?,733
187509,m570,three kings,L610061,u8408,EPPS,Damn.,733
187510,m570,three kings,L610060,u8409,JAEGER,Sorry.,733
187511,m570,three kings,L610058,u8409,JAEGER,I never had anything before Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to--,733
187512,m570,three kings,L610057,u8408,EPPS,It's all right.  I don't like it but it's over now.,733
187513,m570,three kings,L610056,u8409,JAEGER,I know what I did just now was crazy but you got to understand how much I want that gold.,733
187514,m570,three kings,L610055,u8408,EPPS,Makes two of us.,733
187515,m570,three kings,L610054,u8409,JAEGER,I don't want to die.,733
187516,m570,three kings,L610053,u8408,EPPS,Yeah.,733
187517,m570,three kings,L610052,u8409,JAEGER,Epps?,733
187518,m570,three kings,L610051,u8409,JAEGER,What?  Yeah.,733
187519,m570,three kings,L610050,u8408,EPPS,You still got a map on you?,733
187520,m570,three kings,L610049,u8409,JAEGER,Really I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.,733
187521,m570,three kings,L610048,u8408,EPPS,Sure.,733
187522,m570,three kings,L610047,u8409,JAEGER,I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game but I'm not like that.,733
187523,m570,three kings,L610046,u8408,EPPS,Yeah.  Well me too.,733
187524,m570,three kings,L610045,u8409,JAEGER,I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.,733
187525,m570,three kings,L610043,u8408,EPPS,Is it all right if I stand up?,733
187526,m570,three kings,L610042,u8409,JAEGER,I'm sorry about that Epps.,733
187527,m570,three kings,L610039,u8408,EPPS,That helicopter passes and the only thing we're close to is death.,733
187528,m570,three kings,L610038,u8409,JAEGER,I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.,733
187529,m570,three kings,L610037,u8408,EPPS,And you; you've got it all together.,733
187530,m570,three kings,L610036,u8409,JAEGER,I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.,733
187531,m570,three kings,L610035,u8408,EPPS,First Wes now you?,733
187532,m570,three kings,L610031,u8409,JAEGER,They'll search the pack.,733
187533,m570,three kings,L610030,u8408,EPPS,We'll lie.,733
187534,m570,three kings,L610029,u8409,JAEGER,They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.,733
187535,m570,three kings,L610028,u8408,EPPS,What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.,733
187536,m570,three kings,L610027,u8409,JAEGER,No.,733
187537,m570,three kings,L610026,u8408,EPPS,We need something:  A flare a signal mirror.,733
187538,m570,three kings,L610025,u8409,JAEGER,No.,733
187539,m570,three kings,L610019,u8409,JAEGER,Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead Epps and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.,733
187540,m570,three kings,L610018,u8408,EPPS,What if he's not?,733
187541,m570,three kings,L610017,u8409,JAEGER,Wes is dead!,733
187542,m570,three kings,L610016,u8408,EPPS,We can't just leave him.,733
187543,m570,three kings,L610015,u8409,JAEGER,Forget Wes.,733
187544,m570,three kings,L610014,u8408,EPPS,We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.,733
187545,m570,three kings,L610000,u8408,EPPS,We'll find our way!  We'll...,733
187546,m570,three kings,L609999,u8409,JAEGER,How!?,733
187547,m570,three kings,L609998,u8408,EPPS,We'll find our way.,733
187548,m570,three kings,L609997,u8409,JAEGER,What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?,733
187549,m570,three kings,L609973,u8408,EPPS,You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast.,733
187550,m570,three kings,L609972,u8409,JAEGER,It should or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.,733
187551,m570,three kings,L609971,u8408,EPPS,There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up and it should get us back down.,733
187552,m570,three kings,L609970,u8409,JAEGER,Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.,733
187553,m570,three kings,L609969,u8408,EPPS,We should head Northeast.,733
187554,m570,three kings,L609900,u8408,EPPS,It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.,733
187555,m570,three kings,L609899,u8409,JAEGER,Wes might be right about that.,733
187556,m570,three kings,L609891,u8408,EPPS,Not when you're up here with the gold I guess not.,733
187557,m570,three kings,L609890,u8409,JAEGER,Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.,733
187558,m570,three kings,L609889,u8408,EPPS,What the hell took so long.,733
187559,m570,three kings,L609882,u8409,JAEGER,Yeah.  Yeah that'll work.,733
187560,m570,three kings,L609881,u8408,EPPS,All right.  You go up I'll send up the gold then follow.,733
187561,m570,three kings,L609878,u8408,EPPS,Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.,733
187562,m570,three kings,L609877,u8409,JAEGER,I don't see how that plan's any better.,733
187563,m570,three kings,L609876,u8408,EPPS,Jesus Jaeger.,733
187564,m570,three kings,L609875,u8409,JAEGER,Why do I have to stay down here?,733
187565,m570,three kings,L609872,u8409,JAEGER,What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...,733
187566,m570,three kings,L609871,u8408,EPPS,He's not going to leave us.,733
187567,m570,three kings,L609870,u8409,JAEGER,We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?,733
187568,m570,three kings,L609869,u8408,EPPS,What?,733
187569,m570,three kings,L609868,u8408,EPPS,What?,733
187570,m570,three kings,L609867,u8409,JAEGER,Wait.,733
187571,m570,three kings,L609862,u8409,JAEGER,You don't have to imagine it.  Not anymore.  Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you.,733
187572,m570,three kings,L609861,u8408,EPPS,I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.,733
187573,m570,three kings,L609860,u8409,JAEGER,It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.,733
187574,m570,three kings,L609853,u8408,EPPS,Yeah Bwana you got it.,733
187575,m570,three kings,L609852,u8409,JAEGER,Is it dead?,733
187576,m570,three kings,L609851,u8408,EPPS,It's just a mongoose.,733
187577,m570,three kings,L609848,u8408,EPPS,It's giving.,733
187578,m570,three kings,L609847,u8409,JAEGER,Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.,733
187579,m570,three kings,L609845,u8408,EPPS,I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.,733
187580,m570,three kings,L609844,u8409,JAEGER,Must be a compartment.,733
187581,m570,three kings,L609840,u8408,EPPS,Get up off your ass and dig!,733
187582,m570,three kings,L609839,u8409,JAEGER,We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.,733
187583,m570,three kings,L609838,u8408,EPPS,Get up and dig.,733
187584,m570,three kings,L609837,u8409,JAEGER,I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything because there's nothing down here.,733
187585,m570,three kings,L609836,u8408,EPPS,It looks like you're not doing anything.,733
187586,m570,three kings,L609835,u8409,JAEGER,What does it look like I'm doing?,733
187587,m570,three kings,L609834,u8408,EPPS,What are you doing?,733
187588,m570,three kings,L609828,u8409,JAEGER,So where do we start?,733
187589,m570,three kings,L609827,u8408,EPPS,A whole lot of nothing.,733
187590,m570,three kings,L609822,u8408,EPPS,Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.,733
187591,m570,three kings,L609821,u8409,JAEGER,Think there might be more Iraqis?,733
187592,m570,three kings,L609802,u8408,EPPS,If they land we can take them.  If they don't land then we've got nothing to worry about.,733
187593,m570,three kings,L609801,u8409,JAEGER,If they land--,733
187594,m570,three kings,L609798,u8408,EPPS,They can't shoot us in here.,733
187595,m570,three kings,L609797,u8409,JAEGER,They're going to kill us!,733
187596,m570,three kings,L609796,u8408,EPPS,We're not going to do anything.,733
187597,m570,three kings,L609795,u8409,JAEGER,What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?,733
187598,m570,three kings,L609794,u8408,EPPS,Just stay down.,733
187599,m570,three kings,L609793,u8409,JAEGER,Where the hell is it!?,733
187600,m570,three kings,L609792,u8408,EPPS,Stay low.,733
187601,m570,three kings,L609791,u8409,JAEGER,Where is it?  Where'd it go?,733
187602,m570,three kings,L609777,u8408,EPPS,I hope it means something otherwise...,733
187603,m570,three kings,L609776,u8409,JAEGER,But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.,733
187604,m570,three kings,L609775,u8408,EPPS,Something like that.,733
187605,m570,three kings,L609774,u8409,JAEGER,X marks the spot.,733
187606,m570,three kings,L609751,u8409,JAEGER,So good bye Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.,733
187607,m570,three kings,L609750,u8408,EPPS,Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.,733
187608,m570,three kings,L609738,u8409,JAEGER,The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.,733
187609,m570,three kings,L609737,u8408,EPPS,They're doing more than slapping.,733
187610,m570,three kings,L609733,u8409,JAEGER,What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?,733
187611,m570,three kings,L609732,u8408,EPPS,Well it's Iraq.  I'm not sure but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.,733
187612,m570,three kings,L609731,u8409,JAEGER,What are they doing here?,733
187613,m570,three kings,L609730,u8408,EPPS,Iraqis.  A bunch of them.,733
187614,m570,three kings,L609727,u8408,EPPS,Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.,733
187615,m570,three kings,L609726,u8409,JAEGER,It's a fire fight.,733
187616,m570,three kings,L609725,u8408,EPPS,Don't!,733
187617,m570,three kings,L609723,u8408,EPPS,Shut up and listen!,733
187618,m570,three kings,L609722,u8409,JAEGER,I don't hear any--,733
187619,m570,three kings,L609718,u8409,JAEGER,Yeah I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.,733
187620,m570,three kings,L609717,u8408,EPPS,I didn't have to stop anything 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together understand?,733
187621,m570,three kings,L609714,u8409,JAEGER,Just figure it's my map I ought to hang on to it.,733
187622,m570,three kings,L609713,u8408,EPPS,You're not losing trust are you?,733
187623,m570,three kings,L609709,u8409,JAEGER,It's the treasure that's what it is.,733
187624,m570,three kings,L609708,u8408,EPPS,This.  Whatever it is.,733
187625,m570,three kings,L609705,u8408,EPPS,If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.,733
187626,m570,three kings,L609704,u8409,JAEGER,You don't know that.  It could be a trick.,733
187627,m570,three kings,L609703,u8408,EPPS,Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.,733
187628,m570,three kings,L609702,u8409,JAEGER,You're going to blow yourselves up.,733
187629,m570,three kings,L609687,u8409,JAEGER,Don't let me die Epps.  I don't want to die.,733
187630,m570,three kings,L609686,u8408,EPPS,When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.,733
187631,m570,three kings,L609685,u8409,JAEGER,You're not going to let me die are you!? Don't let me die!,733
187632,m570,three kings,L609684,u8408,EPPS,You're going to be fine.,733
187633,m570,three kings,L609683,u8409,JAEGER,That's going to do it right?  I'm going to be okay.,733
187634,m570,three kings,L609682,u8408,EPPS,Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope run our asses of and yank you off the mine.,733
187635,m570,three kings,L609681,u8409,JAEGER,How's this going to work?,733
187636,m570,three kings,L609680,u8408,EPPS,It falls asleep and you die so wake it the hell up.,733
187637,m570,three kings,L609679,u8409,JAEGER,I'm the one who can feel my leg and it's falling asleep.,733
187638,m570,three kings,L609678,u8408,EPPS,It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.,733
187639,m570,three kings,L609677,u8409,JAEGER,My leg is falling asleep.,733
187640,m570,three kings,L609673,u8409,JAEGER,Epps my leg is falling asleep.,733
187641,m570,three kings,L609672,u8408,EPPS,I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.,733
187642,m570,three kings,L609670,u8409,JAEGER,Epps...,733
187643,m570,three kings,L609669,u8408,EPPS,There's a way.,733
187644,m570,three kings,L609662,u8408,EPPS,I said be cool all right?  Now be cool!,733
187645,m570,three kings,L609661,u8409,JAEGER,You're moving away because it's going to blow up isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!,733
187646,m570,three kings,L609660,u8408,EPPS,We're going to be right over here.,733
187647,m570,three kings,L609659,u8409,JAEGER,Why you got to move away to talk!?,733
187648,m570,three kings,L609658,u8408,EPPS,Me and Wes are just going to talk.,733
187649,m570,three kings,L609657,u8409,JAEGER,Where you going?,733
187650,m570,three kings,L609656,u8408,EPPS,We're going to get off all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.,733
187651,m570,three kings,L609655,u8409,JAEGER,How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?,733
187652,m570,three kings,L609654,u8408,EPPS,Just relax.,733
187653,m570,three kings,L609653,u8409,JAEGER,It's a mine isn't it?,733
187654,m570,three kings,L609652,u8408,EPPS,Just be cool.,733
187655,m570,three kings,L609651,u8409,JAEGER,Oh God!  Oh God!,733
187656,m570,three kings,L609647,u8409,JAEGER,I heard it.,733
187657,m570,three kings,L609646,u8408,EPPS,If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.,733
187658,m570,three kings,L609645,u8409,JAEGER,I heard it click.,733
187659,m570,three kings,L609644,u8408,EPPS,You didn't step on any mine.,733
187660,m570,three kings,L609642,u8409,JAEGER,Mine.  Land mine!,733
187661,m570,three kings,L609641,u8408,EPPS,What?,733

187663,m570,three kings,L609639,u8408,EPPS,What!?,733
187664,m570,three kings,L609622,u8409,JAEGER,I'm just going to have a little sip that's all.  Just a sip.,733
187665,m570,three kings,L609621,u8408,EPPS,Don't drink up all of yours 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.,733
187666,m570,three kings,L609620,u8409,JAEGER,I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.,733
187667,m570,three kings,L609619,u8409,JAEGER,Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.,733
187668,m570,three kings,L609618,u8408,EPPS,Faster we get there faster we get back.,733
187669,m570,three kings,L609617,u8409,JAEGER,Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.,733
187670,m570,three kings,L609616,u8409,JAEGER,I got that...sir.,733
187671,m570,three kings,L609615,u8408,EPPS,SAY IT!,733
187672,m570,three kings,L609604,u8409,JAEGER,We leave it.,733
187673,m570,three kings,L609603,u8408,EPPS,What do we do with the Humvee?,733
187674,m570,three kings,L609593,u8409,JAEGER,I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.,733
187675,m570,three kings,L609592,u8408,EPPS,And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?,733
187676,m570,three kings,L609591,u8409,JAEGER,...I know.,733
187677,m570,three kings,L609590,u8408,EPPS,Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.,733

187679,m570,three kings,L609581,u8408,EPPS,It'd make their heads explode.,733
187680,m570,three kings,L609580,u8409,JAEGER,I know.  I know.  But I'm saying if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires man.  Millionaires!,733
187681,m570,three kings,L609579,u8408,EPPS,You can't tell anybody about this.,733
187682,m570,three kings,L609578,u8409,JAEGER,I'm just thinking you know if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.,733
187683,m570,three kings,L609577,u8408,EPPS,What?,733
187684,m570,three kings,L609576,u8408,EPPS,Let's go.,733
187685,m570,three kings,L609575,u8409,JAEGER,Yeah.  Yeah she's fine.,733

187690,m570,three kings,L609537,u8408,EPPS,Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.,733
187691,m570,three kings,L609532,u8408,EPPS,It's the only way.  We drive!,733
187692,m570,three kings,L609531,u8409,JAEGER,They're not going to--,733
187693,m570,three kings,L609530,u8408,EPPS,We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.,733
187694,m570,three kings,L609529,u8409,JAEGER,They'll shoot us!,733
187695,m570,three kings,L609525,u8408,EPPS,We can see them they can see us.  We run they chase.,733
187696,m570,three kings,L609524,u8409,JAEGER,We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.,733

187701,m570,three kings,L609513,u8408,EPPS,You know you sound just like a boy who's never--,733
187702,m570,three kings,L609512,u8409,JAEGER,And I'm talking about enjoying myself.,733
187703,m570,three kings,L609511,u8408,EPPS,It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money you take care of it let it grow and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.,733
187704,m570,three kings,L609510,u8409,JAEGER,Oh that's fun.,733

187707,m570,three kings,L609507,u8408,EPPS,You're getting gold and you're going to blow it on wheels?,733
187708,m570,three kings,L609504,u8408,EPPS,A car?  You're going to buy a car?,733
187709,m570,three kings,L609503,u8409,JAEGER,Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.,733
187710,m570,three kings,L609502,u8408,EPPS,Third.  What you're going to do with your third.,733
187711,m570,three kings,L609499,u8409,JAEGER,You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?,733
187712,m570,three kings,L609498,u8408,EPPS,But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.,733

187714,m570,three kings,L609480,u8409,JAEGER,You're such a pussy you know that? How'd you get in the army?,733
187715,m570,three kings,L609473,u8409,JAEGER,Roger that.,733
187716,m570,three kings,L609472,u8408,EPPS,Now this is war.,733
187717,m570,three kings,L609470,u8409,JAEGER,We go we get rich we go home.  It's that easy.,733
187718,m570,three kings,L609469,u8408,EPPS,It's going to be cool Wes.  It's all all right.,733
187719,m570,three kings,L609462,u8408,EPPS,But we all got to be in for this.  We all go or we do nothing.,733
187720,m570,three kings,L609461,u8409,JAEGER,We disappear for awhile.  We disappear we came back; nobody knows nothing.,733
187721,m570,three kings,L609460,u8408,EPPS,It's war.  People get lost all the time in war cut off--,733
187722,m570,three kings,L609447,u8409,JAEGER,What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.,733
187723,m570,three kings,L609446,u8408,EPPS,And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.,733
187724,m570,three kings,L609443,u8409,JAEGER,Christ!  Wes tell him.  You know this stuff.,733
187725,m570,three kings,L609442,u8408,EPPS,Wellllll if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star or the Enquirer?,733
187726,m570,three kings,L609441,u8409,JAEGER,Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped they pillaged the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures drew maps and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this man.  I read about it.,733
187727,m570,three kings,L609440,u8408,EPPS,I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.,733
187728,m570,three kings,L609439,u8409,JAEGER,Wait.  Wait.,733
187729,m570,three kings,L609438,u8408,EPPS,Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.,733
187730,m570,three kings,L609426,u8409,JAEGER,I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.,733
187731,m570,three kings,L609425,u8408,EPPS,Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.,733
187732,m570,three kings,L609424,u8409,JAEGER,They finally start the ground war and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.,733
187733,m570,three kings,L609401,u8408,EPPS,Yeah that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.,733
187734,m570,three kings,L609400,u8409,JAEGER,You think?,733
187735,m570,three kings,L609386,u8409,JAEGER,I did it!  I got the box open.,733
187736,m570,three kings,L609385,u8408,EPPS,What!?  What!?,733
187737,m570,three kings,L609384,u8409,JAEGER,OH MY GOD!,733
187738,m570,three kings,L609383,u8408,EPPS,You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.,733
187739,m570,three kings,L609380,u8409,JAEGER,I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.,733
187740,m570,three kings,L609379,u8408,EPPS,Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?,733
187741,m570,three kings,L609378,u8409,JAEGER,This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?,733
187742,m570,three kings,L609343,u8409,JAEGER,There might be.,733
187743,m570,three kings,L609342,u8408,EPPS,Yeah the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.,733
187744,m570,three kings,L609341,u8409,JAEGER,There might be something in there.,733
187745,m570,three kings,L609340,u8408,EPPS,Oh man you're not going to fall for that.,733
187746,m570,three kings,L609327,u8409,JAEGER,Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.,733
187747,m570,three kings,L609326,u8408,EPPS,Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.,733
187748,m570,three kings,L609298,u8408,EPPS,Another month in this desert and I might just.,733
187749,m570,three kings,L609297,u8409,JAEGER,Blow me.,733
187750,m570,three kings,L609296,u8408,EPPS,You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.,733
187751,m570,three kings,L609294,u8408,EPPS,No you're not.,733
187752,m570,three kings,L609293,u8409,JAEGER,I told you I'm shooting Iraqis.,733
187753,m570,three kings,L609292,u8408,EPPS,Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?,733
187754,m570,three kings,L609291,u8409,JAEGER,Don't get pissed at me just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.,733
187755,m570,three kings,L609290,u8408,EPPS,Knock it off!,733
187756,m570,three kings,L609289,u8409,JAEGER,At-at-at-at-at.,733
187757,m570,three kings,L609282,u8409,JAEGER,What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at- at-at--,733
187758,m570,three kings,L609281,u8408,EPPS,What are you doing?,733
187759,m570,three kings,L609280,u8409,JAEGER,At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.,733
187760,m570,three kings,L609416,u8409,JAEGER,Saddam's got a boil on his ass?,733
187762,m570,three kings,L609414,u8409,JAEGER,Some good ones.,733
187763,m570,three kings,L609413,u8409,JAEGER,The photos.,733
187765,m570,three kings,L609411,u8409,JAEGER,Just...want to be ready when we do.,733
187767,m570,three kings,L609409,u8409,JAEGER,I could use some recon photos too.,733
187770,m570,three kings,L609404,u8409,JAEGER,I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.,733
187772,m570,three kings,L609402,u8409,JAEGER,Woods.,733
187773,m570,three kings,L610156,u8410,WES,You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.,733
187774,m570,three kings,L610155,u8409,JAEGER,We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus Wes I killed the Iraqis in there.,733
187775,m570,three kings,L610154,u8410,WES,When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp cleaned me up fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies two fellow Americans left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?,733
187776,m570,three kings,L609988,u8410,WES,Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.,733
187777,m570,three kings,L609987,u8409,JAEGER,Think the Iraqi's killed them all?,733
187778,m570,three kings,L609986,u8410,WES,The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.,733
187779,m570,three kings,L609985,u8409,JAEGER,You're going to burn up in those.,733
187780,m570,three kings,L609967,u8410,WES,You want to say some words?,733
187781,m570,three kings,L609966,u8409,JAEGER,Maybe we ought to...you know bury him. Say some words over him.,733
187782,m570,three kings,L609946,u8410,WES,He'd just slow us down and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.,733
187783,m570,three kings,L609945,u8409,JAEGER,So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.,733
187784,m570,three kings,L609936,u8410,WES,I'm not wasting my water on him.,733
187785,m570,three kings,L609935,u8409,JAEGER,I think he wants something to drink.,733
187786,m570,three kings,L609934,u8410,WES,All last night he could have been--,733
187787,m570,three kings,L609933,u8409,JAEGER,Maybe we should give him some water.,733
187788,m570,three kings,L609927,u8409,JAEGER,He lived through that?,733
187789,m570,three kings,L609926,u8410,WES,Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.,733
187790,m570,three kings,L609921,u8410,WES,He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.,733
187791,m570,three kings,L609920,u8409,JAEGER,With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.,733
187792,m570,three kings,L609855,u8409,JAEGER,I think we found something.,733
187793,m570,three kings,L609854,u8410,WES,What the hell are you doing!?,733
187794,m570,three kings,L609825,u8410,WES,What do you see?,733
187795,m570,three kings,L609824,u8409,JAEGER,Yeah we're down.,733
187796,m570,three kings,L609823,u8410,WES,You down?,733
187797,m570,three kings,L609817,u8409,JAEGER,Guess we know what the next stop is.,733
187798,m570,three kings,L609816,u8410,WES,It's got a bottom.,733
187799,m570,three kings,L609812,u8409,JAEGER,Lines up with the map and the photos.,733
187800,m570,three kings,L609811,u8410,WES,What do you think?,733
187801,m570,three kings,L609788,u8410,WES,Just seems weird they didn't chase us.,733
187802,m570,three kings,L609787,u8409,JAEGER,Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.,733
187803,m570,three kings,L609767,u8410,WES,We make it or we go back empty handed.,733
187804,m570,three kings,L609766,u8409,JAEGER,Think we can make it?,733
187805,m570,three kings,L609755,u8409,JAEGER,I've got a new agenda now it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.,733
187806,m570,three kings,L609754,u8410,WES,You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.,733
187807,m570,three kings,L609753,u8409,JAEGER,Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.,733
187808,m570,three kings,L609752,u8410,WES,We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.,733
187809,m570,three kings,L609744,u8410,WES,We have to do something.,733
187810,m570,three kings,L609743,u8409,JAEGER,So?,733
187811,m570,three kings,L609740,u8409,JAEGER,I know you're a pussy.  I know that.,733
187812,m570,three kings,L609739,u8410,WES,Is there anything you do know?,733
187813,m570,three kings,L609736,u8410,WES,Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.,733
187814,m570,three kings,L609735,u8409,JAEGER,Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?,733
187815,m570,three kings,L609720,u8409,JAEGER,Anytime you want to do something about it just let--,733
187816,m570,three kings,L609719,u8410,WES,I'm getting tired of you riding me Jaeger.,733
187817,m570,three kings,L609716,u8409,JAEGER,Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.,733
187818,m570,three kings,L609715,u8410,WES,If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.,733
187819,m570,three kings,L609701,u8410,WES,You want to crawl crawl.,733
187820,m570,three kings,L609700,u8409,JAEGER,That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.,733
187821,m570,three kings,L609699,u8410,WES,Haven't found a mine for half a mile or more.,733
187822,m570,three kings,L609698,u8409,JAEGER,Until we're out of the mine field is how long.,733
187823,m570,three kings,L609697,u8410,WES,How long we going to keep this up.,733
187824,m570,three kings,L609668,u8410,WES,Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.,733
187825,m570,three kings,L609667,u8409,JAEGER,Epps...,733
187826,m570,three kings,L609610,u8409,JAEGER,You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...,733
187827,m570,three kings,L609609,u8410,WES,Really?  What is that an order <u>private</u>?,733
187828,m570,three kings,L609608,u8409,JAEGER,You have to go with us Wes.,733
187829,m570,three kings,L609607,u8410,WES,You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick little treasure hunt then go ahead but mark me absent.,733
187830,m570,three kings,L609602,u8409,JAEGER,As soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway.  We're not that far.  We can make it.,733
187831,m570,three kings,L609601,u8410,WES,Then lets go back while we still can.,733
187832,m570,three kings,L609600,u8409,JAEGER,We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.,733
187833,m570,three kings,L609595,u8409,JAEGER,...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.,733
187834,m570,three kings,L609594,u8410,WES,So you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?,733
187835,m570,three kings,L609561,u8410,WES,We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed and you want to go on?,733
187836,m570,three kings,L609560,u8409,JAEGER,We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.,733
187837,m570,three kings,L609559,u8410,WES,We have to go back.,733
187838,m570,three kings,L609558,u8410,WES,We got to get out of here.,733
187839,m570,three kings,L609557,u8409,JAEGER,Yeah well we're not.,733
187840,m570,three kings,L609556,u8410,WES,I thought we were dead.,733
187841,m570,three kings,L609536,u8409,JAEGER,You see that?  Right by us.  They went right by.  You had them Epps; you called it.,733
187842,m570,three kings,L609535,u8410,WES,I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.,733
187843,m570,three kings,L609534,u8409,JAEGER,Yeah!  Yeah!,733

187846,m570,three kings,L609520,u8409,JAEGER,Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.,733
187847,m570,three kings,L609519,u8410,WES,Oh God!,733
187848,m570,three kings,L609518,u8409,JAEGER,Iraqis.,733
187849,m570,three kings,L609506,u8409,JAEGER,A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--,733
187850,m570,three kings,L609505,u8410,WES,This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.,733
187851,m570,three kings,L609501,u8409,JAEGER,You know what I'm doing with my half?,733
187852,m570,three kings,L609500,u8410,WES,If there's gold.  If!,733

187855,m570,three kings,L609495,u8410,WES,I don't know.  It would be small easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.,733
187856,m570,three kings,L609494,u8409,JAEGER,Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?,733
187857,m570,three kings,L609493,u8410,WES,If!  If there's a treasure.,733

187867,m570,three kings,L609463,u8410,WES,Epps you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand but you're smarter.,733
187868,m570,three kings,L609454,u8410,WES,So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy Epps.,733
187869,m570,three kings,L609453,u8409,JAEGER,It's real.  I'm telling you it's real.,733
187870,m570,three kings,L609452,u8410,WES,It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert mountains a river.  If the map is even real.,733

187883,m570,three kings,L609381,u8410,WES,The longer the air force hits the Iraqis the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.,733
187884,m570,three kings,L609376,u8409,JAEGER,At-at-at-at-at.,733
187885,m570,three kings,L609375,u8410,WES,This is so weird.  It's happening but it's not.  It's like a TV show and we're part of it.,733
187886,m570,three kings,L609374,u8409,JAEGER,At-at-at-at-at.,733
187887,m570,three kings,L609371,u8409,JAEGER,The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me soldier I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.,733
187888,m570,three kings,L609370,u8410,WES,You ever think about it?  You ever worry?,733
187889,m570,three kings,L609369,u8409,JAEGER,Come on man.  I almost had this thing open.,733
187890,m570,three kings,L609368,u8410,WES,You ever think about dying?,733
187891,m570,three kings,L609367,u8409,JAEGER,What!?,733
187892,m570,three kings,L609366,u8410,WES,Jaeger?,733
187893,m570,three kings,L609364,u8410,WES,Why would they do all that if we weren't?,733
187894,m570,three kings,L609363,u8409,JAEGER,It doesn't mean anything.,733
187895,m570,three kings,L609362,u8410,WES,We're going to war aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.,733
187896,m570,three kings,L609361,u8409,JAEGER,What's your point Wes?  You have a point?,733
187897,m570,three kings,L609360,u8410,WES,They're cancelling all leaves all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--,733
187898,m570,three kings,L609359,u8409,JAEGER,Like I said; so?,733
187899,m570,three kings,L609358,u8410,WES,That's in two days.,733
187900,m570,three kings,L609357,u8409,JAEGER,Yeah.  So?,733
187901,m570,three kings,L609356,u8410,WES,You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.,733
187902,m570,three kings,L609355,u8409,JAEGER,What?,733
187903,m570,three kings,L609354,u8410,WES,Jaeger?,733
187904,m570,three kings,L609353,u8409,JAEGER,I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.,733
187905,m570,three kings,L609352,u8410,WES,You really think there's a treasure inside?,733
187906,m570,three kings,L609351,u8409,JAEGER,I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.,733
187907,m570,three kings,L609350,u8410,WES,You will.  You'll get it.,733
187908,m570,three kings,L609349,u8409,JAEGER,Naw nothing.,733

187910,m570,three kings,L609345,u8409,JAEGER,I could.,733
187911,m570,three kings,L609344,u8410,WES,And you're the guy who's going to open it.,733
187912,m570,three kings,L609339,u8409,JAEGER,For real?  A treasure?,733
187913,m570,three kings,L609338,u8410,WES,It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.,733
187914,m570,three kings,L609337,u8409,JAEGER,Yeah you're funny.,733
187915,m570,three kings,L609336,u8410,WES,He says it's a box.,733
187916,m570,three kings,L609332,u8409,JAEGER,What is it?  You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.,733
187917,m570,three kings,L609331,u8410,WES,Now you need me.,733
187918,m570,three kings,L609330,u8409,JAEGER,What is this?,733
187919,m570,three kings,L609325,u8410,WES,Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.,733
187920,m570,three kings,L609323,u8410,WES,Don't shoot me I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.,733
187921,m570,three kings,L609322,u8409,JAEGER,What does that mean?,733
187922,m570,three kings,L609319,u8410,WES,I thought it would be good to know.,733
187923,m570,three kings,L609318,u8409,JAEGER,Spanish wasn't hard enough?,733
187924,m570,three kings,L609315,u8410,WES,I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.,733
187925,m570,three kings,L609314,u8409,JAEGER,It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.,733
187926,m570,three kings,L609313,u8410,WES,Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.,733
187927,m570,three kings,L609311,u8409,JAEGER,Oh yeah.  Accidently.,733

187932,m570,three kings,L609302,u8410,WES,I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.,733
187933,m570,three kings,L609301,u8409,JAEGER,We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.,733

187936,m570,three kings,L609286,u8409,JAEGER,I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.,733
187937,m570,three kings,L609285,u8410,WES,Yeah a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.,733
