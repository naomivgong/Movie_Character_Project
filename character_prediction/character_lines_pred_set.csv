8,m0,10 things i hate about you,L869,u0,BIANCA,Like my fear of wearing pastels?
9,m0,10 things i hate about you,L867,u0,BIANCA,What good stuff?
10,m0,10 things i hate about you,L866,u2,CAMERON,I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
11,m0,10 things i hate about you,L865,u2,CAMERON,Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
12,m0,10 things i hate about you,L864,u0,BIANCA,Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like boring myself.

15,m0,10 things i hate about you,L861,u2,CAMERON,No...
16,m0,10 things i hate about you,L699,u2,CAMERON,You always been this selfish?
17,m0,10 things i hate about you,L698,u0,BIANCA,But
18,m0,10 things i hate about you,L697,u2,CAMERON,Then that's all you had to say.
19,m0,10 things i hate about you,L696,u0,BIANCA,Well no...
20,m0,10 things i hate about you,L695,u2,CAMERON,You never wanted to go out with 'me did you?
21,m0,10 things i hate about you,L694,u0,BIANCA,I was?
22,m0,10 things i hate about you,L663,u0,BIANCA,Tons
23,m0,10 things i hate about you,L662,u2,CAMERON,Have fun tonight?

27,m0,10 things i hate about you,L575,u0,BIANCA,Hi.
28,m0,10 things i hate about you,L407,u0,BIANCA,Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
29,m0,10 things i hate about you,L406,u2,CAMERON,So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
30,m0,10 things i hate about you,L405,u0,BIANCA,Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
31,m0,10 things i hate about you,L404,u2,CAMERON,She's not a...
32,m0,10 things i hate about you,L403,u2,CAMERON,I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
33,m0,10 things i hate about you,L402,u0,BIANCA,I really really really wanna go but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
34,m0,10 things i hate about you,L401,u2,CAMERON,Sure have.
35,m0,10 things i hate about you,L368,u0,BIANCA,Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
36,m0,10 things i hate about you,L367,u2,CAMERON,How do you get your hair to look like that?
37,m0,10 things i hate about you,L366,u0,BIANCA,You're sweet.
38,m0,10 things i hate about you,L365,u2,CAMERON,You have my word.  As a gentleman
39,m0,10 things i hate about you,L364,u0,BIANCA,I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
40,m0,10 things i hate about you,L363,u2,CAMERON,You got something on your mind?
41,m0,10 things i hate about you,L281,u0,BIANCA,Where?
42,m0,10 things i hate about you,L280,u2,CAMERON,There.
43,m0,10 things i hate about you,L277,u2,CAMERON,Well there's someone I think might be --
44,m0,10 things i hate about you,L276,u0,BIANCA,How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
45,m0,10 things i hate about you,L275,u0,BIANCA,Forget French.
46,m0,10 things i hate about you,L274,u2,CAMERON,That's because it's such a nice one.
47,m0,10 things i hate about you,L273,u0,BIANCA,I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
48,m0,10 things i hate about you,L272,u2,CAMERON,Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
49,m0,10 things i hate about you,L271,u0,BIANCA,C'esc ma tete. This is my head
50,m0,10 things i hate about you,L208,u2,CAMERON,Let me see what I can do.
51,m0,10 things i hate about you,L207,u0,BIANCA,Gosh if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
52,m0,10 things i hate about you,L206,u2,CAMERON,That's a shame.
53,m0,10 things i hate about you,L205,u0,BIANCA,Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
54,m0,10 things i hate about you,L204,u2,CAMERON,Why?
55,m0,10 things i hate about you,L203,u2,CAMERON,Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
56,m0,10 things i hate about you,L202,u0,BIANCA,The thing is Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
57,m0,10 things i hate about you,L201,u2,CAMERON,Cameron.
58,m0,10 things i hate about you,L200,u0,BIANCA,No no it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
59,m0,10 things i hate about you,L199,u2,CAMERON,Forget it.
60,m0,10 things i hate about you,L198,u0,BIANCA,You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
61,m0,10 things i hate about you,L197,u2,CAMERON,Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
62,m0,10 things i hate about you,L196,u0,BIANCA,Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
63,m0,10 things i hate about you,L195,u2,CAMERON,Well I thought we'd start with pronunciation if that's okay with you.
64,m0,10 things i hate about you,L194,u0,BIANCA,Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
65,m0,10 things i hate about you,L953,u0,BIANCA,I did.
68,m0,10 things i hate about you,L659,u0,BIANCA,I have to be home in twenty minutes.
70,m0,10 things i hate about you,L599,u0,BIANCA,Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with you know?
72,m0,10 things i hate about you,L597,u0,BIANCA,Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
74,m0,10 things i hate about you,L595,u0,BIANCA,He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
75,m0,10 things i hate about you,L580,u0,BIANCA,Would you mind getting me a drink Cameron?
77,m0,10 things i hate about you,L573,u0,BIANCA,Joey.
79,m0,10 things i hate about you,L571,u0,BIANCA,Where did he go?  He was just here.
80,m0,10 things i hate about you,L51,u0,BIANCA,You might wanna think about it
82,m0,10 things i hate about you,L49,u0,BIANCA,Did you change your hair?
83,m0,10 things i hate about you,L760,u0,BIANCA,You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
86,m0,10 things i hate about you,L757,u0,BIANCA,Hi Joey.
89,m0,10 things i hate about you,L592,u0,BIANCA,Neat...
91,m0,10 things i hate about you,L590,u0,BIANCA,Queen Harry?
92,m0,10 things i hate about you,L397,u0,BIANCA,Hopefully.
94,m0,10 things i hate about you,L395,u0,BIANCA,Expensive?
96,m0,10 things i hate about you,L1052,u5,KAT,Perm?
97,m0,10 things i hate about you,L1051,u0,BIANCA,Patrick -- is that- a.
98,m0,10 things i hate about you,L1022,u5,KAT,It's just you.
99,m0,10 things i hate about you,L1021,u0,BIANCA,Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
100,m0,10 things i hate about you,L1011,u0,BIANCA,No! I just wanted
101,m0,10 things i hate about you,L1010,u5,KAT,What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
102,m0,10 things i hate about you,L1009,u0,BIANCA,I just wanted --
103,m0,10 things i hate about you,L1008,u5,KAT,You set me up.
104,m0,10 things i hate about you,L1007,u0,BIANCA,Let go!
105,m0,10 things i hate about you,L983,u5,KAT,So did you
106,m0,10 things i hate about you,L982,u0,BIANCA,You looked beautiful last night you know.
107,m0,10 things i hate about you,L914,u0,BIANCA,I guess I'll never know will I?
108,m0,10 things i hate about you,L913,u5,KAT,Not all experiences are good Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
109,m0,10 things i hate about you,L912,u0,BIANCA,God you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark so I can't experience anything for myself
110,m0,10 things i hate about you,L911,u5,KAT,I guess I thought I was protecting you.
111,m0,10 things i hate about you,L910,u0,BIANCA,I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
112,m0,10 things i hate about you,L909,u5,KAT,That's not
113,m0,10 things i hate about you,L908,u0,BIANCA,No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
114,m0,10 things i hate about you,L907,u5,KAT,I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
115,m0,10 things i hate about you,L906,u0,BIANCA,Why didn't you tell me?
116,m0,10 things i hate about you,L904,u0,BIANCA,But
117,m0,10 things i hate about you,L903,u5,KAT,Just once.  Afterwards I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
118,m0,10 things i hate about you,L902,u0,BIANCA,You did what?
119,m0,10 things i hate about you,L901,u5,KAT,He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
120,m0,10 things i hate about you,L900,u0,BIANCA,As in...
121,m0,10 things i hate about you,L899,u5,KAT,Now I do.  Back then was a different story.
122,m0,10 things i hate about you,L898,u0,BIANCA,But you hate Joey
123,m0,10 things i hate about you,L897,u5,KAT,He was like a total babe
124,m0,10 things i hate about you,L896,u0,BIANCA,Why?
125,m0,10 things i hate about you,L895,u5,KAT,In 9th.  For a month
126,m0,10 things i hate about you,L894,u0,BIANCA,What?
127,m0,10 things i hate about you,L893,u5,KAT,Joey never told you we went out did he?
128,m0,10 things i hate about you,L892,u0,BIANCA,I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go because you won ' t.
129,m0,10 things i hate about you,L891,u5,KAT,I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons not someone else ' s .
130,m0,10 things i hate about you,L890,u0,BIANCA,Like you care.
131,m0,10 things i hate about you,L889,u5,KAT,Listen I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
132,m0,10 things i hate about you,L656,u5,KAT,You're welcome.
133,m0,10 things i hate about you,L655,u0,BIANCA,I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
134,m0,10 things i hate about you,L602,u0,BIANCA,I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
135,m0,10 things i hate about you,L601,u5,KAT,Bianca I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
136,m0,10 things i hate about you,L543,u5,KAT,Can we go now?
137,m0,10 things i hate about you,L542,u0,BIANCA,You are so completely unbalanced.
138,m0,10 things i hate about you,L533,u0,BIANCA,Yeah he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out I should obsess over a dead guy too.
139,m0,10 things i hate about you,L532,u5,KAT,It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
140,m0,10 things i hate about you,L531,u0,BIANCA,Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
141,m0,10 things i hate about you,L530,u5,KAT,At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
142,m0,10 things i hate about you,L529,u0,BIANCA,Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
143,m0,10 things i hate about you,L527,u0,BIANCA,Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
144,m0,10 things i hate about you,L526,u5,KAT,What's normal?
145,m0,10 things i hate about you,L525,u0,BIANCA,You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal I can't be normal.
146,m0,10 things i hate about you,L445,u0,BIANCA,I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
147,m0,10 things i hate about you,L444,u5,KAT,What do you think?
148,m0,10 things i hate about you,L443,u0,BIANCA,Oh I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
149,m0,10 things i hate about you,L442,u5,KAT,It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
150,m0,10 things i hate about you,L441,u0,BIANCA,Oh my God does this mean you're becoming normal?
151,m0,10 things i hate about you,L320,u0,BIANCA,Can you at least start wearing a bra?
152,m0,10 things i hate about you,L319,u5,KAT,I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
153,m0,10 things i hate about you,L165,u0,BIANCA,Nowhere... Hi Daddy.
154,m0,10 things i hate about you,L164,u5,KAT,Where've you been?
155,m0,10 things i hate about you,L923,u0,BIANCA,I have a date Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
157,m0,10 things i hate about you,L884,u0,BIANCA,Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
160,m0,10 things i hate about you,L880,u0,BIANCA,No but
162,m0,10 things i hate about you,L878,u0,BIANCA,Daddy I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
164,m0,10 things i hate about you,L545,u0,BIANCA,Why?
167,m0,10 things i hate about you,L539,u0,BIANCA,Daddy no!
169,m0,10 things i hate about you,L537,u0,BIANCA,It's just a party. Daddy.
172,m0,10 things i hate about you,L523,u0,BIANCA,Daddy people expect me to be there!
174,m0,10 things i hate about you,L519,u0,BIANCA,If you must know we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
176,m0,10 things i hate about you,L517,u0,BIANCA,Daddy I --
178,m0,10 things i hate about you,L189,u0,BIANCA,But she doesn't want to date.
179,m0,10 things i hate about you,L183,u0,BIANCA,But it's not fair -- she's a mutant Daddy!
181,m0,10 things i hate about you,L181,u0,BIANCA,What if she never starts dating?
183,m0,10 things i hate about you,L179,u0,BIANCA,Now don't get upset. Daddy but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
185,m0,10 things i hate about you,L462,u9,PATRICK,Padua girls.  One tall decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
187,m0,10 things i hate about you,L460,u9,PATRICK,Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
189,m0,10 things i hate about you,L458,u9,PATRICK,Always a pleasure Brucie.
190,m0,10 things i hate about you,L779,u7,MICHAEL,Best case scenario you're back on the payroll for awhile.
191,m0,10 things i hate about you,L778,u2,CAMERON,You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
192,m0,10 things i hate about you,L586,u2,CAMERON,No I ' m not.
193,m0,10 things i hate about you,L585,u7,MICHAEL,Buttholus extremus.  But hey you're making progress.
194,m0,10 things i hate about you,L584,u2,CAMERON,The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
195,m0,10 things i hate about you,L583,u7,MICHAEL,Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
196,m0,10 things i hate about you,L500,u2,CAMERON,Hell I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
197,m0,10 things i hate about you,L499,u7,MICHAEL,You told me that part already.

209,m0,10 things i hate about you,L388,u2,CAMERON,This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
210,m0,10 things i hate about you,L245,u7,MICHAEL,Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots and while he's busy setting up the plan you have time to woo Bianca.
211,m0,10 things i hate about you,L244,u2,CAMERON,You got him involved?
212,m0,10 things i hate about you,L225,u7,MICHAEL,Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.

214,m0,10 things i hate about you,L223,u7,MICHAEL,You know if you do go out with Bianca you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
215,m0,10 things i hate about you,L222,u2,CAMERON,That's what I just said
216,m0,10 things i hate about you,L221,u7,MICHAEL,Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
217,m0,10 things i hate about you,L220,u2,CAMERON,Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
218,m0,10 things i hate about you,L219,u7,MICHAEL,I'm serious man he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
219,m0,10 things i hate about you,L218,u2,CAMERON,They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
220,m0,10 things i hate about you,L217,u7,MICHAEL,No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
221,m0,10 things i hate about you,L216,u2,CAMERON,He seems like he thrives on danger
222,m0,10 things i hate about you,L215,u7,MICHAEL,What makes you think he'll do it?
223,m0,10 things i hate about you,L213,u7,MICHAEL,You wanna go out with him?
224,m0,10 things i hate about you,L212,u2,CAMERON,What about him?
225,m0,10 things i hate about you,L211,u7,MICHAEL,Unlikely but even so she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?

229,m0,10 things i hate about you,L157,u7,MICHAEL,Yeah just a minor encounter with the shrew.
230,m0,10 things i hate about you,L147,u7,MICHAEL,You could consecrate with her my friend.

493,m0,10 things i hate about you,L645,u9,PATRICK,I thought you were above all that
494,m0,10 things i hate about you,L643,u9,PATRICK,I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
495,m0,10 things i hate about you,L642,u5,KAT,I hate him.
496,m0,10 things i hate about you,L641,u9,PATRICK,Dorsey.
497,m0,10 things i hate about you,L640,u5,KAT,Who?

499,m0,10 things i hate about you,L636,u5,KAT,Just let me sit down.
500,m0,10 things i hate about you,L635,u9,PATRICK,See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
501,m0,10 things i hate about you,L634,u5,KAT,Like you could find one
502,m0,10 things i hate about you,L633,u9,PATRICK,Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
503,m0,10 things i hate about you,L632,u5,KAT,Why?
504,m0,10 things i hate about you,L631,u9,PATRICK,Sure I do
505,m0,10 things i hate about you,L630,u5,KAT,You don't care if I die
506,m0,10 things i hate about you,L629,u9,PATRICK,I told you
507,m0,10 things i hate about you,L628,u5,KAT,Why 're you doing this?
508,m0,10 things i hate about you,L627,u9,PATRICK,Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
509,m0,10 things i hate about you,L626,u5,KAT,This is so patronizing.
510,m0,10 things i hate about you,L616,u9,PATRICK,What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
511,m0,10 things i hate about you,L615,u5,KAT,I know just let me sleep
512,m0,10 things i hate about you,L614,u9,PATRICK,Uh uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
513,m0,10 things i hate about you,L613,u5,KAT,I just need to lie down for awhile
514,m0,10 things i hate about you,L612,u9,PATRICK,You're not okay.
515,m0,10 things i hate about you,L611,u5,KAT,I'm fine. I'm

520,m0,10 things i hate about you,L483,u9,PATRICK,Why don't you?
521,m0,10 things i hate about you,L482,u5,KAT,You know who The Raincoats are?
522,m0,10 things i hate about you,L481,u9,PATRICK,You know these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats but they're right up there.
523,m0,10 things i hate about you,L477,u9,PATRICK,Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
524,m0,10 things i hate about you,L476,u5,KAT,That's what you want isn't it?
525,m0,10 things i hate about you,L475,u9,PATRICK,Excuse me?
526,m0,10 things i hate about you,L473,u9,PATRICK,hey.  Great show huh?
527,m0,10 things i hate about you,L334,u5,KAT,Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
528,m0,10 things i hate about you,L333,u9,PATRICK,You're not a big talker are you?
529,m0,10 things i hate about you,L332,u5,KAT,Hi
530,m0,10 things i hate about you,L331,u9,PATRICK,I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
531,m0,10 things i hate about you,L330,u5,KAT,Are you following me?
532,m0,10 things i hate about you,L328,u9,PATRICK,Seven-thirty?
533,m0,10 things i hate about you,L327,u5,KAT,You -- covered in my vomit.

535,m0,10 things i hate about you,L325,u5,KAT,And why would I do that?
536,m0,10 things i hate about you,L324,u9,PATRICK,Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
537,m0,10 things i hate about you,L323,u5,KAT,I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
538,m0,10 things i hate about you,L322,u9,PATRICK,You hate me don't you?
539,m0,10 things i hate about you,L313,u9,PATRICK,I know a lot more than that
540,m0,10 things i hate about you,L312,u5,KAT,Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name screwboy?
541,m0,10 things i hate about you,L311,u9,PATRICK,The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.

545,m0,10 things i hate about you,L306,u9,PATRICK,There's a way to get a guy's attention.
546,m0,10 things i hate about you,L305,u5,KAT,Sweating like a pig actually.  And yourself?

549,m0,10 things i hate about you,L999,u5,KAT,When I go?
552,m0,10 things i hate about you,L996,u5,KAT,What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
554,m0,10 things i hate about you,L994,u5,KAT,The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
556,m0,10 things i hate about you,L992,u5,KAT,Parts of it.
558,m0,10 things i hate about you,L990,u5,KAT,No Daddy.
561,m0,10 things i hate about you,L987,u5,KAT,Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
563,m0,10 things i hate about you,L347,u5,KAT,I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
565,m0,10 things i hate about you,L345,u5,KAT,So what I want doesn't matter?
567,m0,10 things i hate about you,L343,u5,KAT,Because you're making decisions for me.
569,m0,10 things i hate about you,L341,u5,KAT,I thought you were punishing me.
571,m0,10 things i hate about you,L339,u5,KAT,Then tell them I had a seizure.
574,m0,10 things i hate about you,L184,u5,KAT,This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
575,m0,10 things i hate about you,L174,u5,KAT,You decided.
577,m0,10 things i hate about you,L172,u5,KAT,I know.
579,m0,10 things i hate about you,L1017,u5,KAT,Am I supposed to feel better? Like right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
580,m0,10 things i hate about you,L108,u5,KAT,Tempestuous?
582,m0,10 things i hate about you,L106,u5,KAT,I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
584,m0,10 things i hate about you,L104,u5,KAT,Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
587,m0,10 things i hate about you,L737,u7,MICHAEL,Kat a fan too?
589,m0,10 things i hate about you,L735,u7,MICHAEL,Macbeth right?

598,m0,10 things i hate about you,L775,u9,PATRICK,You were right. She's still pissed.
599,m0,10 things i hate about you,L724,u9,PATRICK,No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
600,m0,10 things i hate about you,L723,u7,MICHAEL,So you got cozy with she who stings?
601,m0,10 things i hate about you,L437,u9,PATRICK,I'm likin' you guys better
602,m0,10 things i hate about you,L436,u7,MICHAEL,I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
603,m0,10 things i hate about you,L429,u9,PATRICK,Yeah.
604,m0,10 things i hate about you,L428,u7,MICHAEL,Ever been to Club Skunk?
605,m0,10 things i hate about you,L421,u7,MICHAEL,Just for now.
606,m0,10 things i hate about you,L415,u7,MICHAEL,Good enough.

609,m0,10 things i hate about you,L383,u9,PATRICK,You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
610,m0,10 things i hate about you,L382,u7,MICHAEL,Patrick Pat you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
611,m0,10 things i hate about you,L381,u9,PATRICK,So Dorsey can get the girl?
612,m0,10 things i hate about you,L380,u7,MICHAEL,That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
613,m0,10 things i hate about you,L379,u9,PATRICK,Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
614,m0,10 things i hate about you,L378,u7,MICHAEL,I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
615,m0,10 things i hate about you,L377,u9,PATRICK,What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
616,m0,10 things i hate about you,L376,u7,MICHAEL,The situation is my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
617,m0,10 things i hate about you,L375,u9,PATRICK,What plan?
618,m0,10 things i hate about you,L373,u9,PATRICK,Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
619,m0,10 things i hate about you,L372,u7,MICHAEL,What?
620,m0,10 things i hate about you,L371,u9,PATRICK,Say it

623,m0,10 things i hate about you,L264,u9,PATRICK,Well you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
625,m0,10 things i hate about you,L262,u9,PATRICK,What's to discuss?
628,m0,10 things i hate about you,L258,u9,PATRICK,Touch of the flu.
631,m0,10 things i hate about you,L61,u9,PATRICK,It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
633,m0,10 things i hate about you,L59,u9,PATRICK,I missed you.
4110,m18,american madness,L34791,u288,DICKSON,Yeah - sure!
4112,m18,american madness,L34789,u288,DICKSON,If she can't pay I'll have to foreclose won't I?
4114,m18,american madness,L34787,u288,DICKSON,She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
4117,m18,american madness,L34759,u288,DICKSON,I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
4120,m18,american madness,L34749,u288,DICKSON,Listen I told you I wasn't interested in that deal didn't I?
4122,m18,american madness,L34747,u288,DICKSON,You here again? What do you want?
4135,m18,american madness,L35049,u297,MATT,And listen wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
4137,m18,american madness,L35047,u297,MATT,I remember once when your account checked.
4139,m18,american madness,L35045,u297,MATT,What's the matter Charlie?
4141,m18,american madness,L35043,u297,MATT,Where you been?
4142,m18,american madness,L34640,u297,MATT,Aw nerts!
4144,m18,american madness,L34638,u297,MATT,It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
4147,m18,american madness,L34634,u297,MATT,I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I
4149,m18,american madness,L34632,u297,MATT,Charlie!
4151,m18,american madness,L34630,u297,MATT,Let me have ten bucks?
4153,m18,american madness,L34628,u297,MATT,Say do me a favor will you Charlie?
4154,m18,american madness,L34627,u297,MATT,Here's twenty-five thousand.
4156,m18,american madness,L34625,u297,MATT,It was more than that last week.
4158,m18,american madness,L34623,u297,MATT,How much?
4160,m18,american madness,L34664,u292,HELEN,Yes sir.
4162,m18,american madness,L34662,u292,HELEN,Yes sir.
4164,m18,american madness,L34660,u292,HELEN,Not yet Mr. Clark.
4176,m18,american madness,L35540,u288,DICKSON,You know what you can do with that! Come on take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
4178,m18,american madness,L35538,u288,DICKSON,Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
4179,m18,american madness,L35483,u288,DICKSON,The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
4181,m18,american madness,L35344,u288,DICKSON,I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
4183,m18,american madness,L35340,u288,DICKSON,So that's it eh? You've waited a long time for this chance haven't you?  Well I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
4185,m18,american madness,L35338,u288,DICKSON,Aw they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
4187,m18,american madness,L35334,u288,DICKSON,I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine isn't it?
4189,m18,american madness,L35332,u288,DICKSON,I know that among you you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
4191,m18,american madness,L35330,u288,DICKSON,We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
4193,m18,american madness,L35256,u288,DICKSON,What about?
4195,m18,american madness,L34922,u288,DICKSON,Yes! You said it Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.
4197,m18,american madness,L34920,u288,DICKSON,I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
4199,m18,american madness,L34912,u288,DICKSON,Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
4200,m18,american madness,L34845,u288,DICKSON,Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
4203,m18,american madness,L34829,u288,DICKSON,What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
4204,m18,american madness,L34799,u288,DICKSON,Oh you would eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf go ahead. What's on your mind?
4206,m18,american madness,L34797,u288,DICKSON,Say you know I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand and from the inside out it's the only way you can hit anything
4207,m18,american madness,L35455,u287,CLUETT,He won't believe it Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she
4209,m18,american madness,L35453,u287,CLUETT,I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
4211,m18,american madness,L35451,u287,CLUETT,I was crazy I tell you Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me won't you Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
4212,m18,american madness,L35449,u287,CLUETT,They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
4214,m18,american madness,L35431,u287,CLUETT,Stand back Inspector. Let me out of here or I'll shoot you!
4217,m18,american madness,L35428,u287,CLUETT,Stand back Inspector or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
4220,m18,american madness,L35406,u287,CLUETT,You understand?
4222,m18,american madness,L35404,u287,CLUETT,If you don't mind Inspector I'd rather not say - that is unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see she's married.
4224,m18,american madness,L35402,u287,CLUETT,Oh yes of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
4226,m18,american madness,L35400,u287,CLUETT,That's very simple. I was home.
4228,m18,american madness,L35398,u287,CLUETT,Of course yes. Just what would you like to know Inspector?
4230,m18,american madness,L35473,u288,DICKSON,Get out get out!
4231,m18,american madness,L35472,u287,CLUETT,She wasn't to blame Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't
4232,m18,american madness,L35461,u287,CLUETT,She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
4233,m18,american madness,L35460,u288,DICKSON,You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
4234,m18,american madness,L35459,u287,CLUETT,Nothing nothing Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
4235,m18,american madness,L35458,u288,DICKSON,What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
4236,m18,american madness,L35444,u287,CLUETT,But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't Mr. Dickson!
4237,m18,american madness,L35443,u288,DICKSON,Fifty thousand dollars!
4238,m18,american madness,L35442,u287,CLUETT,Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
4239,m18,american madness,L35441,u288,DICKSON,What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
4240,m18,american madness,L35440,u287,CLUETT,I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare Mr. Dickson.
4241,m18,american madness,L35439,u288,DICKSON,Confessed! Cluett in heaven's name what got into you?
4243,m18,american madness,L34882,u287,CLUETT,But Dude listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
4245,m18,american madness,L34880,u287,CLUETT,know but
4247,m18,american madness,L34878,u287,CLUETT,Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this is there?
4249,m18,american madness,L34863,u287,CLUETT,What do you mean?
4251,m18,american madness,L34861,u287,CLUETT,Why I couldn't do that . . . !
4253,m18,american madness,L34859,u287,CLUETT,Good heavens man! You're not suggesting that I
4255,m18,american madness,L34853,u287,CLUETT,But after all you can't take blood from a stone.
4257,m18,american madness,L34851,u287,CLUETT,I'm sorry Dude butI
4259,m18,american madness,L34849,u287,CLUETT,I haven't got it.
4261,m18,american madness,L34847,u287,CLUETT,I know I know Dude. Oh I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
4263,m18,american madness,L35079,u287,CLUETT,What are you doing here?
4264,m18,american madness,L35078,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Why Matt!
4265,m18,american madness,L35077,u287,CLUETT,I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
4266,m18,american madness,L35076,u299,MRS. DICKSON,I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
4267,m18,american madness,L35075,u287,CLUETT,And now fair woman I have you in my power.
4268,m18,american madness,L35074,u287,CLUETT,A misunderstood bachelor.
4269,m18,american madness,L35073,u299,MRS. DICKSON,What is that Mr. Bones?[7]
4270,m18,american madness,L35072,u287,CLUETT,Oh you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
4271,m18,american madness,L35071,u299,MRS. DICKSON,You know there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
4272,m18,american madness,L35070,u287,CLUETT,Good for you. Come on.
4273,m18,american madness,L35069,u299,MRS. DICKSON,No. No I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy old speeches at stuffy old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big important deals  I think I will have a drink.
4274,m18,american madness,L35068,u287,CLUETT,What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
4275,m18,american madness,L35067,u299,MRS. DICKSON,No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
4276,m18,american madness,L35066,u287,CLUETT,Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink then we'll go.
4277,m18,american madness,L35065,u299,MRS. DICKSON,I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
4278,m18,american madness,L35064,u287,CLUETT,My apartment.
4279,m18,american madness,L35063,u299,MRS. DICKSON,What's this?
4280,m18,american madness,L34950,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Cyril!
4281,m18,american madness,L34949,u287,CLUETT,No. No I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer
4282,m18,american madness,L34948,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Why Cyril you're insane
4283,m18,american madness,L34947,u287,CLUETT,I've loved you ever since I can remember long before you married Tom Dickson.
4284,m18,american madness,L34946,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Now wait a minute wait a minute...
4285,m18,american madness,L34945,u287,CLUETT,Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
4286,m18,american madness,L34944,u299,MRS. DICKSON,What?
4287,m18,american madness,L34943,u287,CLUETT,I want to be near you!
4288,m18,american madness,L34942,u299,MRS. DICKSON,No.
4289,m18,american madness,L34941,u287,CLUETT,Don't you know?
4290,m18,american madness,L34940,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Why are you so anxious?
4291,m18,american madness,L34939,u287,CLUETT,No they won't. Not when you are there. Oh please be a sport. Please ask me.
4292,m18,american madness,L34938,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Don't be silly Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
4293,m18,american madness,L34937,u287,CLUETT,Now Phyllis if you don't invite me I'm coming anyway.
4294,m18,american madness,L34936,u299,MRS. DICKSON,You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
4295,m18,american madness,L34935,u287,CLUETT,Well aren't you going to invite me?
4296,m18,american madness,L34934,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Well what?
4297,m18,american madness,L34933,u287,CLUETT,Well
4298,m18,american madness,L34932,u299,MRS. DICKSON,But I'm giving a party for him - a real old-fashioned surprise party. Caps bells whistles and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
4299,m18,american madness,L34930,u287,CLUETT,Please please don't laugh at me Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
4300,m18,american madness,L34929,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Oh! Oh no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
4301,m18,american madness,L34911,u299,MRS. DICKSON,See we're getting along famously!
4302,m18,american madness,L34910,u287,CLUETT,Yes yes it does. What are you doing tonight Phyllis?
4303,m18,american madness,L34909,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Doesn't that come next?
4304,m18,american madness,L34907,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Now let me see what comes next?  Oh yes I know - what are you doing tonight Phyllis?
4305,m18,american madness,L34906,u287,CLUETT,But you see it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
4306,m18,american madness,L34905,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Come on Cyril try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
4307,m18,american madness,L34904,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
4308,m18,american madness,L34903,u287,CLUETT,Line?
4309,m18,american madness,L34902,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Not bad not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
4310,m18,american madness,L34901,u287,CLUETT,If I thought you were the slightest bit interested I would.
4311,m18,american madness,L34900,u299,MRS. DICKSON,running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming Cyril!
4312,m18,american madness,L34899,u287,CLUETT,What is?
4313,m18,american madness,L34898,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Here here here now! Don't you go back to work on me too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides it's beginning to affect your looks
4314,m18,american madness,L34897,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
4315,m18,american madness,L34896,u287,CLUETT,Well you can. You always could.
4316,m18,american madness,L34895,u299,MRS. DICKSON,For a celebrated bounder that is an awful admission. Besides I never knew that any female could do this to you .
4317,m18,american madness,L34894,u287,CLUETT,Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
4318,m18,american madness,L34893,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Me?
4319,m18,american madness,L34892,u287,CLUETT,Am I? Why I - I don't know any reason why I should be unless of course it's you . . .
4320,m18,american madness,L34891,u299,MRS. DICKSON,What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
4321,m18,american madness,L34887,u287,CLUETT,Why I needed a
4322,m18,american madness,L34886,u299,MRS. DICKSON,This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
4323,m18,american madness,L35101,u297,MATT,I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
4324,m18,american madness,L35100,u287,CLUETT,That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
4325,m18,american madness,L35099,u297,MATT,This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
4326,m18,american madness,L35098,u287,CLUETT,Phyllis you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
4327,m18,american madness,L35096,u297,MATT,No?  Then maybe you'll understand Mrs. Dickson. Oh gee he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out it'll kill him.
4328,m18,american madness,L35095,u287,CLUETT,I tell you I'm not interested in your opinion.
4329,m18,american madness,L35094,u297,MATT,You've no right to do this to her Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
4330,m18,american madness,L35093,u287,CLUETT,I'm not interested in what you think.
4331,m18,american madness,L35089,u297,MATT,Oh no Mr. Cluett if it's all the same to you I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
4332,m18,american madness,L35088,u287,CLUETT,Anything you have to say to me you can say in the morning.
4333,m18,american madness,L35086,u297,MATT,It's funny - now that I'm here I don't know just how to go about it.  You see I kind of expected to find you here alone.
4334,m18,american madness,L35085,u287,CLUETT,I'm listening.
4335,m18,american madness,L35084,u297,MATT,Well I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
4336,m18,american madness,L35081,u287,CLUETT,Oh yeah?
4337,m18,american madness,L35080,u297,MATT,The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
4338,m18,american madness,L35055,u287,CLUETT,Yes now.
4339,m18,american madness,L35054,u297,MATT,Now?
4340,m18,american madness,L35053,u287,CLUETT,Let me see your cash book will you?
4341,m18,american madness,L35052,u297,MATT,Yes sir.
4342,m18,american madness,L35051,u287,CLUETT,Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
4343,m18,american madness,L35569,u288,DICKSON,Well that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
4345,m18,american madness,L35149,u288,DICKSON,Of course let them in! You're late now.
4348,m18,american madness,L34737,u288,DICKSON,That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
4350,m18,american madness,L34735,u288,DICKSON,Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
4352,m18,american madness,L34733,u288,DICKSON,Got a handkerchief?
4354,m18,american madness,L34731,u288,DICKSON,John how's your wife this morning?
4356,m18,american madness,L35471,u299,MRS. DICKSON,In Cluett's apartment? Well dear you see I . . . I . . .
4357,m18,american madness,L35470,u288,DICKSON,Listen dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
4358,m18,american madness,L35469,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Last night? Er - why - uh last night . . .
4359,m18,american madness,L35468,u288,DICKSON,Listen dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
4360,m18,american madness,L35012,u299,MRS. DICKSON,No.
4361,m18,american madness,L35011,u288,DICKSON,Happy now?
4362,m18,american madness,L35010,u299,MRS. DICKSON,All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
4363,m18,american madness,L35006,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Tomorrow night?
4364,m18,american madness,L35005,u288,DICKSON,Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
4365,m18,american madness,L35004,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Well . . .
4366,m18,american madness,L35003,u288,DICKSON,Listen don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
4367,m18,american madness,L35002,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Ho ho ho yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it but I'm still attractive - to some.
4368,m18,american madness,L35001,u288,DICKSON,Ho! Ho! Ho!
4369,m18,american madness,L35000,u299,MRS. DICKSON,The girls!  I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
4370,m18,american madness,L34999,u288,DICKSON,You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn
4371,m18,american madness,L34998,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Yes of course.
4372,m18,american madness,L34997,u288,DICKSON,That's what it was you planned wasn't it?
4373,m18,american madness,L34996,u299,MRS. DICKSON,The theatre?
4374,m18,american madness,L34995,u288,DICKSON,Listen it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
4375,m18,american madness,L34994,u299,MRS. DICKSON,I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me and if you hadn't promised so faithfully I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
4376,m18,american madness,L34993,u288,DICKSON,But I have to go dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
4377,m18,american madness,L34992,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Now Tom you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
4378,m18,american madness,L34991,u288,DICKSON,I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry dear.
4379,m18,american madness,L34990,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Yes.
4380,m18,american madness,L34989,u288,DICKSON,Oh I did have a date with you tonight didn't I?
4381,m18,american madness,L34988,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Nothing. Tom I thought you were going out with me tonight.
4382,m18,american madness,L34987,u288,DICKSON,What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
4383,m18,american madness,L34970,u288,DICKSON,Oooh! That has the earmarks!
4384,m18,american madness,L34969,u299,MRS. DICKSON,It's amazing that your sweet lovely gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
4385,m18,american madness,L34968,u288,DICKSON,If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man what a man!
4386,m18,american madness,L34967,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Hello darling.
4387,m18,american madness,L34966,u288,DICKSON,Well look who's here! Hello dear.

4394,m18,american madness,L35487,u292,HELEN,You want the rest of those numbers Mr. Dickson?
4395,m18,american madness,L35350,u292,HELEN,Yes sir.
4396,m18,american madness,L35349,u288,DICKSON,Come on in here Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it Helen. Just as quick as you can.
4397,m18,american madness,L35153,u288,DICKSON,Now don't you worry about it.
4398,m18,american madness,L35152,u292,HELEN,In Mr. Sampson's office.
4399,m18,american madness,L35151,u288,DICKSON,Where is he now?
4400,m18,american madness,L35150,u292,HELEN,Oh Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
4401,m18,american madness,L34926,u292,HELEN,Yes sir.

4403,m18,american madness,L34775,u288,DICKSON,I haven't got any new stories for them this morning either.
4404,m18,american madness,L34774,u292,HELEN,Longer.
4405,m18,american madness,L34773,u288,DICKSON,Directors eh? Long faces?
4406,m18,american madness,L34772,u292,HELEN,Why the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
4407,m18,american madness,L34771,u288,DICKSON,Ummm. Stalling eh?  Anything new?
4408,m18,american madness,L34770,u292,HELEN,Why - well I
4409,m18,american madness,L34769,u288,DICKSON,Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
4410,m18,american madness,L34768,u292,HELEN,I don't know.
4411,m18,american madness,L34767,u288,DICKSON,Helen you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
4412,m18,american madness,L34766,u292,HELEN,Good morning.

4420,m18,american madness,L34985,u288,DICKSON,Helen I'm going to Philadelphia just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements will you?
4422,m18,american madness,L34782,u288,DICKSON,Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
4424,m18,american madness,L34777,u288,DICKSON,Ah Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
4426,m18,american madness,L34765,u288,DICKSON,Hello Helen.
4428,m18,american madness,L34763,u288,DICKSON,Got my letter?
4430,m18,american madness,L34761,u288,DICKSON,Good morning Mrs. Pembroke.
4432,m18,american madness,L35573,u288,DICKSON,Looks good. How much did it cost?

4439,m18,american madness,L34755,u288,DICKSON,My goodness you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
4441,m18,american madness,L34753,u288,DICKSON,You haven't got a uniform?
4443,m18,american madness,L34751,u288,DICKSON,Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
4444,m18,american madness,L35583,u297,MATT,Gee thanks Mr. Dickson
4445,m18,american madness,L35582,u288,DICKSON,Helen while you're downtown you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
4446,m18,american madness,L35581,u288,DICKSON,I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married I'll fire both of you.
4447,m18,american madness,L35580,u297,MATT,But I haven't . . .
4448,m18,american madness,L35579,u288,DICKSON,I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
4449,m18,american madness,L35505,u288,DICKSON,All right. That's all.  Please Matt.
4450,m18,american madness,L35504,u297,MATT,Aw I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and
4451,m18,american madness,L35503,u288,DICKSON,She was wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
4452,m18,american madness,L35502,u297,MATT,Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
4453,m18,american madness,L35501,u288,DICKSON,Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
4454,m18,american madness,L35500,u297,MATT,Listen Mr. Dickson don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is
4455,m18,american madness,L35499,u288,DICKSON,Was Mrs. Dickson there?
4456,m18,american madness,L35498,u297,MATT,Oh I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
4457,m18,american madness,L35497,u288,DICKSON,Were you in Cluett's apartment?
4458,m18,american madness,L35496,u297,MATT,You're not giving up are you Mr. Dickson?
4459,m18,american madness,L35495,u288,DICKSON,Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
4460,m18,american madness,L35494,u297,MATT,We haven't got much time left Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
4461,m18,american madness,L35308,u288,DICKSON,Yes you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on don't be a fool. Matt you trust me don't you?
4462,m18,american madness,L35307,u297,MATT,No I'm not Mr. Dickson!
4463,m18,american madness,L35306,u288,DICKSON,You're protecting somebody.
4464,m18,american madness,L35305,u297,MATT,No. I won't.
4465,m18,american madness,L35303,u297,MATT,I can't tell you.
4466,m18,american madness,L35302,u288,DICKSON,Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious son. Now come on I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on tell the truth where were you last night?
4467,m18,american madness,L35173,u288,DICKSON,There you are.
4468,m18,american madness,L35172,u297,MATT,I already told him I was home.
4469,m18,american madness,L34965,u288,DICKSON,I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too eh?
4470,m18,american madness,L34964,u297,MATT,Well I
4471,m18,american madness,L34963,u288,DICKSON,Aw go on forget it. You came through didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well when are you and Helen going to get married?
4472,m18,american madness,L34962,u297,MATT,Aw I'm sorry Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden that's all.  Sure I'm excited. I think it's great. Only well you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
4473,m18,american madness,L34961,u288,DICKSON,Say come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on fake it - even if it isn't real.
4474,m18,american madness,L34960,u297,MATT,Sure I think it's swell.
4475,m18,american madness,L34959,u288,DICKSON,What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
4476,m18,american madness,L34958,u288,DICKSON,And what's more keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought eh?
4477,m18,american madness,L34957,u297,MATT,It's all right. Thanks.
4478,m18,american madness,L35464,u288,DICKSON,You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.
4480,m18,american madness,L35462,u288,DICKSON,You're lying!
4482,m18,american madness,L35456,u288,DICKSON,My wife? What's she got to do with you?
4484,m18,american madness,L35437,u288,DICKSON,Why you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
4486,m18,american madness,L35298,u288,DICKSON,Listen Matt. If you don't tell the truth I can't help you. Where were you last night?
4488,m18,american madness,L35241,u288,DICKSON,So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they
4490,m18,american madness,L35239,u288,DICKSON,What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
4492,m18,american madness,L35175,u288,DICKSON,Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in you'll be released.  And listen don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
4494,m18,american madness,L35171,u288,DICKSON,Why certainly he can.  Matt now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night between twelve and twelve-thirty and everything will be all right.
4496,m18,american madness,L35169,u288,DICKSON,All right. If the boy proves an alibi he's all right isn't he?
4498,m18,american madness,L35167,u288,DICKSON,What time did this thing happen?
4499,m18,american madness,L35159,u288,DICKSON,Yes.
4501,m18,american madness,L35157,u288,DICKSON,Why pick on him ?
4503,m18,american madness,L35155,u288,DICKSON,What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
4504,m18,american madness,L35348,u288,DICKSON,I hate to do this but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
4506,m18,american madness,L35346,u288,DICKSON,Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
4508,m18,american madness,L35327,u288,DICKSON,Don't you think I know it?
4510,m18,american madness,L35317,u288,DICKSON,I'll talk to them. Listen go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.
4512,m18,american madness,L35315,u288,DICKSON,The fools! If they only knew it they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor and they lose their heads.
4514,m18,american madness,L35313,u288,DICKSON,Mine too?
4516,m18,american madness,L35311,u288,DICKSON,Did you get the case for the securities?
4519,m18,american madness,L35252,u288,DICKSON,The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
4521,m18,american madness,L35250,u288,DICKSON,All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
4523,m18,american madness,L35247,u288,DICKSON,What are you talking about?
4526,m18,american madness,L35025,u288,DICKSON,How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open come in and sign this thing or I'll call this whole deal off.
4528,m18,american madness,L35023,u288,DICKSON,That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
4530,m18,american madness,L35021,u288,DICKSON,Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
4532,m18,american madness,L35019,u288,DICKSON,Well Sampson what is it?
4540,m18,american madness,L34877,u292,HELEN,All right.
4541,m18,american madness,L34876,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Oh well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
4542,m18,american madness,L34875,u292,HELEN,Hardly.
4543,m18,american madness,L34874,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Well take my word for it and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman I could handle her but after all you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now can you?
4544,m18,american madness,L34873,u292,HELEN,No.
4545,m18,american madness,L34872,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Helen did you ever try competing with a bank?
4546,m18,american madness,L34871,u292,HELEN,I'm afraid so.
4547,m18,american madness,L34870,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Board meeting. Oh that means hours I suppose.
4548,m18,american madness,L34869,u292,HELEN,He's at a board meeting.
4549,m18,american madness,L34868,u299,MRS. DICKSON,Is that busy husband of mine busy?
4550,m18,american madness,L34867,u292,HELEN,How-do-you-do Mrs. Dickson.
4551,m18,american madness,L35523,u292,HELEN,Matt look! There's Mr. Jones!
4552,m18,american madness,L35522,u297,MATT,The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him who is going to help him?
4553,m18,american madness,L35521,u292,HELEN,Mr. Williams . . .
4554,m18,american madness,L35520,u297,MATT,Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
4555,m18,american madness,L35507,u297,MATT,Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on let's get to a telephone.
4556,m18,american madness,L35506,u292,HELEN,Did you talk to him?
4557,m18,american madness,L35493,u297,MATT,Sure they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
4558,m18,american madness,L35492,u292,HELEN,Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
4559,m18,american madness,L35491,u297,MATT,They must have turned him down.
4560,m18,american madness,L35490,u292,HELEN,Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
4561,m18,american madness,L35489,u297,MATT,What's he doing honey? Is he getting any help?
4562,m18,american madness,L35369,u297,MATT,Don't cry honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
4563,m18,american madness,L35368,u292,HELEN,Oh Matt . . .
4564,m18,american madness,L35042,u297,MATT,All right dear.
4565,m18,american madness,L35041,u292,HELEN,Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
4566,m18,american madness,L35040,u297,MATT,Okay honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that
4567,m18,american madness,L35039,u292,HELEN,Now you've got me worried dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
4568,m18,american madness,L35038,u297,MATT,Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
4569,m18,american madness,L35037,u292,HELEN,Oh now don't be silly.
4570,m18,american madness,L35036,u297,MATT,Who? Cluett? No not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked horse dollar.[6]
4571,m18,american madness,L35035,u292,HELEN,Say Matt you haven't done anything about what you saw today have you?
4572,m18,american madness,L35034,u297,MATT,Oh Charlie again.
4573,m18,american madness,L35033,u292,HELEN,What's keeping you?
4574,m18,american madness,L34981,u297,MATT,Yes right in his office the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
4575,m18,american madness,L34980,u292,HELEN,In Cluett's office?
4576,m18,american madness,L34979,u297,MATT,I tell you I saw them!
4577,m18,american madness,L34978,u292,HELEN,Oh Matt you must be mistaken.
4578,m18,american madness,L34977,u297,MATT,Well he was making love to her.
4579,m18,american madness,L34976,u292,HELEN,Well . . . ?
4580,m18,american madness,L34975,u297,MATT,Come here.  You know a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
4581,m18,american madness,L34974,u292,HELEN,What's the matter Matt? Gee I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
4582,m18,american madness,L34973,u297,MATT,Yeah.
4583,m18,american madness,L34972,u292,HELEN,What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
4584,m18,american madness,L34955,u297,MATT,Yeah swell.
4585,m18,american madness,L34954,u292,HELEN,Say I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
4586,m18,american madness,L34704,u292,HELEN,Oh Matt.
4587,m18,american madness,L34703,u297,MATT,All right I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
4588,m18,american madness,L34702,u292,HELEN,Yes.
4589,m18,american madness,L34701,u297,MATT,Oh you think I'm lying?
4590,m18,american madness,L34700,u292,HELEN,No.
4591,m18,american madness,L34699,u297,MATT,A friend of mine - yeah really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying would you believe it?
4592,m18,american madness,L34698,u292,HELEN,Yes.
4593,m18,american madness,L34697,u297,MATT,Oh ten dollars
4594,m18,american madness,L34696,u292,HELEN,The ten dollars.
4595,m18,american madness,L34695,u297,MATT,With what?
4596,m18,american madness,L34694,u292,HELEN,What did you do with it?
4597,m18,american madness,L34651,u292,HELEN,Oh is that so?
4598,m18,american madness,L34650,u297,MATT,Hey look out somebody's likely to see us!
4599,m18,american madness,L34649,u292,HELEN,Come here honey!
4600,m18,american madness,L34648,u297,MATT,Why?
4601,m18,american madness,L34647,u292,HELEN,Matt come here!
4602,m18,american madness,L34646,u297,MATT,Hello Helen!
4603,m18,american madness,L35385,u292,HELEN,Yes sir.
4605,m18,american madness,L35383,u292,HELEN,He came to see Mr. Cluett.
4607,m18,american madness,L35381,u292,HELEN,He was in the bank yesterday.
4609,m18,american madness,L35379,u292,HELEN,Did you say Dude Finlay?
4637,m18,american madness,L35300,u297,MATT,But I wasn't here Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
4638,m18,american madness,L35266,u297,MATT,Yes.
4640,m18,american madness,L35264,u297,MATT,Well about - uh - eleven o'clock.
4642,m18,american madness,L35262,u297,MATT,Yes.
4644,m18,american madness,L35165,u297,MATT,I don't know.
4647,m18,american madness,L35141,u297,MATT,I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
4649,m18,american madness,L35139,u297,MATT,wasn't anywhere near this place
4651,m18,american madness,L35527,u297,MATT,They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
4654,m18,american madness,L35030,u297,MATT,Where's Charlie?
4656,m18,american madness,L35028,u297,MATT,Everybody in?
4657,m18,american madness,L34645,u297,MATT,Bought himself a pocketbook!
4659,m18,american madness,L34643,u297,MATT,That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
4660,m18,american madness,L34620,u297,MATT,You've got enough?
4662,m18,american madness,L34618,u297,MATT,How are you fixed?
4664,m18,american madness,L34616,u297,MATT,You're carrying too much money on you Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
10839,m35,blast from the past,L93292,u547,ADAM,She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
10841,m35,blast from the past,L93290,u547,ADAM,No I'm not! My mom taught me.
10843,m35,blast from the past,L93286,u547,ADAM,Really?
10846,m35,blast from the past,L93279,u547,ADAM,I'm Adam Webber.
10848,m35,blast from the past,L93277,u547,ADAM,Thank-Q!
10850,m35,blast from the past,L93275,u547,ADAM,You like it?
10852,m35,blast from the past,L93273,u547,ADAM,I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
10854,m35,blast from the past,L93271,u547,ADAM,Hi!
10856,m35,blast from the past,L93481,u547,ADAM,The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
10857,m35,blast from the past,L93463,u547,ADAM,Yes ma'am.
10859,m35,blast from the past,L93457,u547,ADAM,I thank you very much for the invitation but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
10861,m35,blast from the past,L93455,u547,ADAM,For how long?
10863,m35,blast from the past,L93453,u547,ADAM,Come where?
10866,m35,blast from the past,L93449,u547,ADAM,Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
10868,m35,blast from the past,L93447,u547,ADAM,How do you do?
10871,m35,blast from the past,L93341,u547,ADAM,It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
10874,m35,blast from the past,L93333,u547,ADAM,Cliff I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
10876,m35,blast from the past,L93329,u547,ADAM,I'm sorry and legs. Legs butt and hair.  Well isn't he?  And shallow as well?
10878,m35,blast from the past,L93327,u547,ADAM,Eve I don't mean to be rude and please excuse me Cliff but Eve isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
10880,m35,blast from the past,L93325,u547,ADAM,Please excuse this interruption.
10882,m35,blast from the past,L93319,u547,ADAM,Thank you very much. But Cliff that's my seat. And I was just--
10885,m35,blast from the past,L93045,u547,ADAM,How do you do?
10886,m35,blast from the past,L93595,u547,ADAM,My mother's like that.
10887,m35,blast from the past,L93594,u556,EVE,We can make this work Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
10888,m35,blast from the past,L93593,u547,ADAM,See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
10889,m35,blast from the past,L93592,u556,EVE,No.
10890,m35,blast from the past,L93461,u547,ADAM,Could I please just go home?  I was lost but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
10891,m35,blast from the past,L93460,u556,EVE,...I do.
10892,m35,blast from the past,L93459,u547,ADAM,...All right Eve.  If you say so.
10893,m35,blast from the past,L93458,u556,EVE,Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
10894,m35,blast from the past,L93445,u556,EVE,Hi Adam.  This is uh....
10895,m35,blast from the past,L93444,u547,ADAM,Hi Eve!
10896,m35,blast from the past,L93427,u556,EVE,Neat. Goodnight!
10897,m35,blast from the past,L93426,u547,ADAM,And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
10898,m35,blast from the past,L93425,u556,EVE,Really?  Okay!
10899,m35,blast from the past,L93424,u547,ADAM,It was at least as good as the sky.
10900,m35,blast from the past,L93423,u556,EVE,My pleasure.
10901,m35,blast from the past,L93422,u547,ADAM,Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
10902,m35,blast from the past,L93421,u556,EVE,That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
10903,m35,blast from the past,L93420,u547,ADAM,Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
10904,m35,blast from the past,L93419,u556,EVE,I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
10905,m35,blast from the past,L93418,u547,ADAM,Yes Eve?
10906,m35,blast from the past,L93417,u556,EVE,Uh-huh. Adam?
10907,m35,blast from the past,L93414,u547,ADAM,No.
10908,m35,blast from the past,L93413,u556,EVE,Adam...dumb question but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
10909,m35,blast from the past,L93411,u556,EVE,Sing it to me.
10910,m35,blast from the past,L93409,u556,EVE,Is that what you call it?
10911,m35,blast from the past,L93408,u547,ADAM,I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
10912,m35,blast from the past,L93406,u547,ADAM,Thanks.
10913,m35,blast from the past,L93405,u556,EVE,There.
10914,m35,blast from the past,L93403,u556,EVE,Well you had better!!
10915,m35,blast from the past,L93402,u547,ADAM,I know first aid!
10916,m35,blast from the past,L93401,u556,EVE,Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
10917,m35,blast from the past,L93400,u547,ADAM,Eve if you'll let me I can --
10918,m35,blast from the past,L93399,u556,EVE,Goodnight!
10919,m35,blast from the past,L93398,u547,ADAM,What?
10920,m35,blast from the past,L93397,u556,EVE,Well you should be!  Thanks to you my heart is in my neck!
10921,m35,blast from the past,L93396,u547,ADAM,I know...and I'm really sorry.
10922,m35,blast from the past,L93395,u556,EVE,What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
10923,m35,blast from the past,L93394,u547,ADAM,I'm really sorry!
10924,m35,blast from the past,L93393,u556,EVE,Scare me why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
10925,m35,blast from the past,L93392,u547,ADAM,Eve?!
10926,m35,blast from the past,L93348,u556,EVE,And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
10927,m35,blast from the past,L93347,u547,ADAM,But Eve I would--
10928,m35,blast from the past,L93346,u556,EVE,I'm leaving too.
10929,m35,blast from the past,L93344,u547,ADAM,Eve I'm sorry.
10930,m35,blast from the past,L93343,u556,EVE,I don't blame you!
10931,m35,blast from the past,L93339,u547,ADAM,I'm sorry.
10932,m35,blast from the past,L93338,u556,EVE,Adam?!
10933,m35,blast from the past,L93314,u547,ADAM,All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
10934,m35,blast from the past,L93313,u556,EVE,I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
10935,m35,blast from the past,L93312,u547,ADAM,No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
10936,m35,blast from the past,L93311,u556,EVE,You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
10937,m35,blast from the past,L93310,u547,ADAM,I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe but I've never lied.
10938,m35,blast from the past,L93309,u556,EVE,Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
10939,m35,blast from the past,L93308,u547,ADAM,Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
10940,m35,blast from the past,L93307,u556,EVE,You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people are there?!
10941,m35,blast from the past,L93306,u547,ADAM,You wanted to see me!
10942,m35,blast from the past,L93268,u556,EVE,Did you?
10943,m35,blast from the past,L93267,u547,ADAM,Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
10944,m35,blast from the past,L93266,u556,EVE,What?
10945,m35,blast from the past,L93263,u556,EVE,Say something surprising. And funny. Lie if need be.
10946,m35,blast from the past,L93262,u547,ADAM,Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
10947,m35,blast from the past,L93261,u556,EVE,Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
10948,m35,blast from the past,L93259,u556,EVE,Maybe. But that's how it works.
10949,m35,blast from the past,L93258,u547,ADAM,That's ridiculous.
10950,m35,blast from the past,L93256,u547,ADAM,Really?
10951,m35,blast from the past,L93253,u547,ADAM,What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
10952,m35,blast from the past,L93252,u556,EVE,Yeah sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
10953,m35,blast from the past,L93251,u547,ADAM,Okay. I like that.
10954,m35,blast from the past,L93246,u547,ADAM,How 'bout this one?
10955,m35,blast from the past,L93245,u556,EVE,Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk the jewelry the fingernails.  Please!
10956,m35,blast from the past,L93244,u547,ADAM,Yes I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
10957,m35,blast from the past,L93242,u547,ADAM,Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
10958,m35,blast from the past,L93241,u556,EVE,No way.
10959,m35,blast from the past,L93240,u547,ADAM,What about her?
10960,m35,blast from the past,L93239,u547,ADAM,It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink I'm told.
10961,m35,blast from the past,L93238,u556,EVE,What have you ordered?
10962,m35,blast from the past,L93237,u556,EVE,And don't be so obvious!
10963,m35,blast from the past,L93236,u547,ADAM,I like her.
10964,m35,blast from the past,L93235,u556,EVE,Not that one!
10965,m35,blast from the past,L93234,u547,ADAM,I thought I was here to meet women.
10966,m35,blast from the past,L93232,u547,ADAM,Good-bye!
10967,m35,blast from the past,L93231,u556,EVE,Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
10968,m35,blast from the past,L93211,u556,EVE,Yes!
10969,m35,blast from the past,L93210,u547,ADAM,Do I look crazy?
10970,m35,blast from the past,L93209,u556,EVE,No!  Not crazy!
10971,m35,blast from the past,L93205,u556,EVE,Look unimpressed.
10972,m35,blast from the past,L93204,u547,ADAM,My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
10973,m35,blast from the past,L93197,u556,EVE,Well...yeah. Okay.
10974,m35,blast from the past,L93196,u547,ADAM,Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
10975,m35,blast from the past,L93195,u556,EVE,Hey screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen let me tell you something--
10976,m35,blast from the past,L93194,u547,ADAM,Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
10977,m35,blast from the past,L93193,u556,EVE,Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
10978,m35,blast from the past,L93192,u547,ADAM,No it's not!
10979,m35,blast from the past,L93191,u556,EVE,Okay. But you know this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous don't you think?
10980,m35,blast from the past,L93190,u547,ADAM,I certainly do!
10981,m35,blast from the past,L93189,u556,EVE,Yeah? No kidding. Listen you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
10982,m35,blast from the past,L93188,u547,ADAM,Yep.  You know my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
10983,m35,blast from the past,L93186,u547,ADAM,Hey Eve!
10984,m35,blast from the past,L93179,u547,ADAM,Okay!
10985,m35,blast from the past,L93178,u556,EVE,He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
10986,m35,blast from the past,L93166,u547,ADAM,It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake Eve take your foot off the chair!
10987,m35,blast from the past,L93165,u556,EVE,What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
10988,m35,blast from the past,L93162,u547,ADAM,Whatever you two want. If you've got the time I've got the wazoo.
10989,m35,blast from the past,L93161,u556,EVE,Yeah.
10990,m35,blast from the past,L93160,u547,ADAM,About clothing?
10991,m35,blast from the past,L93151,u556,EVE,That's boring!
10992,m35,blast from the past,L93150,u547,ADAM,The guy with the underpants!
10993,m35,blast from the past,L93140,u556,EVE,Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer grunge hip- hop Euro trash?
10994,m35,blast from the past,L93139,u547,ADAM,The what?
10995,m35,blast from the past,L93136,u556,EVE,So what are you seeing?
10996,m35,blast from the past,L93135,u547,ADAM,All right.
10997,m35,blast from the past,L93111,u556,EVE,Uh...yeah.
10998,m35,blast from the past,L93110,u547,ADAM,May I please be excused?
10999,m35,blast from the past,L93109,u556,EVE,No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course in the house.  It's in there.
11000,m35,blast from the past,L93108,u547,ADAM,In the house?
11001,m35,blast from the past,L93107,u556,EVE,Sure.
11002,m35,blast from the past,L93106,u547,ADAM,He has a computer?
11003,m35,blast from the past,L93105,u556,EVE,He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
11004,m35,blast from the past,L93104,u547,ADAM,Where's he gone?
11005,m35,blast from the past,L93093,u547,ADAM,Good for you.
11006,m35,blast from the past,L93092,u556,EVE,Yeah right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay by the way.
11007,m35,blast from the past,L93085,u547,ADAM,Wow.
11008,m35,blast from the past,L93084,u556,EVE,You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
11009,m35,blast from the past,L93083,u547,ADAM,Yes!
11010,m35,blast from the past,L93082,u556,EVE,I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
11011,m35,blast from the past,L93081,u547,ADAM,Um-hum.
11012,m35,blast from the past,L93080,u556,EVE,Okay let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
11013,m35,blast from the past,L93065,u547,ADAM,Well I know Mom sure likes 'em!
11014,m35,blast from the past,L93064,u556,EVE,I thought only hookers drank those things.
11015,m35,blast from the past,L93063,u547,ADAM,Thank-Q!
11016,m35,blast from the past,L93062,u556,EVE,Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
11017,m35,blast from the past,L93052,u556,EVE,What?!
11018,m35,blast from the past,L93051,u547,ADAM,Actuallyno. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
11019,m35,blast from the past,L93050,u556,EVE,He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know isn't it?
11020,m35,blast from the past,L93049,u547,ADAM,Why thank you!  Very nice to have met you Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
11021,m35,blast from the past,L93036,u547,ADAM,I like it.
11022,m35,blast from the past,L93035,u556,EVE,Yes!
11023,m35,blast from the past,L93034,u547,ADAM,Is this your house?
11024,m35,blast from the past,L93033,u556,EVE,I was wrong!!
11025,m35,blast from the past,L93032,u547,ADAM,You said it would be easy!
11026,m35,blast from the past,L93031,u556,EVE,Never drive again!
11027,m35,blast from the past,L93030,u547,ADAM,I told you I've never driven before!
11028,m35,blast from the past,L93029,u556,EVE,You almost got us killed!
11029,m35,blast from the past,L93028,u547,ADAM,Sorry!
11030,m35,blast from the past,L93027,u556,EVE,Stop that ma'am crap!
11031,m35,blast from the past,L93026,u547,ADAM,Yes ma'am!
11032,m35,blast from the past,L93025,u556,EVE,Now get out!!
11033,m35,blast from the past,L93024,u547,ADAM,The engine is still running.
11034,m35,blast from the past,L93023,u556,EVE,Get out!
11035,m35,blast from the past,L93022,u556,EVE,Thank you.
11036,m35,blast from the past,L93021,u547,ADAM,Of course.
11037,m35,blast from the past,L93020,u556,EVE,Could we talk about that a little later?
11038,m35,blast from the past,L93018,u547,ADAM,That's what I was afraid of.
11039,m35,blast from the past,L93017,u556,EVE,Well I could probably get you laid in two weeks but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
11040,m35,blast from the past,L93016,u547,ADAM,Two weeks.
11041,m35,blast from the past,L93015,u556,EVE,When do you need her by?
11042,m35,blast from the past,L93014,u547,ADAM,And if possible I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
11043,m35,blast from the past,L93013,u556,EVE,No dogs huh? Okay.
11044,m35,blast from the past,L93012,u547,ADAM,One who's not a mutant.
11045,m35,blast from the past,L93011,u556,EVE,I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
11046,m35,blast from the past,L93010,u547,ADAM,It didn't used to be that way.
11047,m35,blast from the past,L93009,u556,EVE,Everybody's divorced.
11048,m35,blast from the past,L93008,u547,ADAM,They're all divorced?
11049,m35,blast from the past,L93007,u556,EVE,Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
11050,m35,blast from the past,L93006,u547,ADAM,I didn't know that.
11051,m35,blast from the past,L93005,u556,EVE,Sure.
11052,m35,blast from the past,L93004,u547,ADAM,It does?
11053,m35,blast from the past,L93003,u556,EVE,The big one!
11054,m35,blast from the past,L93002,u547,ADAM,Bites what?
11055,m35,blast from the past,L93001,u556,EVE,You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
11056,m35,blast from the past,L93000,u547,ADAM,I don't want to be alone.
11057,m35,blast from the past,L92999,u556,EVE,Why?!
11058,m35,blast from the past,L92998,u547,ADAM,Because I want to get married.
11059,m35,blast from the past,L92997,u556,EVE,What for?
11060,m35,blast from the past,L92996,u547,ADAM,Yes.
11061,m35,blast from the past,L92995,u556,EVE,A wife?
11062,m35,blast from the past,L92994,u547,ADAM,Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
11063,m35,blast from the past,L92993,u556,EVE,Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
11064,m35,blast from the past,L92992,u547,ADAM,This is for me.
11065,m35,blast from the past,L92991,u556,EVE,No no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
11066,m35,blast from the past,L92990,u547,ADAM,Then forget it.
11067,m35,blast from the past,L92989,u556,EVE,Oh I'm sure it will!
11068,m35,blast from the past,L92988,u547,ADAM,Well this is going to sound a little crazy.
11069,m35,blast from the past,L92987,u556,EVE,Name it.
11070,m35,blast from the past,L92986,u547,ADAM,There's something else I would like you to help me with.
11071,m35,blast from the past,L92985,u556,EVE,Now let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
11072,m35,blast from the past,L92984,u547,ADAM,Okay.
11073,m35,blast from the past,L92983,u556,EVE,Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean but believe me it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
11074,m35,blast from the past,L92982,u547,ADAM,And um ...I guess... I guess you and I uh...
11075,m35,blast from the past,L92981,u556,EVE,Thank you.
11076,m35,blast from the past,L92980,u547,ADAM,You know Eve -- don't get mad okay? - -  but I'd just be lost without you.
11077,m35,blast from the past,L92979,u556,EVE,No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
11078,m35,blast from the past,L92978,u547,ADAM,I guess we'll need another locker.
11079,m35,blast from the past,L92977,u556,EVE,It's your life.  And by the way it's a dandy.
11080,m35,blast from the past,L92976,u547,ADAM,We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
11081,m35,blast from the past,L92974,u556,EVE,Night!
11082,m35,blast from the past,L92973,u547,ADAM,Hey you know. I was thinking...
11083,m35,blast from the past,L92972,u556,EVE,Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
11084,m35,blast from the past,L92971,u547,ADAM,Sorry.
11085,m35,blast from the past,L92970,u556,EVE,Well another day another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
11086,m35,blast from the past,L92969,u556,EVE,What?
11087,m35,blast from the past,L92968,u547,ADAM,Wait! Wait!
11088,m35,blast from the past,L92966,u547,ADAM,Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
11089,m35,blast from the past,L92965,u556,EVE,Very funny smart ass.
11090,m35,blast from the past,L92964,u547,ADAM,My Mom and Dad.
11091,m35,blast from the past,L92963,u556,EVE,Who are these people?
11092,m35,blast from the past,L92962,u547,ADAM,They like Dr. Pepper.
11093,m35,blast from the past,L92961,u556,EVE,Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
11094,m35,blast from the past,L92955,u556,EVE,Sure.
11095,m35,blast from the past,L92954,u547,ADAM,You got it! Wait here while I change.
11096,m35,blast from the past,L92953,u556,EVE,I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
11097,m35,blast from the past,L92952,u547,ADAM,What's fair?
11098,m35,blast from the past,L92951,u556,EVE,What's the pay?
11099,m35,blast from the past,L92950,u547,ADAM,Two weeks.
11100,m35,blast from the past,L92949,u556,EVE,How long would you need me?
11101,m35,blast from the past,L92948,u547,ADAM,Well they're not starving yet but they need help.
11102,m35,blast from the past,L92947,u556,EVE,Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
11103,m35,blast from the past,L92946,u547,ADAM,Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
11104,m35,blast from the past,L92945,u556,EVE,Doing what?
11105,m35,blast from the past,L92944,u547,ADAM,Why not go to work for me?
11106,m35,blast from the past,L92943,u556,EVE,It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking but even more shallow than I am if you can picture that. Now if you'll excuse me I have to go find another low-paying demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
11107,m35,blast from the past,L92942,u547,ADAM,...Okay.
11108,m35,blast from the past,L92941,u556,EVE,Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
11109,m35,blast from the past,L92940,u547,ADAM,Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
11110,m35,blast from the past,L92939,u556,EVE,What?
11111,m35,blast from the past,L92938,u547,ADAM,Why doesn't it never work out?

11138,m35,blast from the past,L92876,u556,EVE,I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
11139,m35,blast from the past,L92875,u547,ADAM,Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!

11162,m35,blast from the past,L92852,u556,EVE,So for four thousand dollars all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
11163,m35,blast from the past,L92851,u547,ADAM,So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out too.
11164,m35,blast from the past,L92850,u556,EVE,Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
11165,m35,blast from the past,L92849,u547,ADAM,He's all yours. I was holding him back.

11173,m35,blast from the past,L92841,u547,ADAM,If it will make you feel any better I don't have a gun.
11174,m35,blast from the past,L92840,u556,EVE,I'm not taking you there Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.

11182,m35,blast from the past,L92832,u556,EVE,I knew it! So anyhow you get on a bus and before you know it you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
11183,m35,blast from the past,L92831,u547,ADAM,Right.
11184,m35,blast from the past,L92830,u556,EVE,Yes I'm right?
11185,m35,blast from the past,L92829,u547,ADAM,So far?
11186,m35,blast from the past,L92828,u556,EVE,Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because like an idiot you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
11187,m35,blast from the past,L92827,u547,ADAM,Oh that's nice.
11188,m35,blast from the past,L92826,u556,EVE,Well I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
11189,m35,blast from the past,L92825,u547,ADAM,I don't know. Why doesn't it?
11190,m35,blast from the past,L92824,u556,EVE,Why doesn't that surprise me?
11191,m35,blast from the past,L92823,u547,ADAM,I came on a bus.
11192,m35,blast from the past,L92822,u556,EVE,Here pick these up!
11193,m35,blast from the past,L92821,u547,ADAM,I just had a mental picture of...
11194,m35,blast from the past,L92820,u556,EVE,What's wrong with you?
11195,m35,blast from the past,L92819,u556,EVE,A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
11196,m35,blast from the past,L92818,u547,ADAM,Dickhead?
11197,m35,blast from the past,L92817,u556,EVE,Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
11198,m35,blast from the past,L92816,u547,ADAM,Say...did you just lose your job because of me?
11199,m35,blast from the past,L92815,u556,EVE,You're lost?
11200,m35,blast from the past,L92814,u547,ADAM,No I'm lost.
11201,m35,blast from the past,L92813,u556,EVE,We? I'm going home. And judging by that coat I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
11202,m35,blast from the past,L92812,u547,ADAM,Where are we going?
11203,m35,blast from the past,L92805,u547,ADAM,Yes ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
11204,m35,blast from the past,L92804,u556,EVE,Come on Heathcliff I'll walk you to the corner.

11206,m35,blast from the past,L92796,u547,ADAM,Get out of here!
11207,m35,blast from the past,L92795,u556,EVE,Well your business must not be sports memorabilia because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
11208,m35,blast from the past,L92794,u547,ADAM,No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
11209,m35,blast from the past,L92793,u556,EVE,Are you French?
11210,m35,blast from the past,L92792,u547,ADAM,Bon soir mademoiselle!

11216,m35,blast from the past,L92767,u547,ADAM,Nothing.
11218,m35,blast from the past,L92765,u547,ADAM,Is this because of the radiation?
11219,m35,blast from the past,L92762,u547,ADAM,Gee-ma-nee!
11221,m35,blast from the past,L92760,u547,ADAM,Is that a birthday cake?!
11223,m35,blast from the past,L93500,u547,ADAM,I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
11224,m35,blast from the past,L92723,u547,ADAM,I promise.
11226,m35,blast from the past,L92721,u547,ADAM,How do I leave here?
11228,m35,blast from the past,L92719,u547,ADAM,That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
11230,m35,blast from the past,L92717,u547,ADAM,I've got to go now.
11232,m35,blast from the past,L92715,u547,ADAM,I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
11234,m35,blast from the past,L92713,u547,ADAM,All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
11236,m35,blast from the past,L92711,u547,ADAM,Are you all right?
11237,m35,blast from the past,L93625,u553,CALVIN,Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those uh...  They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!
11238,m35,blast from the past,L93624,u547,ADAM,Uh I think they have.
11239,m35,blast from the past,L93622,u553,CALVIN,Uh-huh.
11240,m35,blast from the past,L93621,u547,ADAM,Yes. That's kind of how it was.
11241,m35,blast from the past,L93619,u547,ADAM,Yes sir. It's true.
11242,m35,blast from the past,L93618,u553,CALVIN,That's what everybody believes?
11243,m35,blast from the past,L93617,u547,ADAM,Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
11244,m35,blast from the past,L93616,u553,CALVIN,You're sure?
11245,m35,blast from the past,L93615,u547,ADAM,Dad I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while but I think...Dadthere was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
11246,m35,blast from the past,L93614,u553,CALVIN,Uh-huh.
11247,m35,blast from the past,L93613,u547,ADAM,It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
11248,m35,blast from the past,L93612,u553,CALVIN,This is great son just great. By the way Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov that's not Russian is it?
11249,m35,blast from the past,L93568,u553,CALVIN,Well in that case...of course son.
11250,m35,blast from the past,L93567,u547,ADAM,And I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
11251,m35,blast from the past,L93566,u553,CALVIN,But I don't understand.
11252,m35,blast from the past,L92710,u547,ADAM,I'll try.
11253,m35,blast from the past,L92709,u553,CALVIN,One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman bring her back with you.
11254,m35,blast from the past,L92708,u547,ADAM,I promise. Is that all?
11255,m35,blast from the past,L92707,u553,CALVIN,Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
11256,m35,blast from the past,L92706,u547,ADAM,Adult Bookstore.  Why?
11257,m35,blast from the past,L92704,u547,ADAM,Yes sir.  Is that all?
11258,m35,blast from the past,L92703,u553,CALVIN,...the pipe tobacco.
11259,m35,blast from the past,L92702,u547,ADAM,Yes father?! Yes?

11262,m35,blast from the past,L92630,u553,CALVIN,C'est bon Monsieur.
11263,m35,blast from the past,L92625,u547,ADAM,Shit is a French word?
11264,m35,blast from the past,L92624,u553,CALVIN,Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
11265,m35,blast from the past,L92622,u553,CALVIN,No son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
11266,m35,blast from the past,L92621,u547,ADAM,Well do we just go on up?!
11267,m35,blast from the past,L92591,u547,ADAM,These are really swell! I mean swell!
11268,m35,blast from the past,L92590,u553,CALVIN,Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!

11272,m35,blast from the past,L92584,u547,ADAM,Oh boy! A jacket!
11273,m35,blast from the past,L92582,u553,CALVIN,Blow out the candles!
11274,m35,blast from the past,L92581,u547,ADAM,Thank you Mom! Thanks Dad!
11275,m35,blast from the past,L92576,u553,CALVIN,Because he must!
11276,m35,blast from the past,L92575,u547,ADAM,Then why go there?
11277,m35,blast from the past,L92574,u553,CALVIN,Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
11278,m35,blast from the past,L92573,u547,ADAM,Why?
11279,m35,blast from the past,L92572,u553,CALVIN,No no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
11280,m35,blast from the past,L92565,u553,CALVIN,No. Sit down.
11281,m35,blast from the past,L92564,u547,ADAM,The nocturnal flying mammal?
11282,m35,blast from the past,L92563,u553,CALVIN,Uh no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
11283,m35,blast from the past,L92562,u547,ADAM,Like one of Mom's?
11284,m35,blast from the past,L92561,u553,CALVIN,No son. A pitcher.
11285,m35,blast from the past,L92560,u547,ADAM,Like a painting?
11286,m35,blast from the past,L92559,u553,CALVIN,It's a game son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
11287,m35,blast from the past,L92558,u547,ADAM,What's baseball?
11288,m35,blast from the past,L92557,u553,CALVIN,It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
11289,m35,blast from the past,L92556,u547,ADAM,These are wonderful.
11290,m35,blast from the past,L92553,u553,CALVIN,You know you have a wonderful sense of humor son!  I must say the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way it's time I gave you something. Come with me.

11308,m35,blast from the past,L93441,u567,TROY,I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
11309,m35,blast from the past,L93440,u547,ADAM,No I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
11310,m35,blast from the past,L93439,u567,TROY,A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
11311,m35,blast from the past,L93438,u547,ADAM,What?
11312,m35,blast from the past,L93437,u567,TROY,So did you buy a movie?
11313,m35,blast from the past,L93436,u547,ADAM,You bet!
11314,m35,blast from the past,L93435,u567,TROY,How 'bout we check with Eve first?
11315,m35,blast from the past,L93434,u547,ADAM,Okay Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
11316,m35,blast from the past,L93431,u547,ADAM,No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
11317,m35,blast from the past,L93430,u567,TROY,I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
11318,m35,blast from the past,L93265,u547,ADAM,Okay. Thank you my friends.
11319,m35,blast from the past,L93264,u567,TROY,Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
11320,m35,blast from the past,L93203,u547,ADAM,Ladies first Troy! That was close.
11321,m35,blast from the past,L93202,u567,TROY,What?!
11322,m35,blast from the past,L93201,u547,ADAM,Oh. I see.
11323,m35,blast from the past,L93200,u567,TROY,Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
11324,m35,blast from the past,L93199,u547,ADAM,Why did you park way back there?
11325,m35,blast from the past,L93183,u547,ADAM,I LOVE THIS!!
11326,m35,blast from the past,L93182,u567,TROY,That's why little things mean so much to him.
11327,m35,blast from the past,L93171,u547,ADAM,Amazing. I'm very impressed.
11328,m35,blast from the past,L93170,u567,TROY,The recovery? Oh  yeah! Hey they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
11329,m35,blast from the past,L93169,u547,ADAM,The recovery is very impressive.
11330,m35,blast from the past,L93168,u567,TROY,Almost all of them.
11331,m35,blast from the past,L93167,u547,ADAM,I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
11332,m35,blast from the past,L93164,u547,ADAM,No.
11333,m35,blast from the past,L93163,u567,TROY,Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
11334,m35,blast from the past,L93156,u567,TROY,Okay.
11335,m35,blast from the past,L93155,u547,ADAM,I just don't want to.
11336,m35,blast from the past,L93154,u567,TROY,Why not? He has great pants.
11337,m35,blast from the past,L93153,u547,ADAM,I'm not wearing his pants.
11338,m35,blast from the past,L93152,u567,TROY,Not on him.
11339,m35,blast from the past,L93129,u567,TROY,True.
11340,m35,blast from the past,L93128,u547,ADAM,...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
11341,m35,blast from the past,L93127,u567,TROY,Well I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
11342,m35,blast from the past,L93126,u547,ADAM,Yes. He likes windows.
11343,m35,blast from the past,L93125,u567,TROY,He's a Windows guy then huh?
11344,m35,blast from the past,L93124,u547,ADAM,Oh yes.  It would probably kill him.
11345,m35,blast from the past,L93123,u567,TROY,Yeah?
11346,m35,blast from the past,L93122,u547,ADAM,That would knock my father out.
11347,m35,blast from the past,L93121,u567,TROY,Okay maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
11348,m35,blast from the past,L93120,u547,ADAM,Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
11349,m35,blast from the past,L93119,u567,TROY,How do you get through those winters?  Well you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
11350,m35,blast from the past,L93118,u547,ADAM,No.
11351,m35,blast from the past,L93117,u567,TROY,You don't have a computer in your cabin?
11352,m35,blast from the past,L93116,u547,ADAM,I don't think so.
11353,m35,blast from the past,L93115,u567,TROY,What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
11354,m35,blast from the past,L93114,u547,ADAM,It's so small.
11355,m35,blast from the past,L93113,u567,TROY,Yeah.
11356,m35,blast from the past,L93112,u547,ADAM,This must be very new.
11357,m35,blast from the past,L93103,u547,ADAM,Sorry that's the largest city.
11358,m35,blast from the past,L93102,u567,TROY,Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
11359,m35,blast from the past,L93101,u547,ADAM,Juneau.
11360,m35,blast from the past,L93100,u567,TROY,What's the capitol?
11361,m35,blast from the past,L93099,u547,ADAM,1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then as well as now. I'm quoting my father of course.
11362,m35,blast from the past,L93098,u567,TROY,When did we get it from them?
11363,m35,blast from the past,L93097,u547,ADAM,Russia.
11364,m35,blast from the past,L93096,u567,TROY,Who use to own it?
11365,m35,blast from the past,L93095,u547,ADAM,1959.
11366,m35,blast from the past,L93094,u567,TROY,Well we try. Listen let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
11367,m35,blast from the past,L93091,u567,TROY,Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
11368,m35,blast from the past,L93090,u547,ADAM,I've got goose-bumps all over me.
11369,m35,blast from the past,L93088,u567,TROY,She's right?!
11370,m35,blast from the past,L93087,u547,ADAM,I've never met anyone like you in my life.
11371,m35,blast from the past,L93086,u567,TROY,That's right?
11372,m35,blast from the past,L93077,u567,TROY,Well Dionne Warwick guess his home town.
11373,m35,blast from the past,L93076,u547,ADAM,Right on the button.
11374,m35,blast from the past,L93072,u567,TROY,Really?  Since when?
11375,m35,blast from the past,L93071,u547,ADAM,Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
11376,m35,blast from the past,L93070,u567,TROY,And it's called...?
11377,m35,blast from the past,L93069,u547,ADAM,It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
11378,m35,blast from the past,L93061,u567,TROY,You nut!
11379,m35,blast from the past,L93060,u547,ADAM,I love Lucy!
11380,m35,blast from the past,L93058,u547,ADAM,Not particularly.
11381,m35,blast from the past,L93057,u567,TROY,I do? Well thank you! You like ceilings?
11382,m35,blast from the past,L93056,u547,ADAM,You have very nice ceilings.
11384,m35,blast from the past,L92903,u547,ADAM,Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
11386,m35,blast from the past,L92901,u547,ADAM,I guess living up here makes people look older.
11388,m35,blast from the past,L92899,u547,ADAM,How old do I look?
11390,m35,blast from the past,L92897,u547,ADAM,Thirty-five.
11392,m35,blast from the past,L92895,u547,ADAM,Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
11394,m35,blast from the past,L92893,u547,ADAM,My father is a genius.
11396,m35,blast from the past,L92891,u547,ADAM,I see.  Well thank you very much. You've been very very nice.
11398,m35,blast from the past,L92889,u547,ADAM,Of what?
11400,m35,blast from the past,L92729,u547,ADAM,Just look!!
11402,m35,blast from the past,L92727,u547,ADAM,Up there!!
11404,m35,blast from the past,L92725,u547,ADAM,The sky!!!
11407,m35,blast from the past,L92776,u547,ADAM,Well that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
11410,m35,blast from the past,L92773,u547,ADAM,Then I'll need twelve into nine hundred seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
11412,m35,blast from the past,L92771,u547,ADAM,Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
11413,m35,blast from the past,L92769,u547,ADAM,Yes please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
11415,m35,blast from the past,L92742,u547,ADAM,Good!
11417,m35,blast from the past,L92740,u547,ADAM,How do you do ma'am.
11419,m35,blast from the past,L92738,u547,ADAM,Oh my holy stars! A Negro!
11422,m35,blast from the past,L92808,u547,ADAM,I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
11424,m35,blast from the past,L92801,u547,ADAM,Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
11426,m35,blast from the past,L92788,u547,ADAM,Oh that would be wonderful!
11428,m35,blast from the past,L92786,u547,ADAM,See my problem is all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones fives tens. Like that.
11430,m35,blast from the past,L92784,u547,ADAM,I was thinking of selling all the cards.
11433,m35,blast from the past,L92780,u547,ADAM,Hello.
11434,m35,blast from the past,L93607,u547,ADAM,Yes.
11435,m35,blast from the past,L93606,u557,HELEN,No.
11436,m35,blast from the past,L93605,u547,ADAM,Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
11437,m35,blast from the past,L93604,u557,HELEN,Well where are you --
11438,m35,blast from the past,L93603,u547,ADAM,No Mom I've turned it into Dad's office.
11439,m35,blast from the past,L93602,u557,HELEN,This is your bedroom?
11440,m35,blast from the past,L93572,u557,HELEN,No wait! At least stay for dinner!
11441,m35,blast from the past,L93571,u547,ADAM,We have to go.
11442,m35,blast from the past,L93565,u547,ADAM,I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.
11443,m35,blast from the past,L93564,u557,HELEN,What?
11444,m35,blast from the past,L93563,u547,ADAM,Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
11445,m35,blast from the past,L93505,u557,HELEN,A psychiatrist?!
11446,m35,blast from the past,L93504,u547,ADAM,I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
11447,m35,blast from the past,L93503,u557,HELEN,Are you in trouble son?!
11448,m35,blast from the past,L93502,u547,ADAM,...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
11449,m35,blast from the past,L92700,u547,ADAM,Heck I know that mom! You're my parents.
11450,m35,blast from the past,L92699,u557,HELEN,Your father has a few final words for you. You know he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
11451,m35,blast from the past,L92698,u547,ADAM,Yes ma'am.
11452,m35,blast from the past,L92697,u557,HELEN,Here's the shopping list and $3000 which should take care of everything.
11453,m35,blast from the past,L92695,u547,ADAM,Yes ma'am.
11454,m35,blast from the past,L92694,u557,HELEN,Oh Adamthat would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls but in my day anyhow the girls from Pasadena I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
11455,m35,blast from the past,L92693,u547,ADAM,I was thinking that uh...you know while I was up there and all...that maybe I could you know...try to meet a girl.  I've been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
11456,m35,blast from the past,L92692,u557,HELEN,Yes?
11457,m35,blast from the past,L92691,u547,ADAM,Mom?
11458,m35,blast from the past,L92690,u557,HELEN,I just hope this is still good up there.
11459,m35,blast from the past,L92689,u547,ADAM,Right.
11460,m35,blast from the past,L92687,u547,ADAM,Yes ma'am.
11461,m35,blast from the past,L92686,u557,HELEN,I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies but if you can't get home by nightfall I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
11462,m35,blast from the past,L92683,u557,HELEN,You're my brave boy.
11463,m35,blast from the past,L92682,u547,ADAM,I'll be all right.
11464,m35,blast from the past,L92681,u557,HELEN,I'm afraid you've got to.
11465,m35,blast from the past,L92680,u547,ADAM,I'll go up.
11466,m35,blast from the past,L92679,u557,HELEN,He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
11467,m35,blast from the past,L92678,u557,HELEN,Oh no! Oh my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
11468,m35,blast from the past,L92677,u547,ADAM,Dad!
11469,m35,blast from the past,L92607,u557,HELEN,You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
11470,m35,blast from the past,L92606,u547,ADAM,Sorry Mom!
11471,m35,blast from the past,L92605,u557,HELEN,Elbows Son.
11472,m35,blast from the past,L92598,u547,ADAM,Yes ma'am.
11473,m35,blast from the past,L92597,u557,HELEN,Oh. A nice one I hope.
11475,m35,blast from the past,L93479,u556,EVE,I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
11477,m35,blast from the past,L93477,u556,EVE,You know I don't think so. I'm confused but you know I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
11479,m35,blast from the past,L93475,u556,EVE,No I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
11481,m35,blast from the past,L93473,u556,EVE,No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
11483,m35,blast from the past,L93471,u556,EVE,Oh my God!
11494,m35,blast from the past,L92652,u553,CALVIN,No I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
11496,m35,blast from the past,L92650,u553,CALVIN,Really?
11498,m35,blast from the past,L92646,u553,CALVIN,Yes yes the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
11499,m35,blast from the past,L92644,u553,CALVIN,So...you...survived the blast did you?
11501,m35,blast from the past,L92642,u553,CALVIN,What?!  A light!  Yes I've got a light!
11503,m35,blast from the past,L93562,u557,HELEN,What can I offer you Eve?
11504,m35,blast from the past,L93561,u553,CALVIN,Some time.
11505,m35,blast from the past,L93560,u557,HELEN,Well please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
11506,m35,blast from the past,L93554,u553,CALVIN,To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
11507,m35,blast from the past,L93553,u557,HELEN,Well that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering Calvin why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
11508,m35,blast from the past,L93552,u553,CALVIN,I thought ten years.
11509,m35,blast from the past,L93551,u557,HELEN,How long will you set it for this time?
11510,m35,blast from the past,L92906,u557,HELEN,Amen.
11511,m35,blast from the past,L92905,u553,CALVIN,And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son Adam.  Amen.
11512,m35,blast from the past,L92750,u557,HELEN,Yes dear I know.
11513,m35,blast from the past,L92749,u553,CALVIN,He's smart.
11514,m35,blast from the past,L92676,u553,CALVIN,--do as I say!
11515,m35,blast from the past,L92675,u557,HELEN,And the ocean!  A mountain range!
11516,m35,blast from the past,L92674,u553,CALVIN,--and we will--
11517,m35,blast from the past,L92673,u557,HELEN,I want him to at least see the sky!
11518,m35,blast from the past,L92672,u553,CALVIN,Well I am the head of this household--
11519,m35,blast from the past,L92671,u557,HELEN,No Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
11520,m35,blast from the past,L92670,u553,CALVIN,We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
11521,m35,blast from the past,L92669,u557,HELEN,For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
11522,m35,blast from the past,L92668,u557,HELEN,Excuse me.
11523,m35,blast from the past,L92667,u553,CALVIN,Yes.
11524,m35,blast from the past,L92666,u557,HELEN,We do?
11525,m35,blast from the past,L92665,u553,CALVIN,We stay down here.
11526,m35,blast from the past,L92664,u557,HELEN,Oh my. Ohmy oh my oh my. So what do we do now?
11527,m35,blast from the past,L92663,u553,CALVIN,They've done a lot of re-building but society at least as we knew it has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
11528,m35,blast from the past,L92661,u557,HELEN,I don't believe it!
11529,m35,blast from the past,L92660,u553,CALVIN,Yes.
11530,m35,blast from the past,L92659,u557,HELEN,No.
11531,m35,blast from the past,L92658,u553,CALVIN,Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
11532,m35,blast from the past,L92657,u553,CALVIN,It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears Son and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
11533,m35,blast from the past,L92656,u557,HELEN,Mutants?!
11534,m35,blast from the past,L92655,u553,CALVIN,I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
11535,m35,blast from the past,L92628,u557,HELEN,Yes! That's right!
11536,m35,blast from the past,L92626,u557,HELEN,Yes yes it is!
11537,m35,blast from the past,L92620,u557,HELEN,Just open the door.
11538,m35,blast from the past,L92619,u553,CALVIN,Should we say a little prayer first?
11539,m35,blast from the past,L92615,u553,CALVIN,I know exactly what you mean!  Hey honey?
11540,m35,blast from the past,L92614,u557,HELEN,Oh yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
11541,m35,blast from the past,L92613,u553,CALVIN,In the generator room again?
11542,m35,blast from the past,L92612,u553,CALVIN,Sure.
11543,m35,blast from the past,L92611,u557,HELEN,Would you excuse me?
11544,m35,blast from the past,L92610,u553,CALVIN,You know when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you hon?
11545,m35,blast from the past,L92609,u557,HELEN,Yes...
11546,m35,blast from the past,L92608,u553,CALVIN,If we still have one.
11547,m35,blast from the past,L92604,u553,CALVIN,Yeah. Let's dig in!
11548,m35,blast from the past,L92603,u557,HELEN,Let's eat our cake.
11549,m35,blast from the past,L92601,u553,CALVIN,Well we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
11550,m35,blast from the past,L92600,u557,HELEN,Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
11551,m35,blast from the past,L92599,u553,CALVIN,One who doesn't glow in the dark.
11552,m35,blast from the past,L92595,u553,CALVIN,Well we did in my family!
11553,m35,blast from the past,L92594,u557,HELEN,Oh that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
11554,m35,blast from the past,L92593,u553,CALVIN,If he tells it won't come true!
11555,m35,blast from the past,L92592,u557,HELEN,What did you wish for Adam?
11556,m35,blast from the past,L92588,u553,CALVIN,And I made these!
11557,m35,blast from the past,L92587,u557,HELEN,No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
11558,m35,blast from the past,L92580,u553,CALVIN,You bet.
11559,m35,blast from the past,L92579,u557,HELEN,Get the presents and do the lights.
11560,m35,blast from the past,L92578,u553,CALVIN,Coming!
11561,m35,blast from the past,L92577,u557,HELEN,Calvin!
11562,m35,blast from the past,L92555,u557,HELEN,Hi.
11563,m35,blast from the past,L92554,u553,CALVIN,Hi honey!
11564,m35,blast from the past,L92532,u553,CALVIN,I believe there will be other survivors. In fact I'm guessing there's life on the surface even now. It's not life worth living perhaps but believe me something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
11565,m35,blast from the past,L92531,u557,HELEN,Oh Calvin I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
11566,m35,blast from the past,L92530,u553,CALVIN,Yes you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
11567,m35,blast from the past,L92528,u553,CALVIN,Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
11568,m35,blast from the past,L92527,u557,HELEN,Yes he's very bright dear. Much like his father. But you know Calvin maybe he's a little...young for school.
11569,m35,blast from the past,L92526,u553,CALVIN,Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
11570,m35,blast from the past,L92509,u553,CALVIN,What?
11571,m35,blast from the past,L92508,u557,HELEN,Watch this!
11572,m35,blast from the past,L92507,u553,CALVIN,Yes.  Well... yes.
11573,m35,blast from the past,L92506,u557,HELEN,Very nice. Unless it caved in too.
11574,m35,blast from the past,L92505,u553,CALVIN,No reason.  Well it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So you know when the time is up we'll have to return to the surface using you know this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
11575,m35,blast from the past,L92504,u557,HELEN,Why?
11576,m35,blast from the past,L92503,u553,CALVIN,Oh I was just examining this rear hatchway.
11577,m35,blast from the past,L92502,u557,HELEN,We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
11578,m35,blast from the past,L92501,u553,CALVIN,Right here!
11579,m35,blast from the past,L92500,u557,HELEN,Calvin?!
11580,m35,blast from the past,L92489,u553,CALVIN,What? Whatever you want Helen!
11581,m35,blast from the past,L92488,u557,HELEN,If I...you know...
11582,m35,blast from the past,L92487,u553,CALVIN,Yes!
11583,m35,blast from the past,L92486,u557,HELEN,And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
11584,m35,blast from the past,L92485,u553,CALVIN,No.  I think it's just right.
11585,m35,blast from the past,L92484,u557,HELEN,What shall we call him?
11586,m35,blast from the past,L92483,u553,CALVIN,I've noticed.
11587,m35,blast from the past,L92482,u557,HELEN,No Calvin.  Babies cry.
11588,m35,blast from the past,L92481,u553,CALVIN,Is there a problem?
11589,m35,blast from the past,L92479,u553,CALVIN,Honey?
11590,m35,blast from the past,L92478,u557,HELEN,Uh oh. Now it's time.
11591,m35,blast from the past,L92477,u553,CALVIN,What?
11592,m35,blast from the past,L92476,u557,HELEN,Oh no.
11593,m35,blast from the past,L92475,u553,CALVIN,I told you! I've got everything!
11594,m35,blast from the past,L92474,u557,HELEN,You have tranquilizers?
11595,m35,blast from the past,L92473,u553,CALVIN,Would you like a tranquilizer?
11596,m35,blast from the past,L92472,u557,HELEN,No. No! Calvin this is different! Believe me!
11597,m35,blast from the past,L92471,u553,CALVIN,How could you?! This is just like home!
11598,m35,blast from the past,L92470,u557,HELEN,Maybe I've just got the creeps.
11599,m35,blast from the past,L92468,u553,CALVIN,Really?
11600,m35,blast from the past,L92467,u557,HELEN,No Calvin you're favorite.
11601,m35,blast from the past,L92466,u553,CALVIN,Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
11602,m35,blast from the past,L92465,u557,HELEN,I'm not hungry.
11603,m35,blast from the past,L92464,u553,CALVIN,Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
11604,m35,blast from the past,L92463,u557,HELEN,All our friends...
11605,m35,blast from the past,L92462,u553,CALVIN,We have to be strong sweetheart. If not for ourselves for the child.
11606,m35,blast from the past,L92461,u557,HELEN,No.
11607,m35,blast from the past,L92460,u553,CALVIN,Hi honey! Feeling better?
11608,m35,blast from the past,L92448,u557,HELEN,To go up.
11609,m35,blast from the past,L92447,u553,CALVIN,To go up.
11610,m35,blast from the past,L92446,u557,HELEN,It's safe.
11611,m35,blast from the past,L92445,u553,CALVIN,Then after that it's safe.
11612,m35,blast from the past,L92444,u557,HELEN,Thirty -five years!
11613,m35,blast from the past,L92443,u553,CALVIN,To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
11614,m35,blast from the past,L92442,u557,HELEN,The locks?
11615,m35,blast from the past,L92441,u553,CALVIN,The locks.
11616,m35,blast from the past,L92440,u557,HELEN,What's that noise?
11617,m35,blast from the past,L92434,u557,HELEN,To you maybe.
11618,m35,blast from the past,L92433,u553,CALVIN,Home sweet home!
11619,m35,blast from the past,L92432,u557,HELEN,As long as we've got that straight.
11620,m35,blast from the past,L92431,u553,CALVIN,Yes dear!
11621,m35,blast from the past,L92430,u557,HELEN,Now you listen to me Calvin Webber when this baby comes you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
11622,m35,blast from the past,L92429,u553,CALVIN,I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
11623,m35,blast from the past,L92428,u557,HELEN,But what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
11624,m35,blast from the past,L92427,u553,CALVIN,Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
11625,m35,blast from the past,L92426,u557,HELEN,Days??
11626,m35,blast from the past,L92425,u553,CALVIN,I don't know. For this thing to blow over it could take days.
11627,m35,blast from the past,L92424,u557,HELEN,How long will we have to stay down here?
11628,m35,blast from the past,L92419,u553,CALVIN,Yeah yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
11629,m35,blast from the past,L92418,u557,HELEN,Oh much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
11630,m35,blast from the past,L92417,u553,CALVIN,Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
11631,m35,blast from the past,L92416,u557,HELEN,Cheese is particularly troublesome.
11632,m35,blast from the past,L92415,u553,CALVIN,I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
11633,m35,blast from the past,L92414,u557,HELEN,Calvin I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
11634,m35,blast from the past,L92412,u557,HELEN,Yes.
11635,m35,blast from the past,L92411,u553,CALVIN,You hear that?!
11636,m35,blast from the past,L92408,u557,HELEN,I never know anymore.
11637,m35,blast from the past,L92407,u553,CALVIN,No.  They all do.
11638,m35,blast from the past,L92406,u557,HELEN,Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
11639,m35,blast from the past,L92405,u553,CALVIN,It shuts off automatically.
11640,m35,blast from the past,L92401,u557,HELEN,Time? Oh no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
11641,m35,blast from the past,L92400,u553,CALVIN,It's time.
11642,m35,blast from the past,L92398,u557,HELEN,We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
11643,m35,blast from the past,L92397,u553,CALVIN,I'm sorry everyone but given this extraordinary turn of events I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
11644,m35,blast from the past,L92357,u553,CALVIN,You bet hon!
11645,m35,blast from the past,L92356,u557,HELEN,Well put it down and come in!
11646,m35,blast from the past,L92355,u553,CALVIN,Sorry honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
11647,m35,blast from the past,L92354,u557,HELEN,For Pete's sake Calvin!  We've got guests!
11649,m35,blast from the past,L93335,u556,EVE,Stop it you two!
11651,m35,blast from the past,L93331,u556,EVE,Go home Adam.  Go to your hotel.
11653,m35,blast from the past,L93323,u556,EVE,So where is your roommate the model?
11655,m35,blast from the past,L93047,u556,EVE,Go home Cliff wherever that might be.
11656,m35,blast from the past,L93044,u556,EVE,This is Adam.  Adam meet Cliff.
11658,m35,blast from the past,L93042,u556,EVE,You came back for these?
11659,m35,blast from the past,L93041,u556,EVE,Your stuff?  Let me see that.
11661,m35,blast from the past,L93039,u556,EVE,What are you doing here?
11663,m35,blast from the past,L93549,u556,EVE,Stop!
11664,m35,blast from the past,L93548,u567,TROY,Where?!
11665,m35,blast from the past,L93547,u556,EVE,Adam!!
11666,m35,blast from the past,L93544,u567,TROY,Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
11667,m35,blast from the past,L93543,u556,EVE,Well we've come a long way haven't we?  I want to go home.
11668,m35,blast from the past,L93542,u567,TROY,None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
11669,m35,blast from the past,L93541,u556,EVE,Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
11670,m35,blast from the past,L93535,u556,EVE,Come on.
11671,m35,blast from the past,L93534,u567,TROY,An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
11672,m35,blast from the past,L93533,u556,EVE,What?!
11673,m35,blast from the past,L93532,u567,TROY,No. No wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
11674,m35,blast from the past,L93531,u556,EVE,You didn't stop anywhere else?!
11675,m35,blast from the past,L93530,u567,TROY,We came back to the house!
11676,m35,blast from the past,L93529,u556,EVE,Then what?
11677,m35,blast from the past,L93528,u567,TROY,To get some frozen poultry.
11678,m35,blast from the past,L93527,u556,EVE,Well at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
11679,m35,blast from the past,L93526,u567,TROY,I don't know. I like to think so.
11680,m35,blast from the past,L93524,u567,TROY,Yeah! That's thinking.
11681,m35,blast from the past,L93523,u556,EVE,Have him committed.
11682,m35,blast from the past,L93522,u567,TROY,Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest most polite honest trustworthy incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
11683,m35,blast from the past,L93519,u567,TROY,See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
11684,m35,blast from the past,L93518,u556,EVE,I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
11685,m35,blast from the past,L93517,u567,TROY,What's wrong?
11686,m35,blast from the past,L93515,u556,EVE,We'll find him.
11687,m35,blast from the past,L93514,u567,TROY,And if we can't find him?
11688,m35,blast from the past,L93513,u556,EVE,Give it back to him.
11689,m35,blast from the past,L93512,u567,TROY,What do you want to do with it?
11690,m35,blast from the past,L93498,u567,TROY,Fallout shelter.
11691,m35,blast from the past,L93497,u556,EVE,Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter do you?
11692,m35,blast from the past,L93490,u567,TROY,Oh.  Well you're...certainly welcome!
11693,m35,blast from the past,L93489,u556,EVE,Gay.
11694,m35,blast from the past,L93470,u567,TROY,What?!
11695,m35,blast from the past,L93469,u556,EVE,Oh no!
11696,m35,blast from the past,L93468,u567,TROY,I know...I know. You did the right thing.
11697,m35,blast from the past,L93467,u556,EVE,Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs don't you think?!
11698,m35,blast from the past,L93388,u556,EVE,Coward!
11699,m35,blast from the past,L93387,u567,TROY,I don't think so.
11700,m35,blast from the past,L93386,u556,EVE,You're goddamn right I am!
11701,m35,blast from the past,L93385,u567,TROY,What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
11702,m35,blast from the past,L93384,u556,EVE,Oh no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
11703,m35,blast from the past,L93383,u567,TROY,It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
11704,m35,blast from the past,L93382,u556,EVE,What?!!
11705,m35,blast from the past,L93381,u567,TROY,He left with Sophie.
11706,m35,blast from the past,L93380,u556,EVE,Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
11707,m35,blast from the past,L93379,u567,TROY,He didn't leave with them.
11708,m35,blast from the past,L93378,u556,EVE,So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
11709,m35,blast from the past,L93377,u567,TROY,From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
11710,m35,blast from the past,L93376,u556,EVE,Where did he get all that information?
11711,m35,blast from the past,L93375,u567,TROY,Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that nothing else matters. The cars the clothes the houses...
11712,m35,blast from the past,L93374,u556,EVE,Well consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
11713,m35,blast from the past,L93373,u567,TROY,He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
11714,m35,blast from the past,L93372,u556,EVE,What?
11715,m35,blast from the past,L93371,u567,TROY,You know I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See you'd eat like a slob if you were alone but since another human being is present you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
11716,m35,blast from the past,L93370,u556,EVE,Or have perfect table manners.
11717,m35,blast from the past,L93369,u567,TROY,Yes you do!
11718,m35,blast from the past,L93368,u556,EVE,Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
11719,m35,blast from the past,L93367,u567,TROY,Uh yes you do.
11720,m35,blast from the past,L93366,u556,EVE,And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
11721,m35,blast from the past,L93365,u567,TROY,Yes you do.
11722,m35,blast from the past,L93364,u556,EVE,In the first place I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
11723,m35,blast from the past,L93363,u556,EVE,What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
11724,m35,blast from the past,L93362,u567,TROY,Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
11725,m35,blast from the past,L93361,u556,EVE,To bed?
11726,m35,blast from the past,L93360,u567,TROY,To bed.
11727,m35,blast from the past,L93359,u556,EVE,Where are you going?
11728,m35,blast from the past,L93358,u567,TROY,Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
11729,m35,blast from the past,L93357,u556,EVE,Those sluts!
11730,m35,blast from the past,L93356,u567,TROY,Hey you're the psychic. Eve the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
11731,m35,blast from the past,L93355,u556,EVE,I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers didn't he?
11732,m35,blast from the past,L93354,u567,TROY,What's it to you?!
11733,m35,blast from the past,L93353,u556,EVE,Who did he leave with?
11734,m35,blast from the past,L93352,u567,TROY,We did not leave together.
11735,m35,blast from the past,L93351,u556,EVE,What's that mean?
11736,m35,blast from the past,L93350,u567,TROY,Uh..he might of.
11737,m35,blast from the past,L93349,u556,EVE,He go back to the hotel?
11738,m35,blast from the past,L93305,u567,TROY,Right here?  Well you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
11739,m35,blast from the past,L93304,u556,EVE,Go to the bathroom.
11740,m35,blast from the past,L93255,u556,EVE,It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
11741,m35,blast from the past,L93254,u567,TROY,Um... Eve?
11742,m35,blast from the past,L93249,u556,EVE,Well I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
11743,m35,blast from the past,L93248,u567,TROY,Eve?!
11744,m35,blast from the past,L93247,u556,EVE,Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
11745,m35,blast from the past,L93215,u556,EVE,For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
11746,m35,blast from the past,L93214,u567,TROY,Always good advice.
11747,m35,blast from the past,L93213,u556,EVE,Just be yourself.
11748,m35,blast from the past,L93181,u567,TROY,He's from Alaska.
11749,m35,blast from the past,L93180,u556,EVE,That water's freezing!
11750,m35,blast from the past,L93177,u556,EVE,No.
11751,m35,blast from the past,L93176,u567,TROY,How 'bout it Eve? Can he skate around your block?
11752,m35,blast from the past,L93174,u567,TROY,Let me show you the entire trousseau!
11753,m35,blast from the past,L93173,u556,EVE,I think...it...works.
11754,m35,blast from the past,L93172,u567,TROY,Well what do you think?
11755,m35,blast from the past,L93159,u567,TROY,What do you think Adam?
11756,m35,blast from the past,L93158,u556,EVE,I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
11757,m35,blast from the past,L93157,u567,TROY,Alright I will.
11758,m35,blast from the past,L93149,u567,TROY,That's what I'm sensing.
11759,m35,blast from the past,L93148,u556,EVE,Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
11760,m35,blast from the past,L93146,u556,EVE,And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing don't you?
11761,m35,blast from the past,L93145,u567,TROY,I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
11762,m35,blast from the past,L93144,u556,EVE,Well that's blunt!
11763,m35,blast from the past,L93143,u567,TROY,It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
11764,m35,blast from the past,L93142,u556,EVE,What's that supposed to mean?
11765,m35,blast from the past,L93141,u567,TROY,You're serious aren't you?
11766,m35,blast from the past,L93138,u556,EVE,Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
11767,m35,blast from the past,L93137,u567,TROY,I don't know.
11768,m35,blast from the past,L93134,u556,EVE,Exactly.  You understand that don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
11769,m35,blast from the past,L93133,u567,TROY,But first you have to start with the clothes!
11770,m35,blast from the past,L93079,u567,TROY,Oh my God...
11771,m35,blast from the past,L93078,u556,EVE,Give me your hand.
11772,m35,blast from the past,L93075,u556,EVE,I even guessed his hotel didn't I?
11773,m35,blast from the past,L93074,u567,TROY,Oh yes.
11774,m35,blast from the past,L93073,u556,EVE,Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
11775,m35,blast from the past,L93068,u556,EVE,Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
11776,m35,blast from the past,L93067,u567,TROY,So Adam...where on earth are you from?
11777,m35,blast from the past,L93055,u567,TROY,Darlin' this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.
11778,m35,blast from the past,L93054,u556,EVE,I knew you'd like him.
11779,m35,blast from the past,L93053,u567,TROY,Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
13884,m42,casablanca,L119167,u667,RICK,-- He's just a lucky guy.
13886,m42,casablanca,L119142,u667,RICK,Yes well everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
13888,m42,casablanca,L119140,u667,RICK,Go back to Bulgaria.
13890,m42,casablanca,L119138,u667,RICK,You want my advice?
13892,m42,casablanca,L119136,u667,RICK,Nobody ever loved me that much.
13893,m42,casablanca,L119134,u667,RICK,He always has.
13895,m42,casablanca,L119132,u667,RICK,And you want to know --
13897,m42,casablanca,L119130,u667,RICK,And he is still willing to give you a visa?
13899,m42,casablanca,L119128,u667,RICK,Does he know that?
13901,m42,casablanca,L119126,u667,RICK,Yes I'll bet.
13903,m42,casablanca,L119124,u667,RICK,So you decided to go to America.
13905,m42,casablanca,L119122,u667,RICK,How long have you been married?
13907,m42,casablanca,L119120,u667,RICK,I thought so. Where's your husband?
13909,m42,casablanca,L119118,u667,RICK,-- Now just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
13911,m42,casablanca,L119116,u667,RICK,Oh he's just like any other man only more so.
13914,m42,casablanca,L119113,u667,RICK,No of course not. Do you mind if I do?
13915,m42,casablanca,L119112,u667,RICK,He is? Well Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
13917,m42,casablanca,L119110,u667,RICK,I should have known.
13919,m42,casablanca,L119108,u667,RICK,How did you get in here? You're under age.
13921,m42,casablanca,L119106,u667,RICK,Yes?
13924,m42,casablanca,L118724,u665,LASZLO,I see.
13925,m42,casablanca,L118722,u665,LASZLO,As you see it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
13927,m42,casablanca,L118720,u665,LASZLO,In a concentration camp one is apt to lose a little weight.
13929,m42,casablanca,L118718,u665,LASZLO,A champagne cocktail please.
13931,m42,casablanca,L118716,u665,LASZLO,Mr. Berger the ring could I see it again?
13932,m42,casablanca,L118674,u665,LASZLO,I'm sorry. It is.
13935,m42,casablanca,L118669,u665,LASZLO,What is your name?
13938,m42,casablanca,L118665,u665,LASZLO,Thank you but I hardly think --
13940,m42,casablanca,L118663,u665,LASZLO,Well?
13943,m42,casablanca,L119328,u667,RICK,I want you to take Miss Lund home.
13945,m42,casablanca,L119326,u667,RICK,-- Tonight he forgot.
13947,m42,casablanca,L119324,u667,RICK,I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
13949,m42,casablanca,L119322,u667,RICK,Come up here a minute.
13952,m42,casablanca,L119268,u667,RICK,Goodnight.
13954,m42,casablanca,L119266,u667,RICK,-- Don't tell me where you're going.
13956,m42,casablanca,L119264,u667,RICK,Now you finish locking up will you Carl?
13958,m42,casablanca,L119262,u667,RICK,Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime everybody stays on salary.
13960,m42,casablanca,L119260,u667,RICK,How long can I afford to stay closed?
13963,m42,casablanca,L119169,u667,RICK,No thanks Carl.
13965,m42,casablanca,L118537,u667,RICK,That's all right.
13967,m42,casablanca,L118535,u667,RICK,Here you are.
13969,m42,casablanca,L118522,u667,RICK,-- Forget it Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
13971,m42,casablanca,L118520,u667,RICK,Well I'll get it from the safe.
13981,m42,casablanca,L119386,u667,RICK,Don't forget you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
13982,m42,casablanca,L119385,u667,RICK,Well so long.
13984,m42,casablanca,L119383,u667,RICK,And Abdul and Carl and Sacha they stay with the place or I don't sell.
13986,m42,casablanca,L119381,u667,RICK,Oh by the way my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
13988,m42,casablanca,L119379,u667,RICK,It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry it'll have to do.
13991,m42,casablanca,L118983,u667,RICK,That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
13992,m42,casablanca,L118982,u667,RICK,Well you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so too.
13994,m42,casablanca,L118980,u667,RICK,I'll tell him when he comes in.
13996,m42,casablanca,L118978,u667,RICK,And the carrying charges?
13998,m42,casablanca,L118976,u667,RICK,So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
14000,m42,casablanca,L118974,u667,RICK,Practically no one.
14002,m42,casablanca,L118972,u667,RICK,You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
14005,m42,casablanca,L118969,u667,RICK,I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over it's always just a little bit short.
14007,m42,casablanca,L118967,u667,RICK,I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
14009,m42,casablanca,L118472,u667,RICK,Suppose we do.
14011,m42,casablanca,L118470,u667,RICK,Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
14013,m42,casablanca,L118468,u667,RICK,I don't buy or sell human beings.
14015,m42,casablanca,L118466,u667,RICK,It's not for sale at any price.
14017,m42,casablanca,L118464,u667,RICK,It's not for sale.
14019,m42,casablanca,L118462,u667,RICK,Hello Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
14021,m42,casablanca,L119043,u665,LASZLO,Good day.
14023,m42,casablanca,L119040,u665,LASZLO,Thank you very much. Good day.
14025,m42,casablanca,L119038,u665,LASZLO,Rick?
14027,m42,casablanca,L119036,u665,LASZLO,Do you know where they are?
14029,m42,casablanca,L119034,u665,LASZLO,Yes something.
14032,m42,casablanca,L119030,u665,LASZLO,We've decided Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
14034,m42,casablanca,L119017,u665,LASZLO,I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
14035,m42,casablanca,L119014,u665,LASZLO,Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
14037,m42,casablanca,L119012,u665,LASZLO,You see my dear the word has gone around.
14038,m42,casablanca,L119229,u669,STRASSER,My dear Mademoiselle perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca human life is cheap. Good night Mademoiselle.
14039,m42,casablanca,L119228,u664,ILSA,And the other alternative?
14040,m42,casablanca,L119227,u669,STRASSER,It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
14041,m42,casablanca,L119226,u664,ILSA,What are they?
14042,m42,casablanca,L119225,u669,STRASSER,There are only two other alternatives for him.
14043,m42,casablanca,L119224,u664,ILSA,What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
14044,m42,casablanca,L119223,u669,STRASSER,Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
14045,m42,casablanca,L119222,u664,ILSA,Occupied France?
14046,m42,casablanca,L119221,u669,STRASSER,That is also true except for one destination to return to occupied France.
14047,m42,casablanca,L119220,u664,ILSA,This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
14048,m42,casablanca,L119219,u669,STRASSER,Mademoiselle after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
14049,m42,casablanca,L118929,u664,ILSA,You needn't be concerned about me.
14050,m42,casablanca,L118928,u669,STRASSER,And Mademoiselle?
14051,m42,casablanca,L119471,u667,RICK,She tried everything to get them and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me but that was all over long ago. For your sake she pretended it wasn't and I let her pretend.
14052,m42,casablanca,L119470,u664,ILSA,Yes.
14053,m42,casablanca,L119462,u667,RICK,And you never will. But I've got a job to do too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa I'm no good at being noble but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now now...
14054,m42,casablanca,L119461,u664,ILSA,And I said I would never leave you.
14055,m42,casablanca,L119460,u667,RICK,We'll always have Paris. We didn't have we'd lost it until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
14056,m42,casablanca,L119459,u664,ILSA,But what about us?
14057,m42,casablanca,L119458,u667,RICK,Maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life.
14058,m42,casablanca,L119457,u664,ILSA,No.
14059,m42,casablanca,L119456,u667,RICK,I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him you'll regret it.
14060,m42,casablanca,L119453,u667,RICK,-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true Louis?
14061,m42,casablanca,L119452,u664,ILSA,But Richard no I I --
14062,m42,casablanca,L119451,u667,RICK,-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
14063,m42,casablanca,L119450,u664,ILSA,No Richard no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
14064,m42,casablanca,L119449,u667,RICK,I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
14065,m42,casablanca,L119448,u664,ILSA,I don't understand. What about you?
14066,m42,casablanca,L119447,u667,RICK,Because you're getting on that plane.
14067,m42,casablanca,L119446,u664,ILSA,But why my name Richard?
14068,m42,casablanca,L119406,u664,ILSA,Oh Rick!
14069,m42,casablanca,L119405,u667,RICK,Everything is quite all right.
14070,m42,casablanca,L119404,u664,ILSA,But it's all right isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
14071,m42,casablanca,L119403,u667,RICK,No not yet.
14072,m42,casablanca,L119402,u664,ILSA,Richard Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
14073,m42,casablanca,L119313,u664,ILSA,I wish I didn't love you so much.
14074,m42,casablanca,L119312,u667,RICK,All right I will. Here's looking at you kid.
14075,m42,casablanca,L119311,u664,ILSA,I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us for all of us.
14076,m42,casablanca,L119310,u667,RICK,All except one. He won't have you.
14077,m42,casablanca,L119309,u664,ILSA,Oh you'll help him now Richard won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work all that he's been living for.
14078,m42,casablanca,L119308,u667,RICK,And Laszlo?
14079,m42,casablanca,L119307,u664,ILSA,Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
14080,m42,casablanca,L119306,u667,RICK,Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
14081,m42,casablanca,L119305,u664,ILSA,Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick he needed me. I wanted to tell you but I I didn't care. I knew I knew you wouldn't have left Paris and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well well you know the rest.
14082,m42,casablanca,L119304,u667,RICK,When did you first find out he was alive?
14083,m42,casablanca,L119303,u664,ILSA,Oh it wasn't my secret Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
14084,m42,casablanca,L119302,u667,RICK,Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
14085,m42,casablanca,L119300,u667,RICK,And then?
14086,m42,casablanca,L119296,u667,RICK,If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you you won't stop at anything. All right I'll make it easier for you.
14087,m42,casablanca,L119295,u664,ILSA,For the last time put them on the table.
14088,m42,casablanca,L119294,u667,RICK,No.
14089,m42,casablanca,L119293,u664,ILSA,Put them on the table.
14090,m42,casablanca,L119292,u667,RICK,I don't have to. I've got them right here.
14091,m42,casablanca,L119291,u664,ILSA,-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
14092,m42,casablanca,L119289,u667,RICK,What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
14093,m42,casablanca,L119288,u664,ILSA,No. Oh Richard I'm sorry. I'm sorry but but you you are our last hope. If you don't help us Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
14094,m42,casablanca,L119286,u667,RICK,-- I wouldn't believe you no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
14095,m42,casablanca,L119285,u664,ILSA,Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened if you only knew the truth --
14096,m42,casablanca,L119284,u667,RICK,-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
14097,m42,casablanca,L119283,u664,ILSA,Richard Richard we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
14098,m42,casablanca,L119282,u667,RICK,I'm not fighting for anything anymore except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
14099,m42,casablanca,L119281,u664,ILSA,It was your cause too. In your own way you were fighting for the same thing.
14100,m42,casablanca,L119280,u667,RICK,Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
14101,m42,casablanca,L119279,u664,ILSA,I know how you feel about me but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
14102,m42,casablanca,L119278,u667,RICK,I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
14103,m42,casablanca,L119277,u664,ILSA,You can ask any price you want but you must give me those letters.
14104,m42,casablanca,L119276,u667,RICK,Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
14105,m42,casablanca,L119275,u664,ILSA,Please.
14106,m42,casablanca,L119273,u664,ILSA,Richard I had to see you.
14107,m42,casablanca,L119272,u667,RICK,I told you this morning you'd come around but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well won't you sit down?
14108,m42,casablanca,L119271,u664,ILSA,The stairs from the street.
14109,m42,casablanca,L119270,u667,RICK,How did you get in?
14110,m42,casablanca,L119009,u664,ILSA,No Rick. No you see Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was even when I knew you in Paris.
14111,m42,casablanca,L119008,u667,RICK,All the same someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
14112,m42,casablanca,L119007,u667,RICK,Well I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now above a saloon it's true but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
14113,m42,casablanca,L119006,u664,ILSA,You can believe that if you want to.
14114,m42,casablanca,L119005,u667,RICK,Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like hiding from the police running away all the time?
14115,m42,casablanca,L119004,u664,ILSA,Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca not last night.
14116,m42,casablanca,L119003,u667,RICK,Why not? After all I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
14117,m42,casablanca,L119002,u664,ILSA,I don't think I will Rick.
14118,m42,casablanca,L119001,u667,RICK,Well you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
14119,m42,casablanca,L119000,u664,ILSA,Yes.
14120,m42,casablanca,L118999,u667,RICK,Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
14121,m42,casablanca,L118993,u664,ILSA,It doesn't matter.
14122,m42,casablanca,L118992,u667,RICK,I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
14123,m42,casablanca,L118898,u664,ILSA,I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me Rick it's true. I didn't know.
14124,m42,casablanca,L118897,u667,RICK,Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
14125,m42,casablanca,L118896,u664,ILSA,Please.
14126,m42,casablanca,L118895,u667,RICK,Especially tonight.
14127,m42,casablanca,L118894,u664,ILSA,No. No Rick. Not tonight.
14128,m42,casablanca,L118893,u667,RICK,Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
14129,m42,casablanca,L118887,u664,ILSA,I love you so much and I hate this war so much. Oh it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away I mean if if something should keep us apart wherever they put you and wherever I'll be I want you to know...
14130,m42,casablanca,L118886,u667,RICK,Well why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey hey what's wrong kid?
14131,m42,casablanca,L118885,u664,ILSA,Oh darling!
14132,m42,casablanca,L118884,u667,RICK,Yes I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
14133,m42,casablanca,L118883,u664,ILSA,That's too far ahead to plan.
14134,m42,casablanca,L118882,u667,RICK,All right. At a quarter to five.  Say why don't we get married in Marseilles?
14135,m42,casablanca,L118881,u664,ILSA,No no. Not at my hotel. I uh I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station huh?
14136,m42,casablanca,L118880,u667,RICK,-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
14137,m42,casablanca,L118879,u664,ILSA,Yes of course we --
14138,m42,casablanca,L118878,u667,RICK,No no no no. We must leave.
14139,m42,casablanca,L118877,u664,ILSA,But be serious darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
14140,m42,casablanca,L118876,u667,RICK,I know very little about you just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
14141,m42,casablanca,L118875,u664,ILSA,Strange. I know so very little about you.
14142,m42,casablanca,L118871,u667,RICK,Ah that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound only about thirty-five miles away.
14143,m42,casablanca,L118870,u664,ILSA,Was that cannon fire or is it my heart pounding?
14144,m42,casablanca,L118869,u667,RICK,Looking for a job.
14145,m42,casablanca,L118868,u664,ILSA,Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
14146,m42,casablanca,L118867,u667,RICK,Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you say ten years ago?
14147,m42,casablanca,L118866,u664,ILSA,With the whole world crumbling we pick this time to fall in love.
14148,m42,casablanca,L118865,u664,ILSA,It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
14149,m42,casablanca,L118864,u667,RICK,My German's a little rusty.
14150,m42,casablanca,L118860,u667,RICK,I'm on their blacklist already their roll of honor.
14151,m42,casablanca,L118859,u664,ILSA,Richard they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
14152,m42,casablanca,L118857,u664,ILSA,Well only one answer can take care of all our questions.
14153,m42,casablanca,L118855,u664,ILSA,That's easy. There was. He's dead.
14154,m42,casablanca,L118854,u667,RICK,Uh huh.
14155,m42,casablanca,L118853,u664,ILSA,Why there is no other man in my life?
14156,m42,casablanca,L118852,u667,RICK,Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
14157,m42,casablanca,L118851,u664,ILSA,Yes?
14158,m42,casablanca,L118850,u667,RICK,And I was wondering.
14159,m42,casablanca,L118849,u664,ILSA,I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
14160,m42,casablanca,L118848,u667,RICK,In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
14161,m42,casablanca,L118847,u664,ILSA,A franc for your thoughts.
14162,m42,casablanca,L118846,u667,RICK,Here's looking at you kid.
14163,m42,casablanca,L118844,u667,RICK,Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
14164,m42,casablanca,L118799,u667,RICK,He hasn't played it in a long time.
14165,m42,casablanca,L118797,u667,RICK,I will.
14166,m42,casablanca,L118796,u664,ILSA,Say goodnight to Sam for me.
14167,m42,casablanca,L118785,u664,ILSA,Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out I'll wear it again.
14168,m42,casablanca,L118784,u667,RICK,I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray you wore blue.
14169,m42,casablanca,L118783,u664,ILSA,No.
14170,m42,casablanca,L118782,u667,RICK,Not an easy day to forget.
14171,m42,casablanca,L118781,u664,ILSA,How nice. You remembered. But of course that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
14174,m42,casablanca,L118749,u664,ILSA,Play it once Sam for old time's sake.
14176,m42,casablanca,L118747,u664,ILSA,You used to be a much better liar Sam.
14178,m42,casablanca,L118745,u664,ILSA,Does he always leave so early?
14180,m42,casablanca,L118743,u664,ILSA,When will he be back?
14182,m42,casablanca,L118741,u664,ILSA,Where is Rick?
14184,m42,casablanca,L118739,u664,ILSA,Some of the old songs Sam.
14186,m42,casablanca,L118737,u664,ILSA,It's been a long time.
14188,m42,casablanca,L118735,u664,ILSA,Hello Sam.
14189,m42,casablanca,L119477,u664,ILSA,Yes I'm ready.  Goodbye Rick. God bless you.
14190,m42,casablanca,L119476,u665,LASZLO,Are you ready Ilsa?
14191,m42,casablanca,L119258,u665,LASZLO,Of course I'll be careful.
14192,m42,casablanca,L119257,u664,ILSA,Be careful.
14193,m42,casablanca,L119254,u665,LASZLO,-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight dear.
14194,m42,casablanca,L119253,u664,ILSA,Yes Yes I know. Victor whatever I do will you believe that I that --
14195,m42,casablanca,L119252,u665,LASZLO,I love you very much my dear.
14196,m42,casablanca,L119251,u664,ILSA,No Victor there isn't.
14197,m42,casablanca,L119250,u665,LASZLO,I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
14198,m42,casablanca,L119249,u664,ILSA,Yes Victor I was.
14199,m42,casablanca,L119248,u665,LASZLO,When I was in the concentration camp were you lonely in Paris?
14200,m42,casablanca,L119247,u664,ILSA,-- Yes?
14201,m42,casablanca,L119246,u665,LASZLO,Ilsa I --
14202,m42,casablanca,L119243,u664,ILSA,Ask me?
14203,m42,casablanca,L119242,u665,LASZLO,He suggested I ask you.
14204,m42,casablanca,L119241,u664,ILSA,Did he give any reason?
14205,m42,casablanca,L119240,u665,LASZLO,But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him money would.
14206,m42,casablanca,L119239,u664,ILSA,Yes?
14207,m42,casablanca,L119238,u665,LASZLO,Apparently he has the letters.
14208,m42,casablanca,L119237,u664,ILSA,Whatever I'd say you'd carry on. Victor why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
14209,m42,casablanca,L119236,u665,LASZLO,To tell you the truth I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding or shall I carry on the best I can?
14210,m42,casablanca,L119235,u664,ILSA,Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight I am frightened.
14211,m42,casablanca,L119234,u665,LASZLO,I must. Besides it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
14212,m42,casablanca,L119233,u664,ILSA,Victor please don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
14213,m42,casablanca,L119232,u665,LASZLO,Our faithful friend is still there.
14214,m42,casablanca,L119231,u665,LASZLO,We'll discuss it later.
14215,m42,casablanca,L119230,u664,ILSA,What happened with Rick?
14216,m42,casablanca,L119148,u665,LASZLO,And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
14217,m42,casablanca,L119147,u664,ILSA,He does. Could we have a table close to him?
14218,m42,casablanca,L119027,u665,LASZLO,I meant to but something always held me up. I love you very much Ilsa.
14219,m42,casablanca,L119026,u664,ILSA,Yes I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time why didn't you leave me then?
14220,m42,casablanca,L119025,u665,LASZLO,Yes I would.
14221,m42,casablanca,L119024,u664,ILSA,But Victor if the situation were different if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one would you take it?
14222,m42,casablanca,L119023,u665,LASZLO,No Ilsa I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me somehow I will get out and join you.
14223,m42,casablanca,L119021,u664,ILSA,No Victor no.
14224,m42,casablanca,L119020,u665,LASZLO,Please Ilsa don't be hasty.
14225,m42,casablanca,L119019,u664,ILSA,We are only interested in two visas Signor.
14226,m42,casablanca,L118809,u665,LASZLO,Goodnight.
14227,m42,casablanca,L118808,u664,ILSA,Goodnight.
14228,m42,casablanca,L118801,u665,LASZLO,Goodnight.
14229,m42,casablanca,L118800,u664,ILSA,Goodnight.
14230,m42,casablanca,L118715,u665,LASZLO,I will don't worry.
14231,m42,casablanca,L118714,u664,ILSA,Be careful.
14232,m42,casablanca,L118713,u665,LASZLO,I must find out what Berger knows.
14233,m42,casablanca,L118712,u665,LASZLO,We have been in difficult places before haven't we?
14234,m42,casablanca,L118711,u664,ILSA,Victor I'm afraid for you.
14235,m42,casablanca,L118710,u665,LASZLO,This time they really mean to stop me.
14236,m42,casablanca,L118683,u665,LASZLO,Won't you join us?
14237,m42,casablanca,L118682,u664,ILSA,You are very kind.
14238,m42,casablanca,L118661,u665,LASZLO,If we would walk out so soon it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
14239,m42,casablanca,L118660,u664,ILSA,Victor I I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
14240,m42,casablanca,L119455,u664,ILSA,You're saying this only to make me go.
14241,m42,casablanca,L119454,u666,RENAULT,I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
14242,m42,casablanca,L118779,u664,ILSA,I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see the last time we met --
14243,m42,casablanca,L118778,u666,RENAULT,I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier Rick in a way that made me extremely jealous.
14244,m42,casablanca,L118763,u664,ILSA,-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
14245,m42,casablanca,L118762,u666,RENAULT,Well then perhaps you also ---
14246,m42,casablanca,L118761,u666,RENAULT,Oh you've already met Rick Mademoiselle?
14247,m42,casablanca,L118760,u664,ILSA,Hello Rick.
14248,m42,casablanca,L118695,u666,RENAULT,Well Mademoiselle he's the kind of a man that well if I were a woman and I...  were not around I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
14249,m42,casablanca,L118694,u664,ILSA,-- Is what?
14250,m42,casablanca,L118693,u666,RENAULT,Mademoiselle you are in Rick's and Rick is --
14251,m42,casablanca,L118692,u664,ILSA,Rick? Who's he?
14252,m42,casablanca,L118691,u666,RENAULT,He came from Paris with Rick.
14253,m42,casablanca,L118690,u664,ILSA,Yes.
14254,m42,casablanca,L118689,u666,RENAULT,Sam?
14255,m42,casablanca,L118688,u664,ILSA,Captain the boy who is playing the piano somewhere I have seen him.
14256,m42,casablanca,L119473,u667,RICK,Here it is.
14257,m42,casablanca,L119472,u665,LASZLO,I understand.
14258,m42,casablanca,L119469,u667,RICK,But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true Ilsa?
14259,m42,casablanca,L119468,u665,LASZLO,Yes.
14260,m42,casablanca,L119467,u667,RICK,I'm going to anyway because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
14261,m42,casablanca,L119466,u665,LASZLO,Monsieur Blaine I don't ask you to explain anything.
14262,m42,casablanca,L119465,u667,RICK,All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
14263,m42,casablanca,L119464,u665,LASZLO,Everything in order?
14264,m42,casablanca,L119416,u667,RICK,Good. I've got the letters right here all made out in blank.
14265,m42,casablanca,L119415,u665,LASZLO,No. It's all arranged.
14266,m42,casablanca,L119414,u667,RICK,Oh never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon will you?
14267,m42,casablanca,L119413,u665,LASZLO,But we made a deal.
14268,m42,casablanca,L119412,u667,RICK,Keep it. You'll need it in America.
14269,m42,casablanca,L119411,u665,LASZLO,I brought the money Monsieur Blaine.
14270,m42,casablanca,L119410,u667,RICK,Oh save it. We've still lots of things to do.
14271,m42,casablanca,L119409,u665,LASZLO,Monsieur Blaine I don't know how to thank you.
14272,m42,casablanca,L119344,u665,LASZLO,Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well I am also a human being.
14273,m42,casablanca,L119343,u667,RICK,You love her that much?
14274,m42,casablanca,L119342,u665,LASZLO,I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know for instance that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame I I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
14275,m42,casablanca,L119341,u667,RICK,You seem to know all about my destiny.
14276,m42,casablanca,L119340,u665,LASZLO,I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
14277,m42,casablanca,L119339,u667,RICK,Yes I get the point.
14278,m42,casablanca,L119338,u665,LASZLO,You know how you sound Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny for good or for evil.
14279,m42,casablanca,L119337,u667,RICK,What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
14280,m42,casablanca,L119336,u665,LASZLO,We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies the world will die.
14281,m42,casablanca,L119335,u667,RICK,Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
14282,m42,casablanca,L119334,u665,LASZLO,Yes rather.
14283,m42,casablanca,L119333,u667,RICK,Had a close one eh?
14284,m42,casablanca,L119332,u665,LASZLO,Thank you.
14285,m42,casablanca,L119331,u667,RICK,Well this might come in handy.
14286,m42,casablanca,L119203,u665,LASZLO,My wife?
14287,m42,casablanca,L119202,u667,RICK,I said ask your wife.
14288,m42,casablanca,L119201,u665,LASZLO,I beg your pardon?
14289,m42,casablanca,L119200,u667,RICK,There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
14290,m42,casablanca,L119199,u665,LASZLO,There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
14291,m42,casablanca,L119198,u667,RICK,My friend you could make it a million francs or three my answer would still be the same.
14292,m42,casablanca,L119197,u665,LASZLO,I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
14293,m42,casablanca,L119196,u667,RICK,I appreciate it but I don't accept it.
14294,m42,casablanca,L119195,u665,LASZLO,Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
14295,m42,casablanca,L119194,u667,RICK,Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
14296,m42,casablanca,L119193,u665,LASZLO,Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
14297,m42,casablanca,L119192,u667,RICK,What of it?
14298,m42,casablanca,L119191,u665,LASZLO,My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
14299,m42,casablanca,L119190,u667,RICK,I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
14300,m42,casablanca,L119189,u665,LASZLO,You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
14301,m42,casablanca,L119188,u665,LASZLO,Right.
14302,m42,casablanca,L119187,u667,RICK,My office.
14303,m42,casablanca,L119186,u665,LASZLO,Well isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential what I have to say.
14304,m42,casablanca,L119185,u667,RICK,Go ahead.
14305,m42,casablanca,L119184,u665,LASZLO,Monsieur Blaine I wonder if I could talk to you?
14306,m42,casablanca,L119146,u667,RICK,I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of well happier days.
14307,m42,casablanca,L119145,u665,LASZLO,Good evening. You see here we are again.
14308,m42,casablanca,L119144,u667,RICK,Good evening.
14309,m42,casablanca,L118987,u667,RICK,Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
14310,m42,casablanca,L118986,u665,LASZLO,Good morning.
14311,m42,casablanca,L118795,u667,RICK,Any time.
14312,m42,casablanca,L118794,u665,LASZLO,We'll come again.
14313,m42,casablanca,L118790,u667,RICK,Not at all.
14314,m42,casablanca,L118789,u665,LASZLO,I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
14315,m42,casablanca,L118777,u667,RICK,We all try. You succeed.
14316,m42,casablanca,L118776,u665,LASZLO,Thank you. I try.
14317,m42,casablanca,L118775,u667,RICK,Your work.
14318,m42,casablanca,L118774,u665,LASZLO,What for?
14319,m42,casablanca,L118773,u667,RICK,And I congratulate you.
14320,m42,casablanca,L118768,u665,LASZLO,Won't you join us for a drink?
14321,m42,casablanca,L118767,u667,RICK,And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
14322,m42,casablanca,L118766,u665,LASZLO,One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
14323,m42,casablanca,L118765,u667,RICK,How do you do?
14324,m42,casablanca,L118764,u665,LASZLO,How do you do?
14325,m42,casablanca,L118952,u665,LASZLO,Are you quite finished with us?
14326,m42,casablanca,L118951,u666,RENAULT,I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
14327,m42,casablanca,L118948,u665,LASZLO,Nothing important but may I speak to him now?
14328,m42,casablanca,L118947,u666,RENAULT,I believe you have a message for him?
14329,m42,casablanca,L118946,u665,LASZLO,Yes.
14330,m42,casablanca,L118945,u666,RENAULT,By the way Monsieur last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
14331,m42,casablanca,L118944,u665,LASZLO,-- Thank you.
14332,m42,casablanca,L118943,u666,RENAULT,Monsieur insofar as it is in my power --
14333,m42,casablanca,L118937,u665,LASZLO,I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
14334,m42,casablanca,L118936,u666,RENAULT,And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
14335,m42,casablanca,L118927,u665,LASZLO,Well perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
14336,m42,casablanca,L118926,u666,RENAULT,I am afraid not. My regrets Monsieur.
14337,m42,casablanca,L118922,u665,LASZLO,Thank you.
14338,m42,casablanca,L118921,u666,RENAULT,With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
14339,m42,casablanca,L118920,u665,LASZLO,May we proceed with the business?
14340,m42,casablanca,L118919,u666,RENAULT,That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
14341,m42,casablanca,L118918,u665,LASZLO,I slept very well.
14342,m42,casablanca,L118917,u666,RENAULT,I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
14343,m42,casablanca,L118807,u666,RENAULT,Goodnight.
14344,m42,casablanca,L118806,u665,LASZLO,We'll be there.
14345,m42,casablanca,L118805,u666,RENAULT,Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
14346,m42,casablanca,L118788,u666,RENAULT,So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
14347,m42,casablanca,L118787,u665,LASZLO,Ilsa I don't wish to be the one to say it but it's late.
14348,m42,casablanca,L118786,u666,RENAULT,Ricky you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that Mademoiselle.
14349,m42,casablanca,L118772,u665,LASZLO,This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
14350,m42,casablanca,L118771,u666,RENAULT,Well! A precedent is being broken. Er Emil!
14351,m42,casablanca,L118733,u666,RENAULT,No. Two champagne cocktails please.
14352,m42,casablanca,L118732,u665,LASZLO,My bill.
14353,m42,casablanca,L118706,u665,LASZLO,Very well.
14354,m42,casablanca,L118705,u666,RENAULT,Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
14355,m42,casablanca,L118687,u666,RENAULT,No. Please Monsieur it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
14356,m42,casablanca,L118686,u665,LASZLO,No Captain please.
14357,m42,casablanca,L118681,u666,RENAULT,I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
14358,m42,casablanca,L118680,u665,LASZLO,Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me Captain but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
14359,m42,casablanca,L118679,u666,RENAULT,Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
14360,m42,casablanca,L118678,u665,LASZLO,Yes. What is it you want?
14361,m42,casablanca,L118677,u666,RENAULT,I am Captain Renault Prefect of Police.
14362,m42,casablanca,L118676,u665,LASZLO,Yes.
14363,m42,casablanca,L118675,u666,RENAULT,Monsieur Laszlo is it not?
14364,m42,casablanca,L118954,u665,LASZLO,Good day.
14365,m42,casablanca,L118953,u669,STRASSER,For the time being.
14366,m42,casablanca,L118942,u665,LASZLO,You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
14367,m42,casablanca,L118941,u669,STRASSER,Herr Laszlo you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
14368,m42,casablanca,L118940,u665,LASZLO,And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe hundreds thousands would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
14369,m42,casablanca,L118938,u669,STRASSER,You will give us the names?
14370,m42,casablanca,L118935,u669,STRASSER,Yes even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts you will have your visa in the morning.
14371,m42,casablanca,L118934,u665,LASZLO,Even in Berlin.
14372,m42,casablanca,L118933,u669,STRASSER,You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris in Prague in Brussels in Amsterdam in Oslo in Belgrade in Athens.
14373,m42,casablanca,L118932,u665,LASZLO,And that is?
14374,m42,casablanca,L118931,u669,STRASSER,Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow on one condition.
14375,m42,casablanca,L118930,u665,LASZLO,Is that all you wish to tell us?
14376,m42,casablanca,L118925,u669,STRASSER,Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.  Captain would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?
14377,m42,casablanca,L118924,u665,LASZLO,Whether or not you succeed is of course problematical.
14378,m42,casablanca,L118923,u669,STRASSER,Very well Herr Laszlo we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
14379,m42,casablanca,L118704,u665,LASZLO,Captain Renault I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
14380,m42,casablanca,L118703,u669,STRASSER,Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office with Mademoiselle.
14381,m42,casablanca,L118702,u665,LASZLO,This is hardly the time or the place.
14382,m42,casablanca,L118701,u669,STRASSER,I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
14383,m42,casablanca,L118700,u665,LASZLO,I've never accepted that privilege and I'm now on French soil.
14384,m42,casablanca,L118699,u669,STRASSER,You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
14385,m42,casablanca,L118698,u665,LASZLO,I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious but you see Major Strasser I'm a Czechoslovakian.
14386,m42,casablanca,L119488,u666,RENAULT,Ask Monsieur Rick.
14387,m42,casablanca,L119487,u669,STRASSER,Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
14388,m42,casablanca,L119486,u666,RENAULT,Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
14389,m42,casablanca,L119485,u669,STRASSER,What is the meaning of that phone call?
14390,m42,casablanca,L119212,u669,STRASSER,Find one.
14391,m42,casablanca,L119211,u666,RENAULT,But I have no excuse to close it.
14392,m42,casablanca,L119210,u669,STRASSER,Yes much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
14393,m42,casablanca,L119209,u666,RENAULT,But everybody's having such a good time.
14394,m42,casablanca,L119208,u669,STRASSER,You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
14395,m42,casablanca,L119086,u666,RENAULT,I see what you mean.
14396,m42,casablanca,L119085,u669,STRASSER,Uh huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
14397,m42,casablanca,L119084,u666,RENAULT,A leader like Laszlo?
14398,m42,casablanca,L119083,u669,STRASSER,We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance waiting perhaps for a leader.
14399,m42,casablanca,L119081,u669,STRASSER,And if it should change?
14400,m42,casablanca,L119080,u666,RENAULT,I have no conviction if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
14401,m42,casablanca,L119079,u669,STRASSER,Captain Renault are you entirely certain which side you're on?
14402,m42,casablanca,L119078,u666,RENAULT,My dear Major we are trying to cooperate with your government but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
14403,m42,casablanca,L119077,u669,STRASSER,You see Captain the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
14404,m42,casablanca,L118915,u666,RENAULT,It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
14405,m42,casablanca,L118914,u669,STRASSER,As to Laszlo we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
14406,m42,casablanca,L118912,u669,STRASSER,You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
14407,m42,casablanca,L118911,u666,RENAULT,If Rick has the letters he's much too smart to let you find them there.
14408,m42,casablanca,L118910,u669,STRASSER,I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
14409,m42,casablanca,L118708,u669,STRASSER,Mademoiselle.
14410,m42,casablanca,L118707,u666,RENAULT,Mademoiselle.
14411,m42,casablanca,L118653,u669,STRASSER,Perhaps.
14412,m42,casablanca,L118652,u666,RENAULT,You see Major you have nothing to worry about Rick.
14413,m42,casablanca,L118649,u669,STRASSER,I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
14414,m42,casablanca,L118648,u666,RENAULT,Of course one must admit he has great courage.
14415,m42,casablanca,L118638,u669,STRASSER,You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
14416,m42,casablanca,L118637,u666,RENAULT,Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women too.
14417,m42,casablanca,L118633,u669,STRASSER,How about New York?
14418,m42,casablanca,L118632,u666,RENAULT,Ho diplomatist!
14419,m42,casablanca,L118620,u669,STRASSER,Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially of course.
14420,m42,casablanca,L118619,u666,RENAULT,Well personally Major I will take what comes.
14421,m42,casablanca,L118613,u669,STRASSER,How do you do Mr. Rick?
14422,m42,casablanca,L118612,u666,RENAULT,Rick this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
14423,m42,casablanca,L118594,u669,STRASSER,I expected no less Captain.
14424,m42,casablanca,L118593,u666,RENAULT,Especially so tonight Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
14425,m42,casablanca,L118590,u669,STRASSER,Thank you.
14426,m42,casablanca,L118589,u666,RENAULT,May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26 a good French wine.
14427,m42,casablanca,L118588,u669,STRASSER,Champagne and a tin of caviar.
14428,m42,casablanca,L118587,u666,RENAULT,Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here Major.
14429,m42,casablanca,L118585,u669,STRASSER,Good evening Captain.
14430,m42,casablanca,L118584,u666,RENAULT,Good evening gentlemen.
14431,m42,casablanca,L118397,u669,STRASSER,I have already heard about this cafe and also about Mr. Rick himself.
14432,m42,casablanca,L118396,u666,RENAULT,Oh there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
14433,m42,casablanca,L118393,u666,RENAULT,Realizing the importance of the case my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
14434,m42,casablanca,L118392,u669,STRASSER,By the way the murder of the couriers what has been done?
14435,m42,casablanca,L118391,u666,RENAULT,What else my dear Major?
14436,m42,casablanca,L118390,u669,STRASSER,Oh we Germans must get used to all climates from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
14437,m42,casablanca,L118389,u666,RENAULT,You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm Major.
14438,m42,casablanca,L118386,u666,RENAULT,Major Strasser my aide Lieutenant Casselle.
14439,m42,casablanca,L118385,u669,STRASSER,Thank you Captain. It's very good to be here.
14440,m42,casablanca,L118384,u666,RENAULT,Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
14441,m42,casablanca,L119508,u667,RICK,Louis I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
14442,m42,casablanca,L119507,u666,RENAULT,Uh huh.
14443,m42,casablanca,L119506,u667,RICK,Our expenses?
14444,m42,casablanca,L119505,u666,RENAULT,And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
14445,m42,casablanca,L119504,u667,RICK,My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
14446,m42,casablanca,L119503,u666,RENAULT,It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
14447,m42,casablanca,L119502,u666,RENAULT,I think perhaps you're right.
14448,m42,casablanca,L119501,u667,RICK,Maybe but it seemed like a good time to start.
14449,m42,casablanca,L119500,u666,RENAULT,Well Rick you're not only a sentimentalist but you've become a patriot.
14450,m42,casablanca,L119484,u667,RICK,As soon as the plane goes Louis.
14451,m42,casablanca,L119483,u666,RENAULT,I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
14452,m42,casablanca,L119482,u667,RICK,Anyway thanks for helping me out.
14453,m42,casablanca,L119481,u666,RENAULT,What you just did for Laszlo and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women my friend. She went but she knew you were lying.
14454,m42,casablanca,L119480,u667,RICK,Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
14455,m42,casablanca,L119479,u666,RENAULT,Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
14456,m42,casablanca,L119445,u667,RICK,And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
14457,m42,casablanca,L119444,u666,RENAULT,You think of everything don't you?
14458,m42,casablanca,L119443,u667,RICK,If you don't mind you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
14459,m42,casablanca,L119433,u666,RENAULT,That is my least vulnerable spot.
14460,m42,casablanca,L119432,u667,RICK,Just the same you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember this gun's pointed right at your heart.
14461,m42,casablanca,L119431,u666,RENAULT,Call off your watch-dogs you said.
14462,m42,casablanca,L119430,u667,RICK,I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
14463,m42,casablanca,L119429,u666,RENAULT,I suppose you know what you're doing but I wonder if you realize what this means?
14464,m42,casablanca,L119425,u666,RENAULT,Put that gun down.
14465,m42,casablanca,L119424,u667,RICK,I have. Sit down over there.
14466,m42,casablanca,L119423,u666,RENAULT,Have you taken leave of your senses?
14467,m42,casablanca,L119422,u667,RICK,-- Not so fast Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
14468,m42,casablanca,L119399,u666,RENAULT,Serves me right for not being musical.
14469,m42,casablanca,L119398,u667,RICK,Sam's piano.
14470,m42,casablanca,L119397,u666,RENAULT,Tell me when we searched the place where were they?
14471,m42,casablanca,L119396,u667,RICK,I have the letters right here.
14472,m42,casablanca,L119395,u666,RENAULT,Is everything ready?
14473,m42,casablanca,L119394,u667,RICK,Yes I know what you mean but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
14474,m42,casablanca,L119393,u666,RENAULT,You know this place will never be the same without you Ricky.
14475,m42,casablanca,L119392,u666,RENAULT,Oh he won't be followed here.
14476,m42,casablanca,L119391,u667,RICK,I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
14477,m42,casablanca,L119390,u666,RENAULT,I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel so I knew I'd be on time.
14478,m42,casablanca,L119389,u667,RICK,You're late.
14479,m42,casablanca,L119376,u666,RENAULT,Go ahead Ricky.
14480,m42,casablanca,L119375,u667,RICK,Oh thanks.
14481,m42,casablanca,L119374,u666,RENAULT,Ricky I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
14482,m42,casablanca,L119373,u667,RICK,I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
14483,m42,casablanca,L119372,u666,RENAULT,I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
14484,m42,casablanca,L119371,u667,RICK,Well she isn't just any woman.
14485,m42,casablanca,L119370,u666,RENAULT,There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund she's very beautiful yes but you were never interested in any woman.
14486,m42,casablanca,L119369,u667,RICK,I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
14487,m42,casablanca,L119368,u667,RICK,Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
14488,m42,casablanca,L119367,u666,RENAULT,It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
14489,m42,casablanca,L119366,u667,RICK,Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him you can get something really big something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap wouldn't it?
14490,m42,casablanca,L119363,u666,RENAULT,You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
14491,m42,casablanca,L119362,u667,RICK,Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
14492,m42,casablanca,L119361,u666,RENAULT,What friend?
14493,m42,casablanca,L119360,u667,RICK,And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
14494,m42,casablanca,L119359,u666,RENAULT,Huh?
14495,m42,casablanca,L119358,u667,RICK,You're not very subtle but you are effective. I I get the point. Yes I have the letters but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane the last plane.
14496,m42,casablanca,L119357,u666,RENAULT,Don't count too much on my friendship Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides I might lose ten thousand francs.
14497,m42,casablanca,L119356,u667,RICK,Well they're all excellent reasons.
14498,m42,casablanca,L119355,u666,RENAULT,Because one you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two you have the letters of transit now don't bother to deny it. And well you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact I don't like him either.
14499,m42,casablanca,L119354,u667,RICK,-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
14500,m42,casablanca,L119353,u666,RENAULT,Ricky I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
14501,m42,casablanca,L119352,u667,RICK,But you haven't any actual proof and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
14502,m42,casablanca,L119215,u666,RENAULT,I am shocked shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
14503,m42,casablanca,L119214,u667,RICK,How can you close me up? On what grounds?
14504,m42,casablanca,L119183,u666,RENAULT,Well I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
14505,m42,casablanca,L119182,u667,RICK,Put it down as a gesture to love.
14506,m42,casablanca,L119181,u666,RENAULT,Why do you interfere with my little romances?
14507,m42,casablanca,L119180,u667,RICK,Yeah? Why?
14508,m42,casablanca,L119179,u666,RENAULT,As I suspected you're a rank sentimentalist.
14509,m42,casablanca,L119062,u666,RENAULT,Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later Rick.
14510,m42,casablanca,L119061,u667,RICK,So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
14511,m42,casablanca,L119060,u666,RENAULT,Huh?
14512,m42,casablanca,L119059,u667,RICK,Well it looks like you're a little late.
14513,m42,casablanca,L119058,u666,RENAULT,Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
14514,m42,casablanca,L119057,u667,RICK,Louis are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
14515,m42,casablanca,L119056,u666,RENAULT,Well I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick have you got these letters of transit?
14516,m42,casablanca,L119055,u667,RICK,That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
14517,m42,casablanca,L119054,u666,RENAULT,Well Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
14518,m42,casablanca,L118793,u666,RENAULT,Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing time of night.
14519,m42,casablanca,L118792,u667,RICK,Oh it's my party.
14520,m42,casablanca,L118770,u667,RICK,-- Thanks. I will.
14521,m42,casablanca,L118769,u666,RENAULT,Oh no Rick never --
14522,m42,casablanca,L118759,u667,RICK,-- Hello Ilsa.
14523,m42,casablanca,L118758,u666,RENAULT,Well you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle may I present --
14524,m42,casablanca,L118625,u667,RICK,I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
14525,m42,casablanca,L118624,u666,RENAULT,That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
14526,m42,casablanca,L118615,u666,RENAULT,And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
14527,m42,casablanca,L118614,u667,RICK,Oh how do you do?
14528,m42,casablanca,L118579,u666,RENAULT,Excuse me.
14529,m42,casablanca,L118578,u667,RICK,Yeah you were saying?
14530,m42,casablanca,L118575,u667,RICK,Oh I see. Gestapo spank.
14531,m42,casablanca,L118574,u666,RENAULT,I have my orders.
14532,m42,casablanca,L118573,u667,RICK,Maybe. Well it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
14533,m42,casablanca,L118572,u666,RENAULT,The winning side would have paid you much better.
14534,m42,casablanca,L118571,u667,RICK,And got well paid for it on both occasions.
14535,m42,casablanca,L118570,u666,RENAULT,Oh laugh if you will but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936 you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
14536,m42,casablanca,L118569,u666,RENAULT,Because my dear Ricky I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
14537,m42,casablanca,L118568,u667,RICK,Louis whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
14538,m42,casablanca,L118567,u666,RENAULT,It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
14539,m42,casablanca,L118566,u667,RICK,Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
14540,m42,casablanca,L118565,u666,RENAULT,I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles or in Oran he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
14541,m42,casablanca,L118564,u667,RICK,He'll take one.
14542,m42,casablanca,L118563,u666,RENAULT,He is traveling with a lady.
14543,m42,casablanca,L118562,u667,RICK,Why two?
14544,m42,casablanca,L118561,u666,RENAULT,Done. No matter how clever he is he still needs an exit visa or I should say two.
14545,m42,casablanca,L118560,u667,RICK,Okay.
14546,m42,casablanca,L118559,u666,RENAULT,Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
14547,m42,casablanca,L118558,u667,RICK,I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
14548,m42,casablanca,L118557,u666,RENAULT,Is that a serious offer?
14549,m42,casablanca,L118556,u667,RICK,Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
14550,m42,casablanca,L118555,u666,RENAULT,This is the end of the chase.
14551,m42,casablanca,L118554,u667,RICK,-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
14552,m42,casablanca,L118553,u666,RENAULT,Oh but I just told you. --
14553,m42,casablanca,L118552,u667,RICK,His escape.
14554,m42,casablanca,L118551,u666,RENAULT,Manages what?
14555,m42,casablanca,L118550,u667,RICK,It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
14556,m42,casablanca,L118549,u666,RENAULT,It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
14557,m42,casablanca,L118548,u667,RICK,Well he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
14558,m42,casablanca,L118547,u666,RENAULT,Rick that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
14559,m42,casablanca,L118546,u667,RICK,Victor Laszlo?
14560,m42,casablanca,L118545,u666,RENAULT,Victor Laszlo.
14561,m42,casablanca,L118544,u667,RICK,Yeah? What's his name?
14562,m42,casablanca,L118543,u666,RENAULT,That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
14563,m42,casablanca,L118542,u667,RICK,I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
14564,m42,casablanca,L118541,u666,RENAULT,Thank you. Rick there are many exit visas sold in this cafe but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
14565,m42,casablanca,L118540,u667,RICK,Yeah? Have a brandy?
14566,m42,casablanca,L118539,u666,RENAULT,How observant you are. As a matter of fact I wanted to give you a word of advice.
14567,m42,casablanca,L118534,u666,RENAULT,Perhaps not.
14568,m42,casablanca,L118533,u667,RICK,I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
14569,m42,casablanca,L118531,u667,RICK,Our entertainment is enough.
14570,m42,casablanca,L118530,u666,RENAULT,You know Rick we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
14571,m42,casablanca,L118529,u666,RENAULT,A wise foreign policy.
14572,m42,casablanca,L118528,u667,RICK,I stick my neck out for nobody.
14573,m42,casablanca,L118527,u666,RENAULT,If you are thinking of warning him don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
14574,m42,casablanca,L118526,u666,RENAULT,This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer no less.
14575,m42,casablanca,L118525,u667,RICK,What again?
14576,m42,casablanca,L118524,u666,RENAULT,Rick there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
14577,m42,casablanca,L118518,u666,RENAULT,Huh!
14578,m42,casablanca,L118517,u667,RICK,I was misinformed.
14579,m42,casablanca,L118516,u666,RENAULT,Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
14580,m42,casablanca,L118515,u667,RICK,My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
14581,m42,casablanca,L118514,u666,RENAULT,And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
14582,m42,casablanca,L118513,u667,RICK,It was a combination of all three.
14583,m42,casablanca,L118511,u666,RENAULT,The clipper to America.
14584,m42,casablanca,L118510,u667,RICK,Why? What's in Lisbon?
14585,m42,casablanca,L118509,u666,RENAULT,The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
14586,m42,casablanca,L118507,u667,RICK,When it comes to women you're a true democrat.
14587,m42,casablanca,L118506,u666,RENAULT,You know I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne maybe get her on the rebound eh?
14588,m42,casablanca,L118505,u666,RENAULT,How extravagant you are throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
14589,m42,casablanca,L118504,u667,RICK,Hello Louis.
14591,m42,casablanca,L118494,u667,RICK,Come on we're going to get your coat.
14592,m42,casablanca,L118492,u667,RICK,-- Sacha call a cab.
14595,m42,casablanca,L118488,u667,RICK,Sacha she's had enough.
14597,m42,casablanca,L118486,u667,RICK,I never make plans that far ahead.
14599,m42,casablanca,L118484,u667,RICK,That's so long ago I don't remember.
14601,m42,casablanca,L119495,u667,RICK,Put it down!
14602,m42,casablanca,L119494,u669,STRASSER,Get me the Radio Tower!
14603,m42,casablanca,L119493,u667,RICK,Put that phone down!
14604,m42,casablanca,L119492,u669,STRASSER,Hello?
14605,m42,casablanca,L119491,u667,RICK,I was willing to shoot Captain Renault and I'm willing to shoot you.
14606,m42,casablanca,L119490,u669,STRASSER,I would advise you not to interfere.
14607,m42,casablanca,L118651,u669,STRASSER,Good evening Mr. Blaine.
14608,m42,casablanca,L118650,u667,RICK,You'll excuse me gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
14609,m42,casablanca,L118647,u669,STRASSER,Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
14610,m42,casablanca,L118646,u667,RICK,Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound too.
14611,m42,casablanca,L118645,u669,STRASSER,In this case you have no sympathy for the fox huh?
14612,m42,casablanca,L118644,u667,RICK,My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
14613,m42,casablanca,L118643,u669,STRASSER,You will forgive my curiosity Mr. Blaine. The point is an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
14614,m42,casablanca,L118642,u667,RICK,Are my eyes really brown?
14615,m42,casablanca,L118636,u667,RICK,I haven't the slightest idea.
14616,m42,casablanca,L118635,u669,STRASSER,Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
14617,m42,casablanca,L118634,u667,RICK,Well there are certain sections of New York Major that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
14618,m42,casablanca,L118629,u667,RICK,It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
14619,m42,casablanca,L118628,u669,STRASSER,Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
14620,m42,casablanca,L118627,u667,RICK,There seems to be no secret about that.
14621,m42,casablanca,L118626,u669,STRASSER,I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
14622,m42,casablanca,L118623,u667,RICK,I'm a drunkard.
14623,m42,casablanca,L118622,u669,STRASSER,What is your nationality?
14624,m42,casablanca,L118621,u667,RICK,Make it official if you like.
14626,m42,casablanca,L118603,u667,RICK,Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
14629,m42,casablanca,L118452,u667,RICK,I don't want them here overnight.
14631,m42,casablanca,L118450,u667,RICK,For how long?
14634,m42,casablanca,L118446,u667,RICK,Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
14636,m42,casablanca,L118444,u667,RICK,I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
14638,m42,casablanca,L118442,u667,RICK,For a price Ugarte for a price.
14640,m42,casablanca,L118440,u667,RICK,If I gave you any thought I probably would.
14642,m42,casablanca,L118438,u667,RICK,No.
14645,m42,casablanca,L118434,u667,RICK,They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
14647,m42,casablanca,L118431,u667,RICK,-- You thought what?
14649,m42,casablanca,L118429,u667,RICK,Well what makes you think I haven't?
14651,m42,casablanca,L118423,u667,RICK,Hello Ugarte.
14654,m42,casablanca,L118889,u667,RICK,Where is she? Have you seen her?
14656,m42,casablanca,L118872,u667,RICK,And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.
14657,m42,casablanca,L118863,u667,RICK,You said it!  Here's looking at you kid.
14660,m42,casablanca,L118842,u667,RICK,If she can stand it I can. Play it!
14662,m42,casablanca,L118840,u667,RICK,You played it for her and you can play it for me.
14664,m42,casablanca,L118838,u667,RICK,Well stop it. You know what I want to hear.
14666,m42,casablanca,L118836,u667,RICK,What's that you're playing?
14667,m42,casablanca,L118834,u667,RICK,I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
14669,m42,casablanca,L118832,u667,RICK,Sam if it's December 1941 in Casablanca what time is it in New York?
14671,m42,casablanca,L118830,u667,RICK,They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well that's the way it goes. One in one out. Sam?
14673,m42,casablanca,L118828,u667,RICK,Shut up and go home will you?
14675,m42,casablanca,L118826,u667,RICK,She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
14677,m42,casablanca,L118824,u667,RICK,No sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
14679,m42,casablanca,L118822,u667,RICK,Then don't have a drink.
14681,m42,casablanca,L118820,u667,RICK,Good. Then have a drink.

14695,m42,casablanca,L118474,u667,RICK,Sam Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.

19293,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206826,u901,BRAD,Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
19295,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206824,u901,BRAD,Man I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
19297,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206667,u901,BRAD,Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
19299,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206665,u901,BRAD,What's there to do at the Point? God Lisa we've been going together almost two years and...
19300,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206662,u901,BRAD,Don't worry about it.
19302,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206660,u901,BRAD,Of course.
19304,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207325,u901,BRAD,Later.

19308,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207234,u914,SPICOLI,On the ledge?
19309,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207233,u901,BRAD,It's the first door on your left!
19310,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207232,u914,SPICOLI,I can't find it mon!
19311,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207231,u901,BRAD,It's the first door on your left.
19312,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207230,u914,SPICOLI,Totally.
19313,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207229,u901,BRAD,Go ahead. Just make it quick.
19314,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206458,u901,BRAD,Come on Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
19315,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206457,u914,SPICOLI,Something happened to them mon.
19317,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207048,u901,BRAD,You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
19319,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207046,u901,BRAD,I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
19321,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207044,u901,BRAD,This is how I dress all the time.
19324,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206780,u901,BRAD,Mister if you don't shut up I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
19326,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206778,u901,BRAD,I'm sorry sir. Just let me find the forms here.
19328,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206776,u901,BRAD,I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
19330,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206774,u901,BRAD,Well that's not the way it works really. And you ate most of your food already too...
19332,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206772,u901,BRAD,Well I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
19333,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207201,u901,BRAD,All right then. It's your secret.
19334,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207200,u915,STACY,No.
19335,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207199,u901,BRAD,You're not going to tell me are you?
19336,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207197,u915,STACY,Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
19337,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207196,u901,BRAD,Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
19338,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207183,u915,STACY,Thanks a lot Brad. I really appreciate it.
19339,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207182,u901,BRAD,See you later.
19340,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207181,u915,STACY,Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
19341,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206999,u915,STACY,It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
19342,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206998,u901,BRAD,Does Mom know you have company?
19343,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206694,u901,BRAD,Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
19344,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206693,u915,STACY,Maybe yes. Maybe no.
19345,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206692,u901,BRAD,Are you still a virgin?
19346,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206691,u915,STACY,But your face did!
19347,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206690,u901,BRAD,I didn't say that.
19348,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206689,u915,STACY,You are a virgin!
19349,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206688,u901,BRAD,Maybe yes. Maybe no.
19350,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206687,u915,STACY,I don't know. I was just curious.
19351,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206686,u901,BRAD,Why?
19352,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206685,u915,STACY,Hey Brad. Are you still a virgin?
19353,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206684,u901,BRAD,Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
19354,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206683,u915,STACY,Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
19355,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206682,u901,BRAD,Well... it's true.
19356,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206681,u915,STACY,I'm just guessing.
19357,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206680,u901,BRAD,Where did you hear that?
19358,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206679,u915,STACY,Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
19359,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206678,u901,BRAD,I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
19360,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206677,u915,STACY,You're going to break up with Lisa aren't you?
19361,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206676,u901,BRAD,Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
19362,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206675,u915,STACY,Is everything okay at work?
19363,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206674,u901,BRAD,I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
19364,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206673,u915,STACY,It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
19365,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206672,u901,BRAD,Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
19366,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206671,u915,STACY,Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
19367,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206633,u915,STACY,I'll explain everything later.
19368,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206632,u901,BRAD,I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
19369,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206631,u915,STACY,Brad what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
19370,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206630,u901,BRAD,They're not home yet.
19371,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206629,u915,STACY,Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
19372,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206628,u915,STACY,Don't strain yourself.
19373,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206627,u901,BRAD,I take out the garbage.
19374,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206626,u915,STACY,Your friends use the pool too.
19375,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206625,u901,BRAD,Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
19376,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206624,u915,STACY,Why can't you do it?
19377,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206623,u901,BRAD,Mom says to clean up the pool.
19378,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206509,u901,BRAD,Hey-yo.
19379,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206508,u915,STACY,U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
19380,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206507,u901,BRAD,Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
19381,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206504,u901,BRAD,Sis.
19382,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206503,u915,STACY,Hi Brad.
19384,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206788,u901,BRAD,Yes sir.
19386,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206786,u901,BRAD,He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
19388,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206768,u901,BRAD,Okay Dennis.
19390,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206464,u901,BRAD,But they weren't mine.
19392,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206462,u901,BRAD,They were left over from the last shift.
19394,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206460,u901,BRAD,No just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it Dennis.
19396,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207263,u914,SPICOLI,Go away Curtis. If you can't knock I can't hear you.
19399,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206818,u914,SPICOLI,Leave me alone.
19401,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206816,u914,SPICOLI,Leave me alone!
19402,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206815,u914,SPICOLI,Ugh.
19404,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207259,u915,STACY,Get going.
19405,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207258,u904,DAMONE,All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
19406,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207257,u915,STACY,Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
19407,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207170,u904,DAMONE,Seventy-five dollars and a ride. Okay.
19408,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207169,u915,STACY,Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
19409,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207168,u904,DAMONE,Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
19410,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207167,u915,STACY,It's already planned Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
19411,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207166,u904,DAMONE,Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
19412,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207165,u915,STACY,We've got to get an abortion?
19413,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207164,u904,DAMONE,There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
19414,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207163,u904,DAMONE,All right I take it back.
19415,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207162,u915,STACY,Take that back.
19416,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207160,u915,STACY,I know it's yours.
19417,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207159,u904,DAMONE,How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
19418,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207158,u915,STACY,Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
19419,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207157,u904,DAMONE,Why don't you call me up tonight?
19420,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207156,u904,DAMONE,What? Now?
19421,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207155,u915,STACY,Mike there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
19422,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207154,u904,DAMONE,What's going on?
19423,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207115,u904,DAMONE,Hello.
19424,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207114,u915,STACY,I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
19425,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207113,u904,DAMONE,Look I'm kind of in a hurry.
19426,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207112,u915,STACY,I didn't see you this morning.
19427,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207111,u904,DAMONE,Oh. Hi.
19428,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207092,u915,STACY,I guess I did.
19429,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207091,u904,DAMONE,I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
19430,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207090,u915,STACY,What's wrong?
19431,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207089,u904,DAMONE,I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
19432,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207088,u915,STACY,I think we're making a lot of noise.
19433,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207087,u904,DAMONE,What? Are you all right?
19434,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207086,u915,STACY,Hey Mike?
19435,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207085,u904,DAMONE,Let's continue.
19436,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207084,u915,STACY,I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
19437,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207083,u915,STACY,How about both of us at the same time?
19438,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207082,u904,DAMONE,You first.
19439,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207081,u915,STACY,Why don't you take off your clothes Mike?
19440,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207080,u904,DAMONE,No. Are you crazy?
19441,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207079,u915,STACY,So are you.  Are you shaking?
19442,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207078,u904,DAMONE,You're a really good kisser.
19443,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207077,u915,STACY,He's my friend too.
19444,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207076,u904,DAMONE,Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you and he's my friend.
19445,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207074,u904,DAMONE,Come on...
19446,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207073,u915,STACY,Are you really a virgin?
19447,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207072,u904,DAMONE,I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
19448,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207071,u915,STACY,Pick a suit.
19449,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207067,u915,STACY,Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
19450,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207066,u904,DAMONE,Well...
19451,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207065,u915,STACY,Do you want to take a quick swim?
19452,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207064,u904,DAMONE,I know what I look like.
19453,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207063,u915,STACY,Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
19454,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207062,u904,DAMONE,I don't know.
19455,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207061,u915,STACY,I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
19456,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207060,u915,STACY,Sure. Come on in.
19457,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207059,u904,DAMONE,Do you have any ice tea?
19458,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207056,u915,STACY,Mark is a really nice boy...
19459,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207055,u904,DAMONE,You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
19460,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207054,u904,DAMONE,What a guy.
19461,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207053,u915,STACY,Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings and then drives to school himself.
19462,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207052,u904,DAMONE,Get a ride with somebody.
19463,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207051,u915,STACY,I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
19464,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206996,u915,STACY,O-kay you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
19465,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206995,u904,DAMONE,Well that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
19466,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206989,u915,STACY,Oh really?
19467,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206988,u904,DAMONE,Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
19468,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206899,u915,STACY,Nice to meet you.
19469,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206898,u904,DAMONE,Nice to meet you Stacy.
19470,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207356,u916,THE RAT,It's a way Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out and I have personally found that girls do respond.
19471,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207355,u904,DAMONE,Yeah well I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
19472,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207354,u916,THE RAT,Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
19473,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207353,u904,DAMONE,What do you read? What's the last book you read?
19474,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207352,u916,THE RAT,Well for one I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
19475,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207351,u904,DAMONE,So what makes you so sensitive?
19476,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207350,u916,THE RAT,Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
19477,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207349,u904,DAMONE,Sensitive -- what is that?
19478,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207348,u916,THE RAT,And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
19479,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207347,u904,DAMONE,Whatever you say Rat.
19480,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207346,u916,THE RAT,The Attitude Damone is only good until you meet the right girl.
19481,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207308,u904,DAMONE,You're crazy. Those girls love me.
19482,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207307,u916,THE RAT,You're losing it Damone.
19483,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207222,u904,DAMONE,Fine. Get lost.
19484,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207221,u916,THE RAT,I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well you know Damone maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
19485,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207220,u904,DAMONE,Jesus. I'm sorry.
19486,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207219,u916,THE RAT,Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
19487,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207218,u904,DAMONE,She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
19488,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207217,u916,THE RAT,No Damone. I don't understand.
19489,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207216,u904,DAMONE,If you ask me she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
19490,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207010,u916,THE RAT,Chicken!
19491,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207009,u904,DAMONE,No. I don't think so. Not right now.
19492,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207006,u916,THE RAT,Really.
19493,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207005,u904,DAMONE,Poor guy.
19494,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206897,u916,THE RAT,Okay. See ya.
19495,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206896,u904,DAMONE,Well I've gotta be running.
19496,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206895,u916,THE RAT,Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey Damone have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy this is Mike Damone.
19497,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206894,u904,DAMONE,I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
19498,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206893,u916,THE RAT,Damone! You come here?
19499,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206892,u904,DAMONE,Hey Mark. Is that you?
19500,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206885,u904,DAMONE,I'm really pretty busy...
19501,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206884,u916,THE RAT,Damone are you there?
19502,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206883,u916,THE RAT,No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone I've got to ask you this favor and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car go by my house get my wallet and meet me back here?
19503,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206882,u904,DAMONE,Did you go home and get it?
19504,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206881,u916,THE RAT,It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
19505,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206880,u904,DAMONE,Mark. What happened to your date?
19506,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206879,u916,THE RAT,Damone. It's Mark.
19507,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206878,u904,DAMONE,Yo.
19508,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206856,u904,DAMONE,You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...
19509,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206855,u916,THE RAT,I think I've got it. Once I get going I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean I hardly know her.
19510,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206854,u904,DAMONE,And that is how you talk to a girl Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
19511,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206850,u904,DAMONE,All right. Pay attention.
19512,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206849,u916,THE RAT,Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
19513,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206848,u904,DAMONE,What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
19514,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206847,u916,THE RAT,Knock it off Damone. I need real help.
19515,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206750,u904,DAMONE,Ace the jacket.
19516,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206749,u916,THE RAT,Yeah?
19517,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206748,u904,DAMONE,Hey Rat.
19518,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206737,u904,DAMONE,There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall.
19519,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206736,u916,THE RAT,I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
19520,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206735,u904,DAMONE,The business is changing Rat. I'll tell you these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
19521,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206658,u916,THE RAT,The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes stays lays or prays. Whatever happens your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
19522,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206657,u904,DAMONE,That's the idea Rat. That's The Attitude.
19523,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206656,u916,THE RAT,Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks you know something's gonna happen.
19524,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206655,u904,DAMONE,Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
19525,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206653,u904,DAMONE,Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
19526,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206652,u916,THE RAT,You tell me Mike. What do I do?
19527,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206651,u904,DAMONE,I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
19528,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206650,u916,THE RAT,Really?
19529,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206649,u904,DAMONE,I would. Yeah.
19530,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206648,u916,THE RAT,Well what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
19531,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206647,u904,DAMONE,It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
19532,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206646,u916,THE RAT,No. It's too soon.
19533,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206645,u904,DAMONE,Did you get her name?
19534,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206644,u916,THE RAT,No.
19535,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206643,u904,DAMONE,Did you get her number?
19536,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206642,u916,THE RAT,She's in my biology class.
19537,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206641,u904,DAMONE,All right... where did you see her?
19538,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206640,u916,THE RAT,Damone you gotta listen to me.
19539,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206639,u904,DAMONE,It's definitely your mama.
19540,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206638,u916,THE RAT,What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
19541,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206637,u904,DAMONE,You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
19542,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206438,u904,DAMONE,You should work for yourself.
19543,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206437,u916,THE RAT,Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
19544,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206486,u910,LINDA,And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
19546,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206484,u910,LINDA,Not if you're over sixteen.
19548,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206482,u910,LINDA,All right what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
19550,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206478,u910,LINDA,Yes.
19552,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206813,u914,SPICOLI,Merv I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
19554,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206811,u914,SPICOLI,Totally.
19556,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206809,u914,SPICOLI,That's me Merv.
19559,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206806,u914,SPICOLI,Merv this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
19560,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206805,u914,SPICOLI,Well it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter you want to run with it?
19562,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206803,u914,SPICOLI,I don't go at all.
19564,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206801,u914,SPICOLI,School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something all you have to do is go about half the time.
19566,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206799,u914,SPICOLI,Seriously Merv everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend maybe going up to the mountains.
19567,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206798,u914,SPICOLI,I've been swimming Merv.
19569,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206796,u914,SPICOLI,Outrageous Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
19571,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207331,u914,SPICOLI,Hey mon I don't know what your trip is but...
19574,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206958,u914,SPICOLI,Will you just relax mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
19576,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206956,u914,SPICOLI,Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit or is he gonna kill us?
19578,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206954,u914,SPICOLI,Just be glad you're all right.
19580,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206949,u914,SPICOLI,You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
19582,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206946,u914,SPICOLI,All right. Die Granada Jocks!
19585,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206943,u914,SPICOLI,It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
19587,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206940,u914,SPICOLI,What the fuck is this guy doing?
19589,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206935,u914,SPICOLI,All right.
19591,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206933,u914,SPICOLI,Naw. Any good?
19593,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206931,u914,SPICOLI,Then don't hassle it.
19595,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206929,u914,SPICOLI,I thought he was out of town.
19597,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207305,u915,STACY,Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
19598,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207304,u910,LINDA,There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
19599,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207303,u915,STACY,I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
19600,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207302,u910,LINDA,I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
19601,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207301,u915,STACY,Dartmouth?!
19602,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207300,u910,LINDA,Well I might go to Dartmouth.
19603,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207299,u915,STACY,But what are you going to do?
19604,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207298,u910,LINDA,Yeah like maybe never.
19605,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207297,u915,STACY,Sometime?
19606,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207296,u910,LINDA,He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
19607,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207295,u915,STACY,Not coming? What happened?
19608,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207294,u910,LINDA,He's not coming.
19609,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207293,u915,STACY,Where's Doug?
19610,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207256,u910,LINDA,Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
19611,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207255,u915,STACY,I want romance.
19612,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207254,u910,LINDA,What do you want?
19613,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207253,u915,STACY,You know Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
19614,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207252,u910,LINDA,Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
19615,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207251,u915,STACY,Another summer of working at Swenson's.
19616,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207209,u910,LINDA,Stacy he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
19617,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207208,u915,STACY,Don't do anything Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
19618,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207207,u910,LINDA,There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
19619,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207206,u915,STACY,I paid for it and everything.
19620,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207205,u910,LINDA,That little prick.
19621,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207204,u915,STACY,Then I called his house and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
19622,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207203,u910,LINDA,That little prick.
19623,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207202,u915,STACY,I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
19624,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207153,u910,LINDA,You're right. I didn't tell you that.
19625,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207152,u915,STACY,You didn't tell me that they can be so nice so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
19626,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207151,u910,LINDA,What?
19627,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207150,u915,STACY,You know there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
19628,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207149,u910,LINDA,But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
19629,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207148,u915,STACY,I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
19630,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207147,u910,LINDA,Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson you'd be out to here!
19631,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207146,u915,STACY,It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
19632,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207145,u910,LINDA,It couldn't be.
19633,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207144,u915,STACY,What do you think it is?
19634,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207143,u910,LINDA,What do you think it is?
19635,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207142,u915,STACY,I don't know... I just don't feel right.
19636,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207141,u910,LINDA,You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
19637,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207140,u915,STACY,I don't know I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
19638,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207139,u910,LINDA,God Stacy it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
19639,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207012,u915,STACY,God I don't think so. Better look in the house.
19640,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207011,u910,LINDA,Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
19641,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207004,u915,STACY,I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
19642,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207003,u910,LINDA,God he hardly even talks anymore.
19643,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206994,u910,LINDA,No.
19644,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206993,u915,STACY,I didn't ask for any help. Did you Linda?
19645,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206992,u910,LINDA,I think they're both virgins.
19646,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206991,u915,STACY,What do you think?
19647,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206986,u910,LINDA,He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
19648,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206985,u915,STACY,What's Doug do in Chicago?
19649,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206984,u910,LINDA,I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
19650,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206983,u915,STACY,How long does Doug take?
19651,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206981,u915,STACY,Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex but they don't have real orgasms.'
19652,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206980,u910,LINDA,No. But it's a nice idea.
19653,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206979,u915,STACY,Does that ever happen?
19654,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206978,u910,LINDA,Climax together.
19655,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206977,u915,STACY,All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first you climax first you and your mate climax together?'
19656,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206976,u910,LINDA,You're right. Probably penis mouth and neck.
19657,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206975,u915,STACY,Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
19658,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206974,u910,LINDA,Okay penis that's one balls...
19659,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206973,u915,STACY,Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
19660,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206972,u910,LINDA,Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
19661,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206971,u915,STACY,You really ought to look at this Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
19662,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206970,u910,LINDA,I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
19663,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206837,u915,STACY,Sixteen.
19664,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206836,u910,LINDA,Oh come on. What is he? Fifteen?
19665,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206835,u915,STACY,What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know Mark Ratner.
19666,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206733,u915,STACY,Thanks a lot.
19667,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206732,u910,LINDA,Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
19668,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206731,u915,STACY,I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
19669,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206730,u910,LINDA,Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home fifty years old and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
19670,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206729,u915,STACY,Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
19671,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206727,u915,STACY,Not since November.
19672,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206726,u910,LINDA,I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
19673,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206725,u915,STACY,I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
19674,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206724,u910,LINDA,You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
19675,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206700,u910,LINDA,Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
19676,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206699,u915,STACY,If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
19677,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206698,u910,LINDA,Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
19678,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206697,u915,STACY,Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
19679,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206696,u910,LINDA,Don't you dare you'll never hear from him again.
19680,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206695,u915,STACY,There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
19681,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206622,u910,LINDA,Hey! That's my line!
19682,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206621,u915,STACY,Come on Linda. It's just sex.
19683,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206620,u910,LINDA,So tell me do you like Ron? Is it serious?
19684,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206619,u915,STACY,It was nice.
19685,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206618,u910,LINDA,You'll always remember your first time.
19686,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206617,u915,STACY,It was okay.
19687,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206616,u910,LINDA,Was it great?
19688,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206583,u915,STACY,Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
19689,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206582,u910,LINDA,Just kidding. About 10cc.
19690,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206579,u910,LINDA,There's nothing to it.
19691,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206578,u915,STACY,Well I never did it.
19692,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206577,u910,LINDA,What's the big deal?
19693,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206576,u915,STACY,Like you know giving blow jobs.
19694,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206575,u910,LINDA,What variables?
19695,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206574,u915,STACY,No there are variables that like I might not be good at.
19696,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206573,u910,LINDA,What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
19697,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206572,u915,STACY,Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
19698,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206571,u910,LINDA,Oh give me a break Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
19699,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206570,u915,STACY,Do you think guys find that attractive?
19700,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206567,u910,LINDA,I know.
19701,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206566,u915,STACY,Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
19702,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206561,u910,LINDA,God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
19703,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206560,u915,STACY,No way! He just called him a dick.
19704,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206559,u910,LINDA,I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
19705,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206488,u910,LINDA,Believe it.
19706,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206487,u915,STACY,I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
19707,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206476,u910,LINDA,If I didn't have a fiancé in Chicago I'd go for it.
19708,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206475,u915,STACY,He was hot wasn't he?
19709,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206474,u910,LINDA,Stacy what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't one of the other girls will.
19710,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206473,u915,STACY,Really?
19711,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206472,u910,LINDA,Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
19712,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206471,u915,STACY,I can't do that.
19713,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206470,u910,LINDA,I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
19714,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206469,u915,STACY,So what did you do?
19715,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206468,u910,LINDA,Listen Stace you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well guess what? They don't call.
19716,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206467,u915,STACY,Come on Linda I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
19717,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206466,u910,LINDA,Should we buy a frame for that?
19718,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206465,u915,STACY,He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson Audio Consultant.'
19719,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206431,u910,LINDA,Just take his order look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny laugh a lot.
19720,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206430,u915,STACY,What should I do?
19721,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206429,u910,LINDA,Come on Stacy it's your section and your man.
19722,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206428,u915,STACY,Yeah but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
19723,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206427,u910,LINDA,Don't you like him?
19724,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206424,u915,STACY,Do you think that guy's cute?
19725,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206423,u910,LINDA,How's it going.
19727,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207291,u914,SPICOLI,Aloha Mr. Hand!
19728,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207290,u914,SPICOLI,All right! Oh yeah!
19730,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207288,u914,SPICOLI,You're gonna flunk me?!
19732,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207286,u914,SPICOLI,No way mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
19734,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207284,u914,SPICOLI,Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
19736,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207282,u914,SPICOLI,Hey Mr. Hand can I ask you a question?
19739,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207277,u914,SPICOLI,Hey it's in my locker Mr. Hand.
19742,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207273,u914,SPICOLI,I don't know. I guess so.
19744,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207271,u914,SPICOLI,Did I do something wrong Mr. Hand?
19746,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207269,u914,SPICOLI,Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
19749,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207265,u914,SPICOLI,Mr... Mr. Hand.
19751,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207034,u914,SPICOLI,You better save some for me you swine!
19752,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207030,u914,SPICOLI,I've been thinking about this Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
19754,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207028,u914,SPICOLI,Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
19756,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206718,u914,SPICOLI,I don't know.
19758,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206716,u914,SPICOLI,I don't know mon. The food lines took forever.
19760,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206714,u914,SPICOLI,I couldn't make it in time.
19762,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206712,u914,SPICOLI,Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
19763,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206534,u914,SPICOLI,Hey bud. What's your problem?
19765,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206532,u914,SPICOLI,You just ripped my card in two!
19766,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206531,u914,SPICOLI,That's the name they gave me.
19769,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206527,u914,SPICOLI,Can I come in?
19771,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206525,u914,SPICOLI,This is U.S. History right? I saw the globe in the window.
19773,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206523,u914,SPICOLI,Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
19774,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206615,u915,STACY,Yes.
19777,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206612,u915,STACY,What about those other guys you live with?
19779,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206610,u915,STACY,Yes... I am really nineteen.
19781,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206608,u915,STACY,It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
19784,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206605,u915,STACY,That's a nice shirt.
19786,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206603,u915,STACY,The point sounds fine.
19788,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206601,u915,STACY,I don't know. Wherever you want.
19790,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206599,u915,STACY,Thanks. So do you.
19793,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206596,u915,STACY,Thanks for picking me up.
19795,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206435,u915,STACY,What can I get for you tonight.
19796,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206434,u915,STACY,I know everyone says that.
19798,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207343,u915,STACY,I'd like that.
19799,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207342,u916,THE RAT,Well I don't know I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
19800,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207341,u915,STACY,Yeah. I want you to have this picture so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
19801,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207340,u916,THE RAT,Really?
19802,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207339,u915,STACY,I know everybody says it but I really mean it.
19803,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207338,u916,THE RAT,Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
19804,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207337,u915,STACY,I'm fine. Mark I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
19805,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207336,u916,THE RAT,Hi Stacy. How are you?
19806,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207335,u915,STACY,Hi Mark.
19807,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207134,u916,THE RAT,I'll get you the notes.
19808,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207133,u915,STACY,What about the notes?
19809,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207132,u916,THE RAT,Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out we'll blend back in.
19810,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207131,u915,STACY,I made a fool of myself.
19811,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207100,u915,STACY,Oh. I see.
19812,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207099,u916,THE RAT,John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
19813,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207098,u915,STACY,John Bonham?
19814,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207097,u916,THE RAT,It's John Bonham's birthday.
19815,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207096,u915,STACY,What's April 16th?
19816,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207095,u916,THE RAT,Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
19817,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L207094,u915,STACY,Where's Mike today?
19818,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206925,u916,THE RAT,Well... it's getting kind of late.
19819,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206924,u915,STACY,Do you really have to go?
19820,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206923,u916,THE RAT,...I've got to go home.
19821,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206921,u916,THE RAT,Oh yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
19822,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206920,u915,STACY,This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
19823,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206919,u916,THE RAT,Sure.
19824,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206918,u915,STACY,Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid right?
19825,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206917,u916,THE RAT,I don't know.
19826,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206916,u915,STACY,Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
19827,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206915,u916,THE RAT,So... pretty nice house you've got here.
19828,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206911,u916,THE RAT,Naw. I don't mind.
19829,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206910,u915,STACY,Well I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
19830,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206909,u916,THE RAT,No. That's okay.
19831,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206908,u915,STACY,I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
19832,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206907,u916,THE RAT,Where's your brother?
19833,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206906,u916,THE RAT,Okay. Sure. I'll come in.
19834,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206905,u915,STACY,No they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
19835,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206904,u916,THE RAT,Aren't your parents asleep?
19836,m59,fast times at ridgemont high,L206903,u915,STACY,Do you want to come inside?

25765,m78,grand hotel,L254008,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Life gentlemen is wonderful but very dangerous. You must have courage for it then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
25767,m78,grand hotel,L254006,u1191,KRINGELEIN,I oughtn't to presume but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh you can laugh gentlemen but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!

25776,m78,grand hotel,L253930,u1184,BARON,I'll pay you back.
25778,m78,grand hotel,L253928,u1184,BARON,I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
25780,m78,grand hotel,L253926,u1184,BARON,I've quit.
25781,m78,grand hotel,L253447,u1184,BARON,With the pearls --
25783,m78,grand hotel,L253445,u1184,BARON,Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
25785,m78,grand hotel,L253443,u1184,BARON,I don't like your tone.
25787,m78,grand hotel,L253441,u1184,BARON,Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides she's very pretty -- not young but --

25799,m78,grand hotel,L253429,u1184,BARON,I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
25801,m78,grand hotel,L253427,u1184,BARON,I've been careful I've been waiting my chance.
25803,m78,grand hotel,L253425,u1184,BARON,The pearls are in her room.
25805,m78,grand hotel,L253423,u1184,BARON,Yes.

25822,m78,grand hotel,L254052,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
25823,m78,grand hotel,L254051,u1184,BARON,Flaemmchen what are you doing here in the middle of the night.

25827,m78,grand hotel,L253837,u1184,BARON,I thought that too -- but I found that it does. Come along dance with Kringelein.
25828,m78,grand hotel,L253836,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
25829,m78,grand hotel,L253835,u1184,BARON,I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
25830,m78,grand hotel,L253834,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
25831,m78,grand hotel,L253833,u1184,BARON,I feel sorry for him.
25832,m78,grand hotel,L253832,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Why?
25833,m78,grand hotel,L253831,u1184,BARON,Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
25834,m78,grand hotel,L253830,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Yes -- I'd love to.

25847,m78,grand hotel,L253270,u1184,BARON,We'll dance.
25848,m78,grand hotel,L253269,u1184,BARON,Really?

25858,m78,grand hotel,L253259,u1184,BARON,What?
25859,m78,grand hotel,L253258,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Aren't you?
25860,m78,grand hotel,L253257,u1184,BARON,Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
25861,m78,grand hotel,L253256,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
25862,m78,grand hotel,L253255,u1184,BARON,Too bad.
25863,m78,grand hotel,L253254,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Very little.
25864,m78,grand hotel,L253253,u1184,BARON,Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
25865,m78,grand hotel,L253252,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Money -- Ever heard of it?
25866,m78,grand hotel,L253251,u1184,BARON,Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
25867,m78,grand hotel,L253250,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,No -- why? -- should I?
25868,m78,grand hotel,L253249,u1184,BARON,Reducing?
25869,m78,grand hotel,L253248,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day I'd hate to spoil it.
25870,m78,grand hotel,L253247,u1184,BARON,Oh... poor child. If you were free I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
25871,m78,grand hotel,L253246,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Dictation.  You know...
25872,m78,grand hotel,L253245,u1184,BARON,Oh!

25877,m78,grand hotel,L253240,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Have you seen it?
25878,m78,grand hotel,L253239,u1184,BARON,Whoever is keeping you waiting.
25879,m78,grand hotel,L253238,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Who?
25880,m78,grand hotel,L253237,u1184,BARON,He must be very nice.

25891,m78,grand hotel,L253948,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,I'm worried about you.
25892,m78,grand hotel,L253947,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,They've brought me such good luck -- you --
25893,m78,grand hotel,L253946,u1184,BARON,Why?
25894,m78,grand hotel,L253945,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Why do you think --
25895,m78,grand hotel,L253944,u1184,BARON,No! I can't explain now. Oh look -- the pearls. You wear them now...

25901,m78,grand hotel,L253689,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
25902,m78,grand hotel,L253688,u1184,BARON,I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
25903,m78,grand hotel,L253687,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
25904,m78,grand hotel,L253685,u1184,BARON,Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
25905,m78,grand hotel,L253684,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
25906,m78,grand hotel,L253683,u1184,BARON,Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
25907,m78,grand hotel,L253682,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
25908,m78,grand hotel,L253681,u1184,BARON,I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
25909,m78,grand hotel,L253680,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Why later?
25910,m78,grand hotel,L253679,u1184,BARON,Oh -- yes but -- later.

25927,m78,grand hotel,L253646,u1184,BARON,I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
25928,m78,grand hotel,L253645,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,And now?
25929,m78,grand hotel,L253644,u1184,BARON,I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night at last I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
25930,m78,grand hotel,L253643,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,But now you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
25931,m78,grand hotel,L253642,u1184,BARON,Yesterday I was a thief -- but now --
25932,m78,grand hotel,L253641,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,So --

25934,m78,grand hotel,L253639,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,I'll not denounce you.
25935,m78,grand hotel,L253638,u1184,BARON,I don't want them now.
25936,m78,grand hotel,L253637,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
25937,m78,grand hotel,L253635,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Oh -- 
25938,m78,grand hotel,L253634,u1184,BARON,There.
25939,m78,grand hotel,L253632,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,What is the matter?
25940,m78,grand hotel,L253631,u1184,BARON,Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
25941,m78,grand hotel,L253630,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,That's a silly joke.
25942,m78,grand hotel,L253629,u1184,BARON,I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
25943,m78,grand hotel,L253628,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
25944,m78,grand hotel,L253627,u1184,BARON,I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig devouring anything of life that pleases me I really belong in jail
25945,m78,grand hotel,L253626,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,And what do you do -- now?
25946,m78,grand hotel,L253625,u1184,BARON,And then in the war to kill and hide. That's all.
25947,m78,grand hotel,L253624,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,And?
25948,m78,grand hotel,L253623,u1184,BARON,When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school it was a monastery I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
25949,m78,grand hotel,L253622,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,No?
25950,m78,grand hotel,L253621,u1184,BARON,Really I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
25951,m78,grand hotel,L253620,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Really?
25952,m78,grand hotel,L253619,u1184,BARON,I'm a prodigal son the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
25953,m78,grand hotel,L253618,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
25954,m78,grand hotel,L253617,u1184,BARON,I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
25955,m78,grand hotel,L253616,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you really? -- I do not even know your name.
25956,m78,grand hotel,L253539,u1184,BARON,That is not the truth.  You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate just now if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it. 
25957,m78,grand hotel,L253538,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,I want to be alone.
25958,m78,grand hotel,L253537,u1184,BARON,The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
25959,m78,grand hotel,L253536,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,What?
25960,m78,grand hotel,L253535,u1184,BARON,I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
25961,m78,grand hotel,L253533,u1184,BARON,Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
25962,m78,grand hotel,L253532,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,No.
25963,m78,grand hotel,L253531,u1184,BARON,You are beautiful!
25964,m78,grand hotel,L253530,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,What can you see?
25965,m78,grand hotel,L253529,u1184,BARON,Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- 
25966,m78,grand hotel,L253528,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Why do you smile?
25967,m78,grand hotel,L253527,u1184,BARON,I should like to smoke.
25968,m78,grand hotel,L253526,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
25969,m78,grand hotel,L253525,u1184,BARON,I? -- Oh no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
25970,m78,grand hotel,L253524,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
25971,m78,grand hotel,L253520,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Just for a minute then.
25972,m78,grand hotel,L253519,u1184,BARON,No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you you'd feel worse than you did before You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
25973,m78,grand hotel,L253518,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,I want to be alone --
25974,m78,grand hotel,L253517,u1184,BARON,That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
25975,m78,grand hotel,L253516,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,I want to be alone.
25976,m78,grand hotel,L253515,u1184,BARON,I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
25977,m78,grand hotel,L253514,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
25978,m78,grand hotel,L253513,u1184,BARON,Yes -- I do understand.
25979,m78,grand hotel,L253512,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
25980,m78,grand hotel,L253511,u1184,BARON,I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
25981,m78,grand hotel,L253510,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
25982,m78,grand hotel,L253509,u1184,BARON,A man who could love -- that is all who has forgotten everything else for you.
25983,m78,grand hotel,L253508,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Go away. Who are you --?
25984,m78,grand hotel,L253507,u1184,BARON,I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
25985,m78,grand hotel,L253506,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
25986,m78,grand hotel,L253505,u1184,BARON,And...?
25987,m78,grand hotel,L253504,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know once when the Grand Duke was alive I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
25988,m78,grand hotel,L253503,u1184,BARON,Am I quite strange to you?
25989,m78,grand hotel,L253502,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Strange man...
25990,m78,grand hotel,L253501,u1184,BARON,You mustn't talk Russian to me.
25991,m78,grand hotel,L253500,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Alone. All alone.  Oh you strange -- strange creature.
25992,m78,grand hotel,L253499,u1184,BARON,So alone.
25993,m78,grand hotel,L253498,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Yes -- tired...
25994,m78,grand hotel,L253497,u1184,BARON,How tired you are!
25995,m78,grand hotel,L253496,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,And -- and --
25996,m78,grand hotel,L253495,u1184,BARON,No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
25997,m78,grand hotel,L253494,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,And then --?
25998,m78,grand hotel,L253493,u1184,BARON,I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
25999,m78,grand hotel,L253492,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Why do you look at me like that?
26000,m78,grand hotel,L253491,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Certainly.
26001,m78,grand hotel,L253490,u1184,BARON,I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
26002,m78,grand hotel,L253489,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
26003,m78,grand hotel,L253488,u1184,BARON,I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
26004,m78,grand hotel,L253487,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
26005,m78,grand hotel,L253486,u1184,BARON,Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
26006,m78,grand hotel,L253485,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
26007,m78,grand hotel,L253484,u1184,BARON,Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
26008,m78,grand hotel,L253483,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Because you love me -- you love me?
26009,m78,grand hotel,L253482,u1184,BARON,But surely you must know -- because I love you.
26010,m78,grand hotel,L253481,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Why do you hide in my room?
26011,m78,grand hotel,L253480,u1184,BARON,Nothing -- only to be here.
26012,m78,grand hotel,L253479,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,What do you want here?
26013,m78,grand hotel,L253478,u1184,BARON,Please do not be frightened Madam.
26014,m78,grand hotel,L254048,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Oh no stay here Baron -- stay.
26015,m78,grand hotel,L254047,u1184,BARON,You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight Kringelein.
26016,m78,grand hotel,L254043,u1191,KRINGELEIN,No -- no please -- oh don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone Baron.
26017,m78,grand hotel,L254042,u1184,BARON,Goodnight Kringelein. 
26018,m78,grand hotel,L254041,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me Baron.
26019,m78,grand hotel,L254040,u1184,BARON,Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook Kringelein.
26020,m78,grand hotel,L253992,u1191,KRINGELEIN,All of that at once Baron?
26021,m78,grand hotel,L253991,u1184,BARON,I take five hundred.
26022,m78,grand hotel,L253990,u1191,KRINGELEIN,I do drink Baron -- I drink to you Baron and to win.  It's good -- come along Baron.
26023,m78,grand hotel,L253989,u1184,BARON,Drink to me Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
26024,m78,grand hotel,L253988,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Pardon me Baron. Permit me again... 
26025,m78,grand hotel,L253987,u1184,BARON,I've no luck.
26026,m78,grand hotel,L253986,u1191,KRINGELEIN,You've lost everything?
26027,m78,grand hotel,L253985,u1184,BARON,That was my last.
26028,m78,grand hotel,L253974,u1184,BARON,All right then.
26029,m78,grand hotel,L253973,u1191,KRINGELEIN,All right then.
26030,m78,grand hotel,L253972,u1184,BARON,No -- not at all.
26031,m78,grand hotel,L253971,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Is that too much Baron?
26032,m78,grand hotel,L253967,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Ready Baron.
26033,m78,grand hotel,L253966,u1184,BARON,Ready Kringelein?
26034,m78,grand hotel,L253963,u1184,BARON,Good!
26035,m78,grand hotel,L253962,u1191,KRINGELEIN,We could come to my room.
26036,m78,grand hotel,L253961,u1184,BARON,If we could scare up some men to play.
26037,m78,grand hotel,L253960,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
26038,m78,grand hotel,L253959,u1184,BARON,If I could get into a game I might win some.
26039,m78,grand hotel,L253958,u1191,KRINGELEIN,I would be awfully glad to oblige you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
26040,m78,grand hotel,L253957,u1184,BARON,What?
26041,m78,grand hotel,L253956,u1191,KRINGELEIN,If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
26042,m78,grand hotel,L253955,u1184,BARON,Absolutely true Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
26043,m78,grand hotel,L253954,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Was the Baron joking or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
26044,m78,grand hotel,L253924,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Broke -- A Baron? But Baron --
26045,m78,grand hotel,L253923,u1184,BARON,I'd like to Kringelein but I can't -- I am broke!
26046,m78,grand hotel,L253922,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Perhaps this evening Baron we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
26047,m78,grand hotel,L253921,u1184,BARON,No Kringelein not tired -- just --  Well -- well --
26048,m78,grand hotel,L253920,u1191,KRINGELEIN,The Baron is tired?
26049,m78,grand hotel,L253807,u1184,BARON,No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
26050,m78,grand hotel,L253806,u1191,KRINGELEIN,A drink Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
26051,m78,grand hotel,L253803,u1191,KRINGELEIN,A little strange Baron.
26052,m78,grand hotel,L253802,u1184,BARON,Hello Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
26053,m78,grand hotel,L253801,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Oh -- here you are Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
26054,m78,grand hotel,L253800,u1184,BARON,Hello -- sorry I'm late.
26055,m78,grand hotel,L253720,u1184,BARON,Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
26056,m78,grand hotel,L253719,u1191,KRINGELEIN,In the Yellow Room where the music's playing and the ladies are?
26057,m78,grand hotel,L253718,u1184,BARON,I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
26058,m78,grand hotel,L253715,u1191,KRINGELEIN,We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane.
26059,m78,grand hotel,L253714,u1184,BARON,Yes quite.
26060,m78,grand hotel,L253713,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Baron we must have gone a hundred miles an hour at least...
26061,m78,grand hotel,L253340,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
26062,m78,grand hotel,L253339,u1184,BARON,Then you know him?
26063,m78,grand hotel,L253338,u1191,KRINGELEIN,General Director Preysing!  Baron when I was sixteen years old I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
26064,m78,grand hotel,L253337,u1184,BARON,What's the matter Mr. Kringelein?
26065,m78,grand hotel,L253203,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
26066,m78,grand hotel,L253202,u1184,BARON,And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
26067,m78,grand hotel,L253201,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Oh a Baron! 
26068,m78,grand hotel,L253200,u1184,BARON,I'm Baron von Gaigern.
26069,m78,grand hotel,L253199,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
26070,m78,grand hotel,L253198,u1184,BARON,Not at all sir. 
26071,m78,grand hotel,L253197,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Thank you sir.
26073,m78,grand hotel,L253344,u1184,BARON,Perhaps you could present me now Mr. Pimenov.
26074,m78,grand hotel,L253172,u1184,BARON,Yes I was in the war.
26076,m78,grand hotel,L253170,u1184,BARON,Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
26078,m78,grand hotel,L253168,u1184,BARON,The war.
26080,m78,grand hotel,L253144,u1184,BARON,My dear sir I would gladly change rooms with you.
26082,m78,grand hotel,L253142,u1184,BARON,It's always so quiet here.
26084,m78,grand hotel,L253137,u1184,BARON,I thought she was splendid!
26086,m78,grand hotel,L253135,u1184,BARON,Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
26088,m78,grand hotel,L253133,u1184,BARON,How's the beautiful lady?
26090,m78,grand hotel,L253131,u1184,BARON,Good evening Mr. Pimenov.
26092,m78,grand hotel,L254086,u1184,BARON,Don't do that. 
26093,m78,grand hotel,L254085,u1195,PREYSING,Hello! Hello! --
26094,m78,grand hotel,L254083,u1195,PREYSING,I'm going to call the police. I'm going to watch you play the great Baron with the police. Aristocrat! Aristocrat! 
26095,m78,grand hotel,L254082,u1184,BARON,Be quiet.
26096,m78,grand hotel,L254081,u1195,PREYSING,Indeed you must Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm but you must go to jail Baron you're a thief.
26097,m78,grand hotel,L254080,u1184,BARON,Look here sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
26098,m78,grand hotel,L254079,u1195,PREYSING,So that's how we stand Baron.
26099,m78,grand hotel,L254078,u1195,PREYSING,Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay here... Give me that money.
26100,m78,grand hotel,L254077,u1184,BARON,I must have made a mistake.
26101,m78,grand hotel,L254076,u1195,PREYSING,Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
26102,m78,grand hotel,L253863,u1184,BARON,As you will.
26103,m78,grand hotel,L253862,u1195,PREYSING,We shall see who remains here the longer.
26104,m78,grand hotel,L253861,u1184,BARON,I think it would be much better if you went away.
26105,m78,grand hotel,L253860,u1195,PREYSING,I did not ask your advice.
26106,m78,grand hotel,L253859,u1184,BARON,Oh let the poor devil alone.
26107,m78,grand hotel,L253845,u1195,PREYSING,Insolent -- Berlin manners.
26108,m78,grand hotel,L253844,u1184,BARON,Pardon me the lady has urgent business here with me.
26143,m78,grand hotel,L254045,u1191,KRINGELEIN,No.
26145,m78,grand hotel,L254036,u1191,KRINGELEIN,No -- I must find it --  Fourteen thousand two hundred marks. 
26147,m78,grand hotel,L254034,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Oh I've got to find it.
26149,m78,grand hotel,L254031,u1191,KRINGELEIN,More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
26151,m78,grand hotel,L254024,u1191,KRINGELEIN,I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
26153,m78,grand hotel,L254022,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh the pain.
26155,m78,grand hotel,L253983,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Excuse me gentlemen.
26157,m78,grand hotel,L253824,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Everything?
26159,m78,grand hotel,L253822,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
26161,m78,grand hotel,L253820,u1191,KRINGELEIN,I had a very good opportunity a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance it seems to be very important.

26165,m78,grand hotel,L253785,u1191,KRINGELEIN,For me? -- Oh please something sweet and cold.
26167,m78,grand hotel,L253722,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Pain? Oh no Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
26169,m78,grand hotel,L253717,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Yes thanks to the Baron. The best shops the very best. Look Doctor silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat see -- made in England that's silk too -- fifty marks... Look the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
26171,m78,grand hotel,L253546,u1191,KRINGELEIN,But Doctor --

26178,m78,grand hotel,L253205,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes --

26183,m78,grand hotel,L253188,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Oh -- but -- I --
26185,m78,grand hotel,L253186,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Oh!
26187,m78,grand hotel,L253184,u1191,KRINGELEIN,I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang... 
26188,m78,grand hotel,L254213,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Oh there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
26189,m78,grand hotel,L254212,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
26190,m78,grand hotel,L254209,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
26191,m78,grand hotel,L254208,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Am I!
26192,m78,grand hotel,L254175,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,You're a good man Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
26193,m78,grand hotel,L254174,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Do you like me better?
26194,m78,grand hotel,L254173,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Oh yes of course.
26195,m78,grand hotel,L254172,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
26196,m78,grand hotel,L254171,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
26197,m78,grand hotel,L254170,u1191,KRINGELEIN,When I -- I'm ill Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
26198,m78,grand hotel,L254169,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Later?
26199,m78,grand hotel,L254168,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
26200,m78,grand hotel,L254167,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
26201,m78,grand hotel,L254166,u1191,KRINGELEIN,You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
26202,m78,grand hotel,L254165,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,What?
26203,m78,grand hotel,L254164,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
26204,m78,grand hotel,L254163,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,You don't understand that do you?
26205,m78,grand hotel,L254162,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Yes of course -- money!
26206,m78,grand hotel,L254161,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Money!
26207,m78,grand hotel,L254160,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Then why did you have anything to do with him?
26208,m78,grand hotel,L254159,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,I didn't like Preysing right off.
26209,m78,grand hotel,L254158,u1191,KRINGELEIN,He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
26210,m78,grand hotel,L254157,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
26211,m78,grand hotel,L254156,u1191,KRINGELEIN,So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
26212,m78,grand hotel,L254155,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Yes --
26213,m78,grand hotel,L254154,u1191,KRINGELEIN,You loved the Baron didn't you?
26214,m78,grand hotel,L254153,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there his eyes so open.
26215,m78,grand hotel,L254152,u1191,KRINGELEIN,What's the matter?
26216,m78,grand hotel,L254096,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Preysing?
26217,m78,grand hotel,L254095,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once -- Mr. Preysing --

26230,m78,grand hotel,L253864,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,You must look at my face and not at the floor.
26231,m78,grand hotel,L253809,u1191,KRINGELEIN,She's beautiful -- isn't she?
26232,m78,grand hotel,L253808,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Dance then?

26242,m78,grand hotel,L253790,u1191,KRINGELEIN,I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
26243,m78,grand hotel,L253789,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Good evening Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?

26251,m78,grand hotel,L253328,u1191,KRINGELEIN,I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
26252,m78,grand hotel,L253327,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Yes -- and for me it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
26253,m78,grand hotel,L253326,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.

26258,m78,grand hotel,L254072,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do Mr. Preysing! And you said:  'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.
26259,m78,grand hotel,L254071,u1195,PREYSING,You're a funny little creature Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.

26343,m78,grand hotel,L253375,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
26344,m78,grand hotel,L253374,u1195,PREYSING,Moreover... 
26345,m78,grand hotel,L253373,u1188,FLAEMMCHEN,Moreover...

26366,m78,grand hotel,L253758,u1195,PREYSING,Next week.
26368,m78,grand hotel,L253751,u1195,PREYSING,Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
26370,m78,grand hotel,L253749,u1195,PREYSING,I thought we'd suspended negotiations gentlemen.
26372,m78,grand hotel,L253745,u1195,PREYSING,Gentlemen I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
26374,m78,grand hotel,L253743,u1195,PREYSING,Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go it's off. Thank you gentlemen. 
26376,m78,grand hotel,L253741,u1195,PREYSING,Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day but Manchester -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
26379,m78,grand hotel,L253737,u1195,PREYSING,Then it's all over?
26381,m78,grand hotel,L253735,u1195,PREYSING,You've decided against the merger?
26383,m78,grand hotel,L253727,u1195,PREYSING,What?
26385,m78,grand hotel,L253725,u1195,PREYSING,Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
26387,m78,grand hotel,L253613,u1195,PREYSING,I know you did -- I said you did --
26389,m78,grand hotel,L253600,u1195,PREYSING,Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
26391,m78,grand hotel,L253596,u1195,PREYSING,We did not approach you.
26393,m78,grand hotel,L253594,u1195,PREYSING,Now to proceed with the projected merger the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
26395,m78,grand hotel,L253590,u1195,PREYSING,No water -- What a place!
26397,m78,grand hotel,L253588,u1195,PREYSING,I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz before I commit myself.
26399,m78,grand hotel,L253584,u1195,PREYSING,I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital plant and machinery raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
26401,m78,grand hotel,L253582,u1195,PREYSING,Since on the eleventh of June this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
26403,m78,grand hotel,L253580,u1195,PREYSING,We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
26405,m78,grand hotel,L253578,u1195,PREYSING,We have a good many connections in England naturally.
26407,m78,grand hotel,L253574,u1195,PREYSING,Manchester -- yes. Yes yes they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?
26409,m78,grand hotel,L253572,u1195,PREYSING,What?
26430,m78,grand hotel,L254178,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
26432,m78,grand hotel,L254124,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Goodnight Suzette.
26434,m78,grand hotel,L254122,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh think Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest Suzette.
26436,m78,grand hotel,L254120,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
26439,m78,grand hotel,L253655,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Five minutes Suzette come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
26441,m78,grand hotel,L253653,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Oh yes Suzette.
26444,m78,grand hotel,L253650,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Good morning Suzette.
26445,m78,grand hotel,L253317,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,All right Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
26447,m78,grand hotel,L253297,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Send it away -- I shan't need it.
26449,m78,grand hotel,L253295,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Oh Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
26451,m78,grand hotel,L253293,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
26453,m78,grand hotel,L253290,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
26455,m78,grand hotel,L253288,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Let us cancel the engagement.
26457,m78,grand hotel,L253286,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,I can't dance tonight --
26459,m78,grand hotel,L253284,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think Suzette I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
26460,m78,grand hotel,L254199,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
26462,m78,grand hotel,L254197,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Oh the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
26463,m78,grand hotel,L254187,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
26466,m78,grand hotel,L253466,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,I wish to be alone.
26469,m78,grand hotel,L253351,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Hurry Suzette.
26471,m78,grand hotel,L253349,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Take them back Suzette.
26473,m78,grand hotel,L253347,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
26474,m78,grand hotel,L253315,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Oh -- but it can't be.
26476,m78,grand hotel,L253313,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,The house is not full -- Is it really full?
26479,m78,grand hotel,L253310,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,I'm cancelling the engagement.
26481,m78,grand hotel,L254180,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,But when did he go? How do you know?
26483,m78,grand hotel,L253698,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Yes Pimenov.  One minute Suzette I will call you.
26486,m78,grand hotel,L253694,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Good morning Pimenov.
26487,m78,grand hotel,L253307,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and...  ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished.
26489,m78,grand hotel,L253305,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,Last night?... There was no applause.
26491,m78,grand hotel,L253303,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
26492,m78,grand hotel,L253301,u1190,GRUSINSKAYA,The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
26495,m78,grand hotel,L253210,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Again?
26497,m78,grand hotel,L253195,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Well now that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
26499,m78,grand hotel,L253193,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
26501,m78,grand hotel,L254115,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Don't worry about me Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
26502,m78,grand hotel,L254114,u1195,PREYSING,How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
26503,m78,grand hotel,L254113,u1191,KRINGELEIN,We must call the police your excellency.
26504,m78,grand hotel,L254112,u1195,PREYSING,The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
26505,m78,grand hotel,L254111,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Yes I know them --
26506,m78,grand hotel,L254110,u1195,PREYSING,I can answer for this it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters you know them?
26507,m78,grand hotel,L254109,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Her room -- oh -- I see Mr. Preysing -- I understand Mr. General Director Preysing.
26508,m78,grand hotel,L254108,u1195,PREYSING,Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
26509,m78,grand hotel,L254107,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Oh no -- no -- not the Baron.
26510,m78,grand hotel,L254106,u1195,PREYSING,No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
26511,m78,grand hotel,L254105,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Yes the police must be called.
26512,m78,grand hotel,L254104,u1195,PREYSING,-- We must do something...
26513,m78,grand hotel,L254103,u1191,KRINGELEIN,My best friend -- poor Baron -- dead -- just like that.
26514,m78,grand hotel,L254102,u1195,PREYSING,He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
26515,m78,grand hotel,L254101,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
26516,m78,grand hotel,L253887,u1195,PREYSING,Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.
26517,m78,grand hotel,L253886,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Me?
26518,m78,grand hotel,L253885,u1195,PREYSING,You're discharged.
26519,m78,grand hotel,L253884,u1191,KRINGELEIN,An embezzler -- you're going to take that back right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt if I'm dirt you're a lot dirtier Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
26520,m78,grand hotel,L253883,u1195,PREYSING,Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
26521,m78,grand hotel,L253880,u1195,PREYSING,Go away -- go away.
26522,m78,grand hotel,L253879,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior but you're quite an ordinary man.
26523,m78,grand hotel,L253878,u1195,PREYSING,What is this insolence?
26524,m78,grand hotel,L253877,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Does the world belong to you Mr. Preysing?
26525,m78,grand hotel,L253876,u1195,PREYSING,You may go Mr. Kringelein.
26526,m78,grand hotel,L253875,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Some champagne Miss Flaemm?
26527,m78,grand hotel,L253874,u1195,PREYSING,Well now Miss Flaemm we can talk.
26528,m78,grand hotel,L253856,u1195,PREYSING,You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf and here you are in Berlin indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary Mr. Kringelein I think we will look into your books.
26529,m78,grand hotel,L253855,u1191,KRINGELEIN,I could not think of not accepting.
26530,m78,grand hotel,L253854,u1195,PREYSING,Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
26531,m78,grand hotel,L253848,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper building C room twenty-three -- third floor.
26532,m78,grand hotel,L253847,u1195,PREYSING,I don't know you.
26533,m78,grand hotel,L253846,u1191,KRINGELEIN,I wish you a very good evening Mr. Preysing. You are staying here too Mr. Preysing?
26534,m78,grand hotel,L253183,u1191,KRINGELEIN,I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
26536,m78,grand hotel,L253179,u1191,KRINGELEIN,No I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
26538,m78,grand hotel,L253177,u1191,KRINGELEIN,Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
26540,m78,grand hotel,L253175,u1191,KRINGELEIN,I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
26554,m78,grand hotel,L253780,u1195,PREYSING,Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
26556,m78,grand hotel,L253778,u1195,PREYSING,Zinnowitz would you say she was pretty?
26558,m78,grand hotel,L253776,u1195,PREYSING,I want to see her I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
26560,m78,grand hotel,L253774,u1195,PREYSING,Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
26562,m78,grand hotel,L253772,u1195,PREYSING,Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
26564,m78,grand hotel,L253770,u1195,PREYSING,Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
26566,m78,grand hotel,L253768,u1195,PREYSING,No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
26567,m78,grand hotel,L253766,u1195,PREYSING,That.
26569,m78,grand hotel,L253764,u1195,PREYSING,Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.

26574,m78,grand hotel,L253607,u1195,PREYSING,I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
26576,m78,grand hotel,L253603,u1195,PREYSING,Oh here you are Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
26578,m78,grand hotel,L253360,u1195,PREYSING,Good night.
26580,m78,grand hotel,L253358,u1195,PREYSING,I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
26582,m78,grand hotel,L253356,u1195,PREYSING,Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
26584,m78,grand hotel,L253354,u1195,PREYSING,No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
26586,m78,grand hotel,L253155,u1195,PREYSING,I know -- I know.

27206,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267926,u1240,HAROLD,The educational process.
27207,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267925,u1241,LOOSELEAF,I dunno boy.

27349,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268250,u1240,HAROLD,I'm talking to you gently now.
27350,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268249,u1243,PAUL,I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
27351,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268241,u1240,HAROLD,Everybody simply evaporates!  There are guest issues to be fought out here--or to be argued at least. The enemy the champion of all who oppose me is in East St. Louis with his mother and his aunt!  I have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin.
27352,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268240,u1243,PAUL,It's your house Dad.
27353,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268239,u1240,HAROLD,Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
27354,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268238,u1243,PAUL,I don't want to fight you.
27355,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268237,u1240,HAROLD,Then speak by God!  Can you fight with words?
27356,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268219,u1240,HAROLD,Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me are you?  Protect her!`
27357,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268218,u1243,PAUL,Dad--
27358,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268217,u1240,HAROLD,Welcome to manhood you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
27359,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268216,u1243,PAUL,Gee whiz Dad--
27360,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268215,u1240,HAROLD,Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
27361,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268214,u1240,HAROLD,That's a cartridge if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder bullet cartridge case and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
27362,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268213,u1240,HAROLD,Open the bolt!
27363,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268212,u1243,PAUL,No.
27364,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268211,u1240,HAROLD,Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
27365,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268210,u1243,PAUL,No.
27366,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268209,u1240,HAROLD,That's a rifle you have?
27367,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268208,u1243,PAUL,Nothing.
27368,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268207,u1240,HAROLD,What's this?
27369,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268206,u1240,HAROLD,What's this?
27370,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268205,u1243,PAUL,Mom?
27371,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268088,u1243,PAUL,It's Mom.
27372,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268087,u1240,HAROLD,Who was it?
27373,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268086,u1243,PAUL,Dad?
27374,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268055,u1240,HAROLD,You're free to go to her if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women just say the word.
27375,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268054,u1243,PAUL,No.
27376,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268053,u1240,HAROLD,We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
27377,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268052,u1243,PAUL,I'm a man.
27378,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267913,u1240,HAROLD,Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
27379,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267912,u1243,PAUL,What kind of exercise?
27380,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267862,u1240,HAROLD,Leave a tip.
27381,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267861,u1243,PAUL,A hundred dollars for breakfast?
27382,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267860,u1240,HAROLD,Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
27383,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267859,u1243,PAUL,Dad--
27384,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267844,u1240,HAROLD,Make it fast.
27385,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267843,u1243,PAUL,Can I get dressed first?
27386,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267842,u1240,HAROLD,The smallest thing I've got.
27387,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267841,u1243,PAUL,A hundred dollars!
27388,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267838,u1240,HAROLD,Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
27389,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267837,u1243,PAUL,Play?
27390,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267755,u1243,PAUL,Mom?
27391,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267754,u1240,HAROLD,Damn.
27392,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267753,u1243,PAUL,Dad's got jungle fever Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
27393,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267748,u1240,HAROLD,Scat!
27394,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267747,u1243,PAUL,Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up I've got double-decker bunks.
27395,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267746,u1240,HAROLD,Will you go to bed?
27396,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267745,u1243,PAUL,She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society and they got her.
27397,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267744,u1240,HAROLD,Penelope!
27398,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267743,u1243,PAUL,She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
27399,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267742,u1240,HAROLD,Penelope!
27400,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267741,u1243,PAUL,Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway she's dead.
27401,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267740,u1240,HAROLD,That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep and then you thank her in the morning.
27402,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267738,u1240,HAROLD,Can't it keep till morning?
27403,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267737,u1240,HAROLD,Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
27404,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267736,u1243,PAUL,I can't take my eyes off you.
27405,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267735,u1240,HAROLD,Why don't you go to bed--son.
27406,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267734,u1243,PAUL,She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
27407,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267733,u1240,HAROLD,Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
27408,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267732,u1243,PAUL,Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
27409,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267731,u1240,HAROLD,Wants to fix up her makeup no doubt.
27410,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267683,u1243,PAUL,Sir?
27411,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267682,u1240,HAROLD,Yes wife it is.  Come here boy.  Your father is home.
27412,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267630,u1243,PAUL,Go ahead.  No no no no.
27413,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267629,u1240,HAROLD,I'd like to use the sanitary facilities if I may.
27414,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267628,u1243,PAUL,No no no no no.
27415,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267627,u1240,HAROLD,You're a very good boy to respond that way.
27416,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267626,u1243,PAUL,Oh no no no no no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
27417,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267625,u1240,HAROLD,He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
27418,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267624,u1243,PAUL,They're not engaged.
27419,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267623,u1240,HAROLD,Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
27420,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267622,u1243,PAUL,Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war everybody goes but football players.
27421,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267621,u1240,HAROLD,You're supposed to get hurt!
27422,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267620,u1243,PAUL,I wanted to go out for football but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
27423,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267619,u1240,HAROLD,The Germans shot everybody who lived there then leveled it plowed it planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
27424,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267618,u1243,PAUL,Sir?
27425,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267617,u1240,HAROLD,It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
27426,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267616,u1243,PAUL,When I grow up I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
27427,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267615,u1240,HAROLD,The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
27428,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267614,u1243,PAUL,Mhravitch.
27429,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267613,u1240,HAROLD,Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
27430,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267610,u1240,HAROLD,We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
27431,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267609,u1243,PAUL,Where did you get the poison?
27432,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267608,u1240,HAROLD,We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate we stole into the back of the inn and with the permission of the management we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
27433,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267607,u1243,PAUL,Go on.
27434,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267606,u1240,HAROLD,The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
27435,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267605,u1243,PAUL,I don't know.
27436,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267604,u1240,HAROLD,Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
27437,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267603,u1243,PAUL,Uck.
27438,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267602,u1240,HAROLD,We came up behind a sentry and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
27439,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267601,u1243,PAUL,Mhravitch.
27440,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267600,u1240,HAROLD,We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
27441,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267599,u1243,PAUL,Wow.
27442,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267598,u1240,HAROLD,Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day your father and I peering through field glasses saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
27443,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267597,u1243,PAUL,Tell me that!  Tell me that!
27444,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267596,u1240,HAROLD,I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald the Beast of Yugoslavia hand to hand.
27445,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267595,u1243,PAUL,Tell me that.
27446,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267594,u1240,HAROLD,Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
27447,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267589,u1243,PAUL,Dad was never in England?
27448,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267588,u1240,HAROLD,Oh hell.
27449,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267587,u1243,PAUL,England?
27450,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267585,u1243,PAUL,Tell me some true stories about Dad.
27451,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267584,u1240,HAROLD,Big ones little ones teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
27452,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267583,u1243,PAUL,He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
27453,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267582,u1240,HAROLD,Aha!  He has a brilliant military record I'm sure.
27454,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267581,u1243,PAUL,Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
27455,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267580,u1240,HAROLD,What does he do--of an athletic nature?
27456,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267578,u1240,HAROLD,No.
27457,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267577,u1243,PAUL,He doesn't do it in front of me but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
27458,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267576,u1240,HAROLD,It makes life spicy.
27459,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267575,u1243,PAUL,What's good about that?
27460,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267574,u1240,HAROLD,Excellent!
27461,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267573,u1243,PAUL,He insults him all the time.
27462,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267572,u1240,HAROLD,What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father too?
27463,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267571,u1243,PAUL,She has a master's degree in English literature.
27464,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267570,u1240,HAROLD,College?
27465,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267569,u1243,PAUL,They were in the same creative writing class.
27466,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267568,u1240,HAROLD,College!
27467,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267567,u1243,PAUL,She met him at college.
27468,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267566,u1240,HAROLD,I see.  And he came into the apartment one day to demonstrate his wares and your mother as it happened was charmingly en deshabille--
27469,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267565,u1243,PAUL,He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
27470,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267564,u1240,HAROLD,Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
27471,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267563,u1243,PAUL,He worships Father.
27472,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267561,u1243,PAUL,Everybody says he was so brave.
27473,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267560,u1240,HAROLD,Man and boy.
27474,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267559,u1243,PAUL,I was going to a funny movie but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
27475,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267558,u1240,HAROLD,And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
27476,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267557,u1243,PAUL,I'll see.
27477,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267556,u1240,HAROLD,You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
27478,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267555,u1243,PAUL,She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle I guess.
27479,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267554,u1240,HAROLD,You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
27480,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267553,u1243,PAUL,Where's Mom?
27481,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267552,u1240,HAROLD,The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
27482,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267551,u1243,PAUL,Is anybody besides you here now?
27483,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267550,u1240,HAROLD,Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
27484,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267549,u1243,PAUL,Dr. Woodly.
27485,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267548,u1240,HAROLD,Mind?  God yes I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
27486,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267547,u1243,PAUL,Do you mind if I ask who you are?
27487,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267546,u1240,HAROLD,Life has denied me that thrill.
27488,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267545,u1243,PAUL,Do you know who Wanda June is?
27489,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267544,u1240,HAROLD,Ask it!
27490,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267543,u1243,PAUL,Are you--do you--
27491,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267542,u1240,HAROLD,You were about to ask a question?
27492,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267541,u1243,PAUL,Are you--
27493,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267540,u1240,HAROLD,Hello.
27494,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267539,u1243,PAUL,Hello.
27495,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267538,u1240,HAROLD,As a matter of fact--I am home.
27496,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267537,u1243,PAUL,Sir?
27497,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267536,u1240,HAROLD,As a matter of fact--
27498,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267535,u1243,PAUL,Anybody home?
27499,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268318,u1244,PENELOPE,Do it Norbert.
27500,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268317,u1240,HAROLD,Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
27501,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268316,u1244,PENELOPE,Norbert--you come too.  Let him go Harold.  Let him go.
27502,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268315,u1240,HAROLD,Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You too!
27503,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268314,u1244,PENELOPE,You've killed women?
27504,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268313,u1240,HAROLD,Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here or I might kill you.  Who knows?
27505,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268309,u1244,PENELOPE,Out!
27506,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268308,u1240,HAROLD,She's right Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
27507,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268305,u1244,PENELOPE,Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool you fool.
27508,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268304,u1240,HAROLD,The National Safety Council would be appalled.
27509,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268303,u1244,PENELOPE,All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
27510,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268300,u1240,HAROLD,Load it for her.
27511,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268299,u1244,PENELOPE,How do I load?
27512,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268298,u1244,PENELOPE,There it is.  Give it to me.
27513,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268297,u1240,HAROLD,Help your mother find the bullet.
27514,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268296,u1244,PENELOPE,Where's the bullet?
27515,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268295,u1240,HAROLD,Then you'd better fix your bayonet because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
27516,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268294,u1244,PENELOPE,I mean it!
27517,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268293,u1240,HAROLD,Whoever has the gun you see gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
27518,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268292,u1244,PENELOPE,I want you to get out of here Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
27519,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268291,u1240,HAROLD,Ah!  The lady is armed.
27520,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268290,u1244,PENELOPE,I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
27521,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268281,u1240,HAROLD,There has to be a threat of some sort nobility of some sort glamour of some sort sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
27522,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268280,u1244,PENELOPE,No we won't.  No matter how it begins it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends Harold--in death?
27523,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268271,u1240,HAROLD,Stop!
27524,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268270,u1244,PENELOPE,This is suicide.  Go get the police.
27525,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268263,u1240,HAROLD,Don't!
27526,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268262,u1244,PENELOPE,I'm going to call the police.
27527,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268248,u1240,HAROLD,You hope this too?
27528,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268247,u1244,PENELOPE,I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
27529,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268246,u1240,HAROLD,And my son the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher too?
27530,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268245,u1240,HAROLD,No.
27531,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268244,u1244,PENELOPE,No.
27532,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268243,u1240,HAROLD,I feel mocked insulted with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape you know who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
27533,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268242,u1244,PENELOPE,The old heroes are going to have to get used to this Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle no point to battle anymore.
27534,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268235,u1240,HAROLD,May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
27535,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268234,u1244,PENELOPE,It's still just death the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you though it's the honor that crowns them all.
27536,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268233,u1240,HAROLD,If you've lived a good life fought well--
27537,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268232,u1244,PENELOPE,But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals one by one you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
27538,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268231,u1240,HAROLD,What a handsome word.
27539,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268230,u1244,PENELOPE,Honor I suppose.
27540,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268229,u1240,HAROLD,If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
27541,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268228,u1244,PENELOPE,No you don't.
27542,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268227,u1240,HAROLD,I plan to live one hundred years!
27543,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268226,u1244,PENELOPE,So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
27544,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268225,u1240,HAROLD,I'm teaching my son to be a man.
27545,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268224,u1244,PENELOPE,That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
27546,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268223,u1240,HAROLD,If he thinks he's man enough.
27547,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268222,u1244,PENELOPE,You're begging him to kill you?
27548,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268221,u1240,HAROLD,With an iron penis three feet long. Load it boy.
27549,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268220,u1244,PENELOPE,He's a child!
27550,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268204,u1240,HAROLD,Action!  Interaction!  Give and take!  Challenge and response!
27551,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268203,u1244,PENELOPE,Like what?
27552,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268202,u1240,HAROLD,Beautiful you say?  It wasn't life it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness when there could have been so much!
27553,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268201,u1244,PENELOPE,Sounds quite beautiful.
27554,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268199,u1244,PENELOPE,Blue soup?
27555,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268198,u1240,HAROLD,What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
27556,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268197,u1244,PENELOPE,It seems highly intelligent to me.
27557,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268196,u1240,HAROLD,And you a supposedly healthy woman do not detest him for his cowardice?
27558,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268195,u1244,PENELOPE,He's afraid of you Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
27559,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268194,u1240,HAROLD,Last I heard his mother was going alone.
27560,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268193,u1244,PENELOPE,He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
27561,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268192,u1240,HAROLD,I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
27562,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268191,u1244,PENELOPE,Rifle?
27563,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268190,u1240,HAROLD,He'll play with his rifle I expect. That will cheer him up.
27564,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268189,u1244,PENELOPE,How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
27565,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268188,u1240,HAROLD,See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
27566,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268186,u1244,PENELOPE,I see.
27567,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268185,u1240,HAROLD,Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing I know.
27568,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268183,u1244,PENELOPE,I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
27569,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268182,u1240,HAROLD,Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
27570,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268181,u1244,PENELOPE,Just one favor.
27571,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268180,u1240,HAROLD,Goodbye goodbye goodbye.
27572,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268179,u1244,PENELOPE,Almost a Christmas scene.
27573,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268178,u1240,HAROLD,Well--what have we here?  A family.
27574,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268122,u1244,PENELOPE,You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
27575,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268121,u1240,HAROLD,Things.
27576,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268112,u1240,HAROLD,Hope.
27577,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268111,u1244,PENELOPE,He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
27578,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268110,u1240,HAROLD,He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
27579,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268109,u1244,PENELOPE,Two hundred years old.
27580,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268108,u1240,HAROLD,About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
27581,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268107,u1244,PENELOPE,He cried.
27582,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268106,u1240,HAROLD,I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing but in the owner's reactions.
27583,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268105,u1244,PENELOPE,He knows you shattered his violin.
27584,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268104,u1240,HAROLD,More nerve than the doctor I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
27585,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268103,u1244,PENELOPE,Unless she has nerve.
27586,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268102,u1240,HAROLD,It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan and then comes back--for anything.
27587,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268101,u1244,PENELOPE,Did you like it dear?
27588,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268100,u1240,HAROLD,It's a big and busy funeral home.
27589,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268099,u1244,PENELOPE,A dozen?
27590,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268098,u1240,HAROLD,He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
27591,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268097,u1244,PENELOPE,You took him to the funeral I hear.
27592,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268096,u1240,HAROLD,If he wants to go.
27593,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268095,u1244,PENELOPE,I came for Paul as well.
27594,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268094,u1240,HAROLD,Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
27595,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268093,u1244,PENELOPE,I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile worthless organism to use.
27596,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268092,u1240,HAROLD,Sneaking in the back door.
27597,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268091,u1244,PENELOPE,I came for my clothes.
27598,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267984,u1244,PENELOPE,Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
27599,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267983,u1240,HAROLD,Why not?
27600,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267982,u1244,PENELOPE,No you're not!
27601,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267981,u1240,HAROLD,He did his best to destroy my most precious possession which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
27602,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267980,u1244,PENELOPE,What are you going to do?
27603,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267979,u1240,HAROLD,That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
27604,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267978,u1244,PENELOPE,I don't think so.
27605,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267977,u1240,HAROLD,And no one's there now?
27606,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267976,u1244,PENELOPE,Yes.
27607,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267975,u1240,HAROLD,And he keeps it in his apartment?
27608,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267974,u1244,PENELOPE,His most cherished possession?  His violin I guess.
27609,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267973,u1240,HAROLD,And what is his most cherished possession?
27610,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267972,u1244,PENELOPE,Yes.
27611,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267971,u1240,HAROLD,The doctor.
27612,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267970,u1244,PENELOPE,I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
27613,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267969,u1240,HAROLD,You learned this in some college course?
27614,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267968,u1244,PENELOPE,And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them as you say--  for revenge.
27615,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267967,u1240,HAROLD,Go on.
27616,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267966,u1244,PENELOPE,Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long and make awful messes while they're there.
27617,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267965,u1240,HAROLD,I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
27618,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267964,u1244,PENELOPE,It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
27619,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267963,u1240,HAROLD,Tell me about its sexual roots.
27620,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267962,u1244,PENELOPE,The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
27621,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267961,u1240,HAROLD,Such as?...
27622,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267960,u1244,PENELOPE,Well I can.  Some injuries spiritual or physical can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
27623,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267959,u1240,HAROLD,Fish can't feel.
27624,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267958,u1244,PENELOPE,I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
27625,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267957,u1240,HAROLD,It couldn't!
27626,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267956,u1244,PENELOPE,I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
27627,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267955,u1240,HAROLD,You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
27628,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267954,u1244,PENELOPE,This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
27629,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267953,u1240,HAROLD,That's what you're supposed to say.
27630,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267952,u1244,PENELOPE,I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word but when I heard it I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
27631,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267951,u1240,HAROLD,What then?
27632,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267950,u1244,PENELOPE,No.
27633,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267949,u1240,HAROLD,Let me guess--breakfast is served?
27634,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267933,u1240,HAROLD,I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?
27635,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267932,u1244,PENELOPE,I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
27636,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267931,u1240,HAROLD,I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?
27637,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267924,u1240,HAROLD,Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
27638,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267923,u1244,PENELOPE,They don't have to feel like slaves.
27639,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267922,u1240,HAROLD,People now have dignity when frying eggs?
27640,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267921,u1244,PENELOPE,You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
27641,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267920,u1240,HAROLD,Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
27642,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267919,u1244,PENELOPE,People don't use that word any more.
27643,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267918,u1240,HAROLD,Cook by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
27644,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267916,u1240,HAROLD,You're a woman aren't you?
27645,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267915,u1244,PENELOPE,We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
27646,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267914,u1240,HAROLD,Chow chow chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
27647,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267911,u1240,HAROLD,Then let me see him go out and get some exercise.  Right now!
27648,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267910,u1244,PENELOPE,You're wrong.
27649,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267909,u1240,HAROLD,Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
27650,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267908,u1244,PENELOPE,What a honeymoon.
27651,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267907,u1240,HAROLD,She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
27652,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267905,u1240,HAROLD,Which one?
27653,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267904,u1244,PENELOPE,That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
27654,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267903,u1240,HAROLD,All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh hell--sit down Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
27655,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267902,u1244,PENELOPE,Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
27656,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267901,u1240,HAROLD,And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
27657,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267900,u1240,HAROLD,Scrambled eggs kippered herring fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
27658,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267899,u1244,PENELOPE,Breakfast?
27659,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267864,u1240,HAROLD,Ram it up your ass!
27660,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267863,u1244,PENELOPE,I have some change!
27661,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267858,u1240,HAROLD,We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
27662,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267857,u1244,PENELOPE,I have a brain.
27663,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267856,u1240,HAROLD,You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
27664,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267855,u1244,PENELOPE,You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
27665,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267854,u1240,HAROLD,I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense so tense.
27666,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267853,u1240,HAROLD,I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around turn around.
27667,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267852,u1244,PENELOPE,Turn around?
27668,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267851,u1240,HAROLD,Now--turn around if you would.
27669,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267849,u1240,HAROLD,I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves!
27670,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267848,u1244,PENELOPE,Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
27671,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267847,u1240,HAROLD,You used to like it stark!
27672,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267846,u1244,PENELOPE,It's so--so stark.
27673,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267845,u1240,HAROLD,Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
27674,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267840,u1240,HAROLD,Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
27675,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267839,u1244,PENELOPE,He hasn't had breakfast yet.
27676,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267836,u1240,HAROLD,I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here.  Go out and play.
27677,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267835,u1244,PENELOPE,A trip you mean?
27678,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267834,u1240,HAROLD,We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
27679,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267833,u1244,PENELOPE,I did?
27680,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267832,u1240,HAROLD,You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
27681,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267831,u1244,PENELOPE,Ghastly cruel unnecessary.
27682,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267830,u1240,HAROLD,Now that's what I call fun.
27683,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267823,u1244,PENELOPE,Do say hello to your mother.
27684,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267822,u1240,HAROLD,Say hello to your mother.
27685,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267821,u1244,PENELOPE,Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
27686,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267818,u1240,HAROLD,He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
27687,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267817,u1244,PENELOPE,He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
27688,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267813,u1240,HAROLD,You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering ingratitude loneliness death--
27689,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267812,u1244,PENELOPE,Please--
27690,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267811,u1240,HAROLD,I could carve a better man out of a banana!
27691,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267810,u1244,PENELOPE,Harold!
27692,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267802,u1240,HAROLD,Have some.
27693,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267801,u1244,PENELOPE,I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared so scared.
27694,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267785,u1244,PENELOPE,Thank God!
27695,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267784,u1240,HAROLD,Nothing would please me more.
27696,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267783,u1244,PENELOPE,You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both respect you both. You should be friends.
27697,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267779,u1240,HAROLD,I was I was.  It never lasts long.
27698,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267778,u1244,PENELOPE,Paul said you were awfully sick.
27699,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267777,u1240,HAROLD,When I'm dead--  or fucking.
27700,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267776,u1244,PENELOPE,Shouldn't you lie down?
27701,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267775,u1240,HAROLD,We all are.
27702,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267774,u1244,PENELOPE,He's a very decent man Harold.
27703,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267773,u1240,HAROLD,I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
27704,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267772,u1244,PENELOPE,We thought it was an emergency.
27705,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267771,u1240,HAROLD,Your old beau?
27706,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267770,u1244,PENELOPE,We thought a doctor might help.
27707,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267769,u1240,HAROLD,What's that all about?
27708,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267761,u1244,PENELOPE,You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
27709,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267760,u1240,HAROLD,Bluh.
27710,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267703,u1244,PENELOPE,Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
27711,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267702,u1240,HAROLD,You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
27712,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267701,u1244,PENELOPE,Well--enjoy the natural honest unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
27713,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267700,u1240,HAROLD,Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural unrehearsed.
27714,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267699,u1244,PENELOPE,A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
27715,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267698,u1240,HAROLD,This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
27716,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267697,u1244,PENELOPE,Situation.
27717,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267696,u1240,HAROLD,Disease?
27718,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267695,u1244,PENELOPE,I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
27719,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267694,u1240,HAROLD,What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
27720,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267693,u1244,PENELOPE,We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul being young can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
27721,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267692,u1240,HAROLD,You were well adjusted to my being dead?
27722,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267691,u1244,PENELOPE,Give us time Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
27723,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267690,u1240,HAROLD,Like hugging a lamp post.
27724,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267689,u1244,PENELOPE,Give us time.
27725,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267688,u1240,HAROLD,What's the matter?
27726,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267674,u1240,HAROLD,I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
27727,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267673,u1244,PENELOPE,Not at all.
27728,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267672,u1240,HAROLD,How do you do Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
27729,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267671,u1244,PENELOPE,How do you do?
27730,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267533,u1240,HAROLD,The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
27731,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267532,u1244,PENELOPE,Some kind of animal?
27732,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267531,u1240,HAROLD,My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
27733,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267530,u1244,PENELOPE,What do you do for a living?
27734,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267529,u1240,HAROLD,Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
27735,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267528,u1244,PENELOPE,This is crazy.
27736,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267527,u1240,HAROLD,You are woman.  I know woman well.
27737,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267526,u1244,PENELOPE,You don't even know me.
27738,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267525,u1240,HAROLD,Daughter--I love you very much.
27739,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267524,u1244,PENELOPE,I'm engaged.
27740,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267523,u1240,HAROLD,Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
27741,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267522,u1244,PENELOPE,I'm sorry sir I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
27742,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267521,u1240,HAROLD,What time do you get off work my child?
27743,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267520,u1244,PENELOPE,Yes sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
27744,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267519,u1240,HAROLD,Raw hamburger please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
27745,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267518,u1244,PENELOPE,Sir?
27746,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267517,u1240,HAROLD,A springbok an oryx a gemsbok--a gazelle.
27747,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267516,u1244,PENELOPE,Eighteen--  and a half.
27748,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267515,u1240,HAROLD,I think so daughter.  How old are you?
27749,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267514,u1244,PENELOPE,Can I help you sir?
27750,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267513,u1244,PENELOPE,Heaven.
27751,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267169,u1240,HAROLD,I am Harold Ryan her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
27752,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267168,u1244,PENELOPE,How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
27753,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268396,u1240,HAROLD,For what it's worth now Harold Ryan the clown gives his sacred word.
27754,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268395,u1248,WOODLY,Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
27755,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268394,u1240,HAROLD,I'll put it in Paul's room where it belongs.
27756,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268393,u1248,WOODLY,Leave the rifle here.
27757,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268392,u1240,HAROLD,Use the sanitary facilities if I may.
27758,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268391,u1248,WOODLY,What are you going to do?
27759,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268390,u1240,HAROLD,Somewhere in this city.  Not here not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer by all means.
27760,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268389,u1248,WOODLY,New lives begin!
27761,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268388,u1240,HAROLD,It's trash now like mine.
27762,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268387,u1248,WOODLY,Thank you--for my life.
27763,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268386,u1248,WOODLY,Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
27764,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268385,u1240,HAROLD,Can't do it.
27765,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268384,u1240,HAROLD,Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
27766,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268383,u1248,WOODLY,No.
27767,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268382,u1240,HAROLD,Get up.
27768,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268381,u1248,WOODLY,No.  No.
27769,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268380,u1240,HAROLD,I've enjoyed being man.
27770,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268379,u1248,WOODLY,Don't shoot.
27771,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268378,u1240,HAROLD,Man as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time it's time.
27772,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268377,u1248,WOODLY,What is this thing that kills me?
27773,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268376,u1240,HAROLD,If you want to be found that way.
27774,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268375,u1248,WOODLY,Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
27775,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268374,u1248,WOODLY,Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise they say. You'll like it there.
27776,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268373,u1240,HAROLD,Like the saber-toothed tiger.
27777,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268372,u1248,WOODLY,New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
27778,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268371,u1240,HAROLD,My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
27779,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268370,u1248,WOODLY,No!
27780,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268369,u1240,HAROLD,I'm going to shoot you now.
27781,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268368,u1248,WOODLY,You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
27782,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268367,u1240,HAROLD,We never quit fighting until we're dead.
27783,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268366,u1248,WOODLY,More clowning!  Don't you see?
27784,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268365,u1240,HAROLD,You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
27785,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268364,u1248,WOODLY,I'm utterly satisfied.
27786,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268363,u1240,HAROLD,Here.  Finish the job.
27787,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268362,u1248,WOODLY,Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
27788,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268361,u1240,HAROLD,Was I ever of use?
27789,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268360,u1248,WOODLY,But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you of course.  No more guns no more guns.
27790,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268359,u1240,HAROLD,You're too modest.
27791,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268358,u1248,WOODLY,I hate crowds and I have no charisma--
27792,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268357,u1240,HAROLD,The new hero is you.
27793,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268356,u1248,WOODLY,And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant so preposterously misinformed.
27794,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268355,u1240,HAROLD,Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
27795,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268354,u1248,WOODLY,My violin is avenged!
27796,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268353,u1240,HAROLD,Don Quixote.
27797,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268352,u1248,WOODLY,You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
27798,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268351,u1240,HAROLD,I see.
27799,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268350,u1240,HAROLD,No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years armed with nothing but kindness a talent for languages and a pocketknife.
27800,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268349,u1248,WOODLY,You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
27801,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268348,u1240,HAROLD,I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
27802,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268346,u1240,HAROLD,Poison.
27803,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268344,u1248,WOODLY,I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
27804,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268343,u1240,HAROLD,With spittle?
27805,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268342,u1248,WOODLY,I've struck my blow.
27806,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268341,u1240,HAROLD,Cut me open.  Find out.
27807,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268340,u1248,WOODLY,Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
27808,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268339,u1240,HAROLD,No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
27809,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268338,u1248,WOODLY,In any event I will not beg for mercy.
27810,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268337,u1240,HAROLD,You hope.
27811,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268336,u1248,WOODLY,King Arthur.
27812,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268335,u1240,HAROLD,I'm an honorable clown?
27813,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268334,u1248,WOODLY,You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
27814,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268333,u1240,HAROLD,This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
27815,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268332,u1248,WOODLY,If you're at home in the ooze and nowhere else.
27816,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268331,u1240,HAROLD,I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
27817,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268330,u1248,WOODLY,Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
27818,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268329,u1240,HAROLD,I love you!  Have a cigar!
27819,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268328,u1248,WOODLY,You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
27820,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268327,u1240,HAROLD,Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
27821,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268326,u1248,WOODLY,I'm high as a kite.
27822,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268325,u1240,HAROLD,You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
27823,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268320,u1240,HAROLD,And terror if you don't mind.
27824,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268319,u1248,WOODLY,Hands and knees you say?
27825,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268311,u1240,HAROLD,Comical?
27826,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268310,u1248,WOODLY,I haven't told you Harold how comical I think you are.
27827,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268289,u1240,HAROLD,Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
27828,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268288,u1248,WOODLY,You're a son of a bitch.
27829,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268287,u1240,HAROLD,We do survive don't we?  You're going to have to apologize of course for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
27830,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268286,u1248,WOODLY,A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
27831,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268285,u1240,HAROLD,Now who's being cruel?

28020,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267676,u1243,PAUL,Mom?
28021,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267670,u1244,PENELOPE,For Heaven's sakes!
28022,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267669,u1243,PAUL,Don't know.
28023,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267668,u1244,PENELOPE,What's his name?
28024,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267667,u1243,PAUL,Father's friend.
28025,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267666,u1244,PENELOPE,Then who flushed the toilet?
28026,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267665,u1243,PAUL,No.
28027,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267664,u1244,PENELOPE,Is Norbert still here?
28028,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267640,u1243,PAUL,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
28029,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267639,u1244,PENELOPE,Yes he is.
28030,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267638,u1243,PAUL,What difference does that make?  Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?
28031,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267637,u1244,PENELOPE,Who have you been talking to?
28032,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267636,u1243,PAUL,Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
28033,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267315,u1243,PAUL,Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
28034,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267314,u1244,PENELOPE,Where will you be?
28035,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267211,u1243,PAUL,It's beautiful.
28036,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267210,u1244,PENELOPE,I hate that thing.
28037,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267209,u1243,PAUL,To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace everybody.
28038,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267208,u1244,PENELOPE,I don't really know.
28039,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267207,u1243,PAUL,J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
28040,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267206,u1244,PENELOPE,A lot of people don't.
28041,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267205,u1243,PAUL,I didn't know that.
28042,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267204,u1244,PENELOPE,Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company I suppose.  As far as that goes J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
28043,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267203,u1243,PAUL,I was afraid to ask.
28044,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267202,u1244,PENELOPE,In a railroad accident many years ago.
28045,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267201,u1243,PAUL,How did she lose her feet?
28046,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267200,u1244,PENELOPE,You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother who has no husband who has no money of her own who has no feet?
28047,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267199,u1243,PAUL,Still lives with his mother.
28048,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267198,u1244,PENELOPE,Not true.
28049,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267197,u1243,PAUL,You're the only woman he ever took out.
28050,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267196,u1244,PENELOPE,That's an interesting piece of news.
28051,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267195,u1243,PAUL,A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
28052,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267194,u1244,PENELOPE,A what kind of doctor?
28053,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267193,u1243,PAUL,A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
28054,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267192,u1244,PENELOPE,Thank you kind sir.
28055,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267191,u1243,PAUL,If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
28056,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267190,u1244,PENELOPE,Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
28057,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267189,u1243,PAUL,He's alive!
28058,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267188,u1244,PENELOPE,He's a ghost!
28059,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267187,u1243,PAUL,You're married!  You've already got a husband!
28060,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267186,u1244,PENELOPE,Oh Paul--
28061,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267185,u1243,PAUL,Stay home tonight!
28062,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267184,u1244,PENELOPE,I know.
28063,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267183,u1243,PAUL,Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
28064,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267182,u1244,PENELOPE,I told you this was a simple-minded play.
28065,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267181,u1243,PAUL,He's coming back Mom!  He's the bravest most wonderful man who ever lived.
28066,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267180,u1244,PENELOPE,And this is my son Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
28067,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267721,u1248,WOODLY,No!
28068,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267720,u1243,PAUL,He is my father.
28069,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267719,u1248,WOODLY,He isn't?
28070,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267718,u1243,PAUL,He isn't any friend of Father.
28071,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267717,u1248,WOODLY,I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
28072,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267285,u1248,WOODLY,Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
28073,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267284,u1243,PAUL,It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
28074,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267237,u1243,PAUL,Keeps fairies away!
28075,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267236,u1248,WOODLY,I hate that thing.
28076,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267233,u1248,WOODLY,It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall for the sake of variety.
28077,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267232,u1243,PAUL,It's fine!
28078,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267231,u1248,WOODLY,How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
28079,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267230,u1243,PAUL,Don't worry about it.
28080,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267229,u1248,WOODLY,I apologize.  But you didn't know him and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
28081,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267228,u1243,PAUL,My father!
28082,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267227,u1248,WOODLY,A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
28083,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267226,u1243,PAUL,Everything stays as it is!
28084,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267221,u1248,WOODLY,Oh?
28085,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267220,u1243,PAUL,We don't have a maid any more.
28086,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267214,u1248,WOODLY,You're going out?
28087,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267213,u1243,PAUL,You're taking Mom out tonight?
28088,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267212,u1248,WOODLY,Peace everybody--Paul Penelope.
28089,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268120,u1245,SHUTTLE,He's the most wonderful guy I ever met Penelope.  He's the most complicated guy I ever met.  I can't believe it but he's going to take me to Africa with him.
28090,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268119,u1244,PENELOPE,You and Harold are friends?
28091,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267663,u1245,SHUTTLE,Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
28092,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267662,u1244,PENELOPE,It's true.
28093,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267657,u1245,SHUTTLE,What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
28094,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267656,u1244,PENELOPE,You were wonderful.
28095,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267655,u1245,SHUTTLE,I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it isn't it?  I was too respectful.
28096,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267654,u1244,PENELOPE,I'm saying no--and thank you.
28097,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267653,u1245,SHUTTLE,You're saying no.
28098,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267652,u1244,PENELOPE,Thank you Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
28099,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267651,u1245,SHUTTLE,Marry me instead.
28100,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267650,u1244,PENELOPE,I'm sorry.
28101,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267649,u1245,SHUTTLE,I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
28102,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267648,u1244,PENELOPE,A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
28103,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267647,u1245,SHUTTLE,How long has this been going on?
28104,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267646,u1244,PENELOPE,Possibly.
28105,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267635,u1245,SHUTTLE,We got a birthday cake kid.  Did you see the cake?
28106,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267634,u1244,PENELOPE,What's the matter now?
28107,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267388,u1245,SHUTTLE,He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
28108,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267387,u1244,PENELOPE,What was it?
28109,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267386,u1245,SHUTTLE,He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
28110,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267385,u1244,PENELOPE,We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here Norbert in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
28111,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267384,u1245,SHUTTLE,Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
28112,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267383,u1244,PENELOPE,Did you talk to Paul?
28113,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267379,u1244,PENELOPE,How nice.
28114,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267378,u1245,SHUTTLE,For Harold.  When Paul comes home we can have some birthday cake.
28115,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267377,u1244,PENELOPE,A what?
28116,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267376,u1245,SHUTTLE,Then I saw this bakery store that was still open so I bought a birthday cake.
28117,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267375,u1244,PENELOPE,You figure!
28118,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267374,u1245,SHUTTLE,I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
28119,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267373,u1245,SHUTTLE,It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
28120,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267372,u1244,PENELOPE,The park!
28121,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267371,u1245,SHUTTLE,He ditched me.  He started running and I started running then he lost me in the park.
28122,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267370,u1244,PENELOPE,Is he coming home?
28123,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267369,u1245,SHUTTLE,Far as I know.
28124,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267368,u1244,PENELOPE,Is he all right?
28125,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267367,u1245,SHUTTLE,Yeah.
28126,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267366,u1244,PENELOPE,Did you see him?
28127,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267328,u1245,SHUTTLE,We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
28128,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267327,u1244,PENELOPE,What then?
28129,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267294,u1244,PENELOPE,Seven jaguars' skins I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?
28130,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267293,u1245,SHUTTLE,Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
28131,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267292,u1244,PENELOPE,Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
28132,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267277,u1245,SHUTTLE,Women are always late.  You'll find out.
28133,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267276,u1244,PENELOPE,Coming.
28134,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267267,u1244,PENELOPE,Good night.
28135,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267266,u1245,SHUTTLE,If you'll pardon the expression that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
28136,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267265,u1244,PENELOPE,I see.
28137,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267264,u1245,SHUTTLE,That's when I'll get my confidence back.
28138,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267263,u1244,PENELOPE,I'm touched.
28139,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267262,u1245,SHUTTLE,When Harold is definitely out of the picture Penelope when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
28140,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267261,u1244,PENELOPE,This conversation took place incidentally about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
28141,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267260,u1245,SHUTTLE,Something happens to my confidence.
28142,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267259,u1244,PENELOPE,Yes?
28143,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267257,u1244,PENELOPE,I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
28144,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267256,u1245,SHUTTLE,If you want to wrestle you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis you go to Vanderbilt.
28145,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267255,u1244,PENELOPE,I know.
28146,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267254,u1245,SHUTTLE,I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
28147,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267253,u1244,PENELOPE,I'm glad.
28148,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267252,u1245,SHUTTLE,All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman you know?  I have confidence and I look like I have confidence and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing though when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
28149,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267251,u1244,PENELOPE,That's something I suppose.
28150,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267250,u1245,SHUTTLE,He'd assume we had.
28151,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267249,u1244,PENELOPE,Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong you know.
28152,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267248,u1245,SHUTTLE,He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me too--the kind of guy he is.
28153,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267247,u1244,PENELOPE,Doing what?
28154,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267246,u1245,SHUTTLE,I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
28155,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267244,u1244,PENELOPE,I'll get ready Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
28156,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267243,u1245,SHUTTLE,He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
28157,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267242,u1244,PENELOPE,Please--
28158,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268322,u1248,WOODLY,Goodbye.
28159,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268321,u1244,PENELOPE,Do it!
28160,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268307,u1244,PENELOPE,You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
28161,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268306,u1248,WOODLY,Everything's going to be beautiful.
28162,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268257,u1248,WOODLY,Oh--look at the poor crucified violin would you?
28163,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268256,u1244,PENELOPE,You fool you fool.
28164,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268255,u1248,WOODLY,It's really that bad?
28165,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L268254,u1244,PENELOPE,Get out of here.
28166,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267826,u1248,WOODLY,Thanks.
28167,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267825,u1244,PENELOPE,Tell her to have a nice trip.
28168,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267824,u1248,WOODLY,I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
28169,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267804,u1244,PENELOPE,I believe in miracles now.
28170,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267803,u1248,WOODLY,Thank you.  Thank you very much.
28171,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267709,u1244,PENELOPE,How neat.  How keen.
28172,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267708,u1248,WOODLY,We met here earlier this evening.
28173,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267707,u1244,PENELOPE,You know each other?
28174,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267364,u1244,PENELOPE,He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
28175,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267363,u1248,WOODLY,That's been said before.
28176,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267362,u1244,PENELOPE,It's a jungle out there.
28177,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267360,u1244,PENELOPE,He's not your son.
28178,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267359,u1248,WOODLY,If he is in the park luck is all that can save him now and there's plenty of that.
28179,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267358,u1244,PENELOPE,We've got to rescue him.
28180,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267357,u1248,WOODLY,He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
28181,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267356,u1244,PENELOPE,Paul's only twelve years old.
28182,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267355,u1248,WOODLY,They didn't murder me.
28183,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267354,u1244,PENELOPE,And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
28184,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267353,u1248,WOODLY,Me too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or when I'm in there there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
28185,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267352,u1244,PENELOPE,I'm amazed.
28186,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267351,u1248,WOODLY,To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt you know--since I'm always for peace--
28187,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267350,u1244,PENELOPE,Why would you do that?
28188,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267349,u1248,WOODLY,Every night Penelope for the past two years I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
28189,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267348,u1244,PENELOPE,Meaning?
28190,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267347,u1248,WOODLY,I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
28191,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267346,u1244,PENELOPE,It's suicide!
28192,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267345,u1248,WOODLY,I wish Paul luck.
28193,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267344,u1244,PENELOPE,No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
28194,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267343,u1248,WOODLY,If you warned him against it as much as you say it's almost a certainty.
28195,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267342,u1244,PENELOPE,He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
28196,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267341,u1248,WOODLY,What kind of a life is that?
28197,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267340,u1244,PENELOPE,It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
28198,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267339,u1248,WOODLY,The what?
28199,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267338,u1244,PENELOPE,That's the XKE.
28200,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267337,u1248,WOODLY,We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
28201,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267335,u1248,WOODLY,After this explosion I think he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
28202,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267334,u1244,PENELOPE,As long as he keeps out of the park.
28203,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267333,u1248,WOODLY,The wilder Paul is tonight the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
28204,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267332,u1244,PENELOPE,It is?
28205,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267331,u1248,WOODLY,This is very good for us.
28206,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267323,u1248,WOODLY,Tonight's the night.
28207,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267322,u1244,PENELOPE,I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask or what to say.
28208,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267297,u1248,WOODLY,Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God though Penelope don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you.
28209,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267296,u1244,PENELOPE,What?
28210,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267295,u1248,WOODLY,Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
28211,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267235,u1248,WOODLY,No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
28212,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267225,u1248,WOODLY,Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
28213,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267224,u1244,PENELOPE,They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
28214,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267223,u1248,WOODLY,I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death I want to cry.  I don't cry of course.  Not manly you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
28215,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267222,u1244,PENELOPE,The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
28216,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267219,u1244,PENELOPE,She quit this afternoon.
28217,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267218,u1248,WOODLY,I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma as a matter of fact.
28218,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267217,u1244,PENELOPE,We made the date three months ago.
28219,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267216,u1248,WOODLY,Take plenty of cigars.
28220,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267215,u1244,PENELOPE,Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
28221,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267171,u1244,PENELOPE,Would you like to say something about killing Colonel?
28222,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267170,u1248,WOODLY,I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere or we are doomed.
28223,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267330,u1245,SHUTTLE,Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
28224,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267329,u1248,WOODLY,Minors aren't allowed at fights.
28225,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267326,u1245,SHUTTLE,I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
28226,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267325,u1248,WOODLY,What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
28227,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267324,u1245,SHUTTLE,If he'd just get into scouting and camp out some and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
28228,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267321,u1248,WOODLY,Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
28229,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267320,u1245,SHUTTLE,If he'd just come out for the Little League the way I asked him he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other slug each other and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
28230,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267319,u1248,WOODLY,It's good.  Let him go.
28231,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267318,u1245,SHUTTLE,Kid--kid--
28232,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267291,u1248,WOODLY,You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
28233,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267290,u1245,SHUTTLE,You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
28234,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267289,u1248,WOODLY,He died of a massive rupture.
28235,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267288,u1245,SHUTTLE,You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
28236,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267287,u1248,WOODLY,Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
28237,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267286,u1245,SHUTTLE,Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
28238,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267283,u1245,SHUTTLE,You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
28239,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267282,u1248,WOODLY,Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely moist nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile and that's the end of mankind.
28240,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267281,u1245,SHUTTLE,None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
28241,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267280,u1248,WOODLY,It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
28242,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267279,u1245,SHUTTLE,I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President you support him no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
28243,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267278,u1248,WOODLY,The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
28244,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267275,u1245,SHUTTLE,Penelope!  We're late!
28245,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267274,u1248,WOODLY,We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other eating each other alive.
28246,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267273,u1248,WOODLY,Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
28247,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267272,u1245,SHUTTLE,Phooey.
28248,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267271,u1248,WOODLY,That's not true either--or needn't be unless we make it true.
28249,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267270,u1245,SHUTTLE,Or get eaten alive.
28250,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267269,u1248,WOODLY,Not true.
28251,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267268,u1245,SHUTTLE,You've got to fight from time to time.
28252,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267241,u1248,WOODLY,That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
28253,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267240,u1245,SHUTTLE,Is that a fact?
28254,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267239,u1248,WOODLY,I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
28255,m82,happy birthday wanda june,L267238,u1245,SHUTTLE,Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
31084,m90,his girl friday,L284535,u1364,HILDY,Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
31085,m90,his girl friday,L284533,u1364,HILDY,That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
31087,m90,his girl friday,L284531,u1364,HILDY,Who is it?
31089,m90,his girl friday,L283741,u1364,HILDY,I'm getting married tomorrow.
31091,m90,his girl friday,L283739,u1364,HILDY,No just a farewell appearance batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
31094,m90,his girl friday,L283736,u1364,HILDY,Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
31095,m90,his girl friday,L284568,u1357,BURNS,Bon jour!
31097,m90,his girl friday,L284566,u1357,BURNS,I'll keep you in mind.
31098,m90,his girl friday,L284564,u1357,BURNS,It doesn't have to rhyme!
31100,m90,his girl friday,L284562,u1357,BURNS,Exactly!
31102,m90,his girl friday,L284560,u1357,BURNS,Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides cowering... Afraid of every light of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
31103,m90,his girl friday,L284559,u1357,BURNS,I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
31105,m90,his girl friday,L284557,u1357,BURNS,Of course!  Roy Bensinger the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune Roy?
31107,m90,his girl friday,L284555,u1357,BURNS,Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn isn't it?
31109,m90,his girl friday,L284551,u1357,BURNS,Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
31110,m90,his girl friday,L284549,u1357,BURNS,The poem?... The poem was great!
31112,m90,his girl friday,L284547,u1357,BURNS,I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
31114,m90,his girl friday,L284545,u1357,BURNS,I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
31117,m90,his girl friday,L284540,u1357,BURNS,Hello Bensinger.
31119,m90,his girl friday,L284495,u1364,HILDY,Fine.
31120,m90,his girl friday,L284494,u1356,BRUCE,I'm taking the nine o'clock train Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
31121,m90,his girl friday,L284491,u1356,BRUCE,You got it back eh? There's something funny going on around here.
31122,m90,his girl friday,L284490,u1364,HILDY,Just a second Walter. Here Bruce here's the check... And oh Bruce here's your wallet. I got it back.
31123,m90,his girl friday,L284487,u1356,BRUCE,Thank you.
31124,m90,his girl friday,L284486,u1364,HILDY,Here it is Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
31125,m90,his girl friday,L284485,u1364,HILDY,Oh yes. Here it is.
31126,m90,his girl friday,L284484,u1356,BRUCE,Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
31127,m90,his girl friday,L284483,u1364,HILDY,No I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
31128,m90,his girl friday,L284482,u1356,BRUCE,Did you give her the money?
31129,m90,his girl friday,L284481,u1364,HILDY,Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
31130,m90,his girl friday,L284480,u1356,BRUCE,Hildy! Where's mother?
31131,m90,his girl friday,L284479,u1364,HILDY,Out some place.
31132,m90,his girl friday,L284478,u1356,BRUCE,Where'd she go?
31133,m90,his girl friday,L284477,u1364,HILDY,Oh she was here.
31134,m90,his girl friday,L284468,u1364,HILDY,Bruce you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
31135,m90,his girl friday,L284467,u1356,BRUCE,I know I got you into this Hildy but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
31136,m90,his girl friday,L284466,u1364,HILDY,We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
31137,m90,his girl friday,L284465,u1356,BRUCE,I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
31138,m90,his girl friday,L284461,u1364,HILDY,Bruce I know but I was in the biggest jam --
31139,m90,his girl friday,L284460,u1356,BRUCE,Not through any help of yours Hildy.
31140,m90,his girl friday,L284459,u1364,HILDY,BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
31141,m90,his girl friday,L284458,u1364,HILDY,Hello Bruce...
31142,m90,his girl friday,L284457,u1356,BRUCE,Hildy!
31143,m90,his girl friday,L283976,u1364,HILDY,Well the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.
31144,m90,his girl friday,L283975,u1356,BRUCE,But gee Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
31145,m90,his girl friday,L283974,u1364,HILDY,No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
31146,m90,his girl friday,L283973,u1364,HILDY,The Criminal Courts Building.
31147,m90,his girl friday,L283972,u1356,BRUCE,Did you finish the interview?
31148,m90,his girl friday,L283971,u1364,HILDY,Yes he is... Look Bruce we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train this time I mean it!
31149,m90,his girl friday,L283970,u1356,BRUCE,Oh I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow Hildy -- I found that out.
31150,m90,his girl friday,L283969,u1364,HILDY,Oh no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
31151,m90,his girl friday,L283968,u1356,BRUCE,For a minute I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
31152,m90,his girl friday,L283967,u1364,HILDY,I'm sure you haven't any.
31153,m90,his girl friday,L283966,u1356,BRUCE,I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
31154,m90,his girl friday,L283965,u1364,HILDY,Yes wasn't it?
31155,m90,his girl friday,L283964,u1356,BRUCE,That's right here. Gee it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
31156,m90,his girl friday,L283963,u1364,HILDY,The check Bruce!
31157,m90,his girl friday,L283962,u1356,BRUCE,I lost my wallet.
31158,m90,his girl friday,L283961,u1364,HILDY,What's the matter?
31159,m90,his girl friday,L283806,u1364,HILDY,Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
31160,m90,his girl friday,L283805,u1356,BRUCE,All right. I've done it. Now are you satisfied?
31161,m90,his girl friday,L283799,u1356,BRUCE,Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
31162,m90,his girl friday,L283798,u1364,HILDY,Hildy Johnson... Oh hello Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
31163,m90,his girl friday,L283693,u1364,HILDY,I'll be careful darling. You be please.
31164,m90,his girl friday,L283692,u1356,BRUCE,All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful honey.
31165,m90,his girl friday,L283691,u1364,HILDY,I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please dear.
31166,m90,his girl friday,L283690,u1356,BRUCE,But I don't gamble Hilda!
31167,m90,his girl friday,L283689,u1364,HILDY,Believe me Bruce I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
31168,m90,his girl friday,L283688,u1356,BRUCE,But --
31169,m90,his girl friday,L283687,u1364,HILDY,On second thought would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
31170,m90,his girl friday,L283686,u1356,BRUCE,The five hundred? Sure.
31171,m90,his girl friday,L283685,u1364,HILDY,Wait a minute Bruce. Have you got that money?
31172,m90,his girl friday,L283684,u1356,BRUCE,All right dear.
31173,m90,his girl friday,L283679,u1364,HILDY,Better make that a certified check Walter.
31174,m90,his girl friday,L283678,u1356,BRUCE,About twenty-five hundred dollars.
31175,m90,his girl friday,L283673,u1356,BRUCE,I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.
31176,m90,his girl friday,L283672,u1364,HILDY,According to the budget we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen Bruce I don't want Walter Burns to use me but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
31177,m90,his girl friday,L283671,u1356,BRUCE,But --
31178,m90,his girl friday,L283670,u1364,HILDY,And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
31179,m90,his girl friday,L283669,u1356,BRUCE,Well at his age twenty payment life a little over a thousand dollars.
31180,m90,his girl friday,L283668,u1364,HILDY,Wait a minute Bruce. What's commission on a $100000.00 policy?
31181,m90,his girl friday,L283667,u1356,BRUCE,I don't use my wife for business purposes Mr. Burns!
31182,m90,his girl friday,L283632,u1364,HILDY,He certainly -- hic -- does!
31183,m90,his girl friday,L283631,u1356,BRUCE,Say what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk doesn't he?
31184,m90,his girl friday,L283630,u1364,HILDY,No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
31185,m90,his girl friday,L283629,u1356,BRUCE,Too hot?
31186,m90,his girl friday,L283624,u1364,HILDY,That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
31187,m90,his girl friday,L283623,u1356,BRUCE,If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
31188,m90,his girl friday,L283622,u1364,HILDY,He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
31189,m90,his girl friday,L283621,u1356,BRUCE,Oh he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
31190,m90,his girl friday,L283620,u1364,HILDY,You're so nice Bruce you think everybody else is.
31191,m90,his girl friday,L283619,u1356,BRUCE,You know Hildy he's not a bad fellow.
31192,m90,his girl friday,L283585,u1364,HILDY,It will be perfectly all right Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
31193,m90,his girl friday,L283584,u1356,BRUCE,Oh it isn't like that.
31194,m90,his girl friday,L283367,u1364,HILDY,I'll come a-running pardner.
31195,m90,his girl friday,L283366,u1356,BRUCE,I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough remember I'm here.
31196,m90,his girl friday,L283365,u1364,HILDY,My job Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
31197,m90,his girl friday,L283364,u1356,BRUCE,I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
31198,m90,his girl friday,L283363,u1364,HILDY,Don't be embarrassed Bruce. I heard it but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
31199,m90,his girl friday,L283362,u1356,BRUCE,I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
31200,m90,his girl friday,L283360,u1356,BRUCE,Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
31201,m90,his girl friday,L283359,u1364,HILDY,I won't be more than ten minutes I promise you.
31202,m90,his girl friday,L284510,u1356,BRUCE,Say I want to be sure too!
31203,m90,his girl friday,L284509,u1357,BURNS,Oh this is all right Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
31204,m90,his girl friday,L284508,u1356,BRUCE,Gee! Take a look will you?
31205,m90,his girl friday,L284507,u1357,BURNS,There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
31206,m90,his girl friday,L284506,u1356,BRUCE,The money? Why?
31207,m90,his girl friday,L284505,u1357,BURNS,Oh Bruce let me see that money Hildy gave you.
31208,m90,his girl friday,L284504,u1357,BURNS,That's the kind of stuff they want!
31209,m90,his girl friday,L284503,u1356,BRUCE,She's -- well she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
31210,m90,his girl friday,L284502,u1357,BURNS,I'll find her Bruce if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
31211,m90,his girl friday,L284501,u1356,BRUCE,And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
31212,m90,his girl friday,L284500,u1357,BURNS,Ts! Ts! Ts!
31213,m90,his girl friday,L284499,u1356,BRUCE,Suppose she is -- I have feelings too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
31214,m90,his girl friday,L284498,u1357,BURNS,I know how you feel Bruce but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman after all.
31215,m90,his girl friday,L284497,u1356,BRUCE,If she's not there mother and I are leaving anyhow!
31216,m90,his girl friday,L284496,u1357,BURNS,I'll see she's there Bruce I promise you.
31217,m90,his girl friday,L284489,u1357,BURNS,Come on Hildy we've got to keep going! Sorry Bruce but --
31218,m90,his girl friday,L284488,u1356,BRUCE,And I'll take that certified check too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
31219,m90,his girl friday,L284476,u1356,BRUCE,Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
31220,m90,his girl friday,L284475,u1357,BURNS,No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
31221,m90,his girl friday,L284456,u1357,BURNS,What the devil do you want? Listen Bruce you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
31222,m90,his girl friday,L284455,u1356,BRUCE,Hildy!
31223,m90,his girl friday,L283790,u1356,BRUCE,So long.
31224,m90,his girl friday,L283789,u1357,BURNS,Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
31225,m90,his girl friday,L283788,u1356,BRUCE,Oh sure.  Well thanks for everything.
31226,m90,his girl friday,L283787,u1357,BURNS,Well I got to get back. You can find your way out can't you?
31227,m90,his girl friday,L283786,u1356,BRUCE,Thanks a lot.
31228,m90,his girl friday,L283785,u1357,BURNS,Well anyway I know Hildy's getting a good man.
31229,m90,his girl friday,L283784,u1356,BRUCE,Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
31230,m90,his girl friday,L283783,u1357,BURNS,Don't want to forget this you know. Might start to rain again.
31231,m90,his girl friday,L283782,u1357,BURNS,That's all I ask. Oh wait a minute.
31232,m90,his girl friday,L283781,u1356,BRUCE,Well she'll know some day.
31233,m90,his girl friday,L283780,u1356,BRUCE,Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
31234,m90,his girl friday,L283779,u1357,BURNS,Well Bruce here you are -- certified and everything.
31235,m90,his girl friday,L283776,u1357,BURNS,No Bruce you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
31236,m90,his girl friday,L283775,u1356,BRUCE,Gee you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
31237,m90,his girl friday,L283774,u1357,BURNS,And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
31238,m90,his girl friday,L283773,u1356,BRUCE,I'm beginning to realize that.
31239,m90,his girl friday,L283772,u1357,BURNS,And remember this Bruce! I love her too.
31240,m90,his girl friday,L283771,u1356,BRUCE,Well of course if you put it that way.
31241,m90,his girl friday,L283770,u1357,BURNS,Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
31242,m90,his girl friday,L283769,u1356,BRUCE,Well I'm independent too.
31243,m90,his girl friday,L283768,u1357,BURNS,Well you'll take care of her. After all if that doctor's right I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look Bruce this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her but she was too independent.
31244,m90,his girl friday,L283767,u1356,BRUCE,I feel I ought to take care of her.
31245,m90,his girl friday,L283766,u1357,BURNS,Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
31246,m90,his girl friday,L283765,u1356,BRUCE,I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
31247,m90,his girl friday,L283696,u1357,BURNS,You haven't seen anything yet.
31248,m90,his girl friday,L283695,u1356,BRUCE,I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
31249,m90,his girl friday,L283653,u1356,BRUCE,We could take the six o'clock train Hildy. If it would save a man's life.
31250,m90,his girl friday,L283652,u1357,BURNS,Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
31251,m90,his girl friday,L283651,u1356,BRUCE,How long would the interview take?
31252,m90,his girl friday,L283648,u1357,BURNS,How?
31253,m90,his girl friday,L283647,u1356,BRUCE,But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
31254,m90,his girl friday,L283646,u1357,BURNS,All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
31255,m90,his girl friday,L283645,u1356,BRUCE,Are you sure Williams is not all there?
31256,m90,his girl friday,L283640,u1357,BURNS,It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
31257,m90,his girl friday,L283639,u1356,BRUCE,Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
31258,m90,his girl friday,L283634,u1357,BURNS,Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
31259,m90,his girl friday,L283633,u1356,BRUCE,Anything the matter?
31260,m90,his girl friday,L283609,u1357,BURNS,I see what you mean.
31261,m90,his girl friday,L283608,u1356,BRUCE,Well I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
31262,m90,his girl friday,L283607,u1357,BURNS,I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but of course now it doesn't matter. Still I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
31263,m90,his girl friday,L283604,u1357,BURNS,I don't blame them.
31264,m90,his girl friday,L283603,u1356,BRUCE,Well Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
31265,m90,his girl friday,L283602,u1357,BURNS,How's business Bruce?
31266,m90,his girl friday,L283600,u1357,BURNS,Yes I know...  Hildy will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
31267,m90,his girl friday,L283599,u1356,BRUCE,Mighty nice little town Albany. They've got the State Capitol there you know.
31268,m90,his girl friday,L283598,u1357,BURNS,That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany too. Ow!
31269,m90,his girl friday,L283597,u1356,BRUCE,Just for the first year.
31270,m90,his girl friday,L283596,u1357,BURNS,I know you will Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
31271,m90,his girl friday,L283595,u1356,BRUCE,Well I'll try to give her one.
31272,m90,his girl friday,L283591,u1356,BRUCE,I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
31273,m90,his girl friday,L283590,u1357,BURNS,I know I wasn't a good husband Hildy but you can always count on me.
31274,m90,his girl friday,L283588,u1357,BURNS,Oh. Your mother -- well of course that relieves my mind.
31275,m90,his girl friday,L283587,u1356,BRUCE,No. My mother.
31276,m90,his girl friday,L283586,u1357,BURNS,Mother? But your mother --
31277,m90,his girl friday,L283583,u1357,BURNS,Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?
31278,m90,his girl friday,L283582,u1356,BRUCE,Feels awful good. Yes sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
31279,m90,his girl friday,L283581,u1357,BURNS,Well so you're getting married tomorrow eh? How does it feel Bruce?
31280,m90,his girl friday,L283560,u1357,BURNS,Just wanted to surprise you I guess.  Down!  After you Bruce!  Come on Hildy my treat!
31281,m90,his girl friday,L283559,u1356,BRUCE,No -- she didn't.
31282,m90,his girl friday,L283558,u1357,BURNS,Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
31283,m90,his girl friday,L283557,u1356,BRUCE,Where are we going?
31284,m90,his girl friday,L283556,u1357,BURNS,Attaboy!  Come on Bruce.
31285,m90,his girl friday,L283555,u1357,BURNS,That's right. -- Rubbers too I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
31286,m90,his girl friday,L283554,u1356,BRUCE,Well er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
31287,m90,his girl friday,L283553,u1357,BURNS,But I see she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella Bruce?
31288,m90,his girl friday,L283552,u1356,BRUCE,Oh.
31289,m90,his girl friday,L283551,u1357,BURNS,You see my wife -- I mean your wife -- that is I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
31290,m90,his girl friday,L283550,u1356,BRUCE,Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
31291,m90,his girl friday,L283549,u1357,BURNS,Oh I thought there was something funny... You see Bruce you don't mind if I call you Bruce do you? After all we're practically related --
31292,m90,his girl friday,L283547,u1357,BURNS,This is a pleasure Mr. Baldwin and I'm sorry about the mistake.
31293,m90,his girl friday,L283544,u1357,BURNS,Then who are you?
31294,m90,his girl friday,L283543,u1356,BRUCE,Yes!
31295,m90,his girl friday,L283542,u1357,BURNS,You're Bruce Baldwin?
31296,m90,his girl friday,L283541,u1356,BRUCE,I'm Bruce Baldwin!
31297,m90,his girl friday,L283540,u1357,BURNS,I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
31298,m90,his girl friday,L283539,u1356,BRUCE,Mr. Burns --
31299,m90,his girl friday,L284836,u1363,HARTMAN,Get out of here you!
31300,m90,his girl friday,L284835,u1357,BURNS,What's this?
31301,m90,his girl friday,L284826,u1363,HARTMAN,Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
31302,m90,his girl friday,L284825,u1357,BURNS,You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
31303,m90,his girl friday,L284784,u1357,BURNS,Do you want to get us scooped?
31304,m90,his girl friday,L284783,u1363,HARTMAN,No you don't!
31305,m90,his girl friday,L284782,u1357,BURNS,Call Duffy!
31306,m90,his girl friday,L284745,u1357,BURNS,Oh trying to frame me eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
31307,m90,his girl friday,L284744,u1363,HARTMAN,What about this Burns? Kidnapping eh?
31308,m90,his girl friday,L284729,u1363,HARTMAN,We'll take a chance on that Burns.  Go ahead boys. 
31309,m90,his girl friday,L284728,u1357,BURNS,I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
31310,m90,his girl friday,L284727,u1363,HARTMAN,You will eh? Well we'll see about that.  All right boys. Take it.
31311,m90,his girl friday,L284726,u1357,BURNS,Hartman if you take this desk out of this building I'll put you behind bars.
31312,m90,his girl friday,L284722,u1363,HARTMAN,We'll just start by impounding the Post property.  Is that your desk?
31313,m90,his girl friday,L284721,u1357,BURNS,You'll see nothing of the kind Sheriff.
31314,m90,his girl friday,L284720,u1363,HARTMAN,I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
31315,m90,his girl friday,L284719,u1357,BURNS,Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
31316,m90,his girl friday,L284718,u1363,HARTMAN,No? Well --  Johnson you're under arrest.  You too Burns.
31317,m90,his girl friday,L284709,u1363,HARTMAN,I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
31318,m90,his girl friday,L284708,u1357,BURNS,You're barking up the wrong tree Hartman.
31319,m90,his girl friday,L284701,u1363,HARTMAN,Oh you did! Well that's very very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
31320,m90,his girl friday,L284700,u1357,BURNS,I can explain that Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
31321,m90,his girl friday,L284685,u1363,HARTMAN,Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
31322,m90,his girl friday,L284684,u1357,BURNS,Get out!
31323,m90,his girl friday,L284683,u1363,HARTMAN,You'll ask me to what?
31324,m90,his girl friday,L284682,u1357,BURNS,If you've any accusations to make Hartman make them in the proper manner. Otherwise I'll have to ask you to get out.
31325,m90,his girl friday,L284668,u1363,HARTMAN,You can't bluff me Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
31326,m90,his girl friday,L284667,u1357,BURNS,Who do you think you are breaking in here like this?
31327,m90,his girl friday,L284874,u1368,MAYOR,What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
31328,m90,his girl friday,L284873,u1357,BURNS,Save that for the Tribune.
31329,m90,his girl friday,L284861,u1368,MAYOR,He's insane or drunk or something. Why if this unfortunate man Williams has really been reprieved I personally am tickled to death. Aren't you Pete?
31330,m90,his girl friday,L284860,u1357,BURNS,Out of the mouths of babes.
31331,m90,his girl friday,L284859,u1368,MAYOR,That's absurd on the face of it Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
31332,m90,his girl friday,L284830,u1368,MAYOR,The power of the press huh!
31333,m90,his girl friday,L284829,u1357,BURNS,This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
31334,m90,his girl friday,L284828,u1368,MAYOR,All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
31335,m90,his girl friday,L284827,u1357,BURNS,Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
31336,m90,his girl friday,L284823,u1368,MAYOR,Your luck's not with you now!
31337,m90,his girl friday,L284822,u1357,BURNS,Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
31338,m90,his girl friday,L284983,u1364,HILDY,You -- you!!
31339,m90,his girl friday,L284982,u1357,BURNS,But Hildy -- I can explain --
31340,m90,his girl friday,L284978,u1364,HILDY,Sure Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
31341,m90,his girl friday,L284977,u1357,BURNS,It'll be Heaven!
31342,m90,his girl friday,L284976,u1364,HILDY,Yes -- 'Hildy darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
31343,m90,his girl friday,L284975,u1357,BURNS,Hildy darling!
31344,m90,his girl friday,L284971,u1364,HILDY,Walter you can't do that!
31345,m90,his girl friday,L284970,u1357,BURNS,How about Bruce's?
31346,m90,his girl friday,L284961,u1364,HILDY,You're not fooling anybody.
31347,m90,his girl friday,L284960,u1357,BURNS,Hildy from this time on no tricks no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
31348,m90,his girl friday,L284959,u1364,HILDY,That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him Judge.
31349,m90,his girl friday,L284950,u1357,BURNS,Now don't argue Hildy.  How about it Judge?
31350,m90,his girl friday,L284949,u1364,HILDY,What!
31351,m90,his girl friday,L284945,u1357,BURNS,I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
31352,m90,his girl friday,L284944,u1364,HILDY,Well I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
31353,m90,his girl friday,L284943,u1357,BURNS,What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look Hildy I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
31354,m90,his girl friday,L284942,u1364,HILDY,What's the matter with my brains?
31355,m90,his girl friday,L284941,u1357,BURNS,Well if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
31356,m90,his girl friday,L284940,u1364,HILDY,What would you do if it was a daughter?
31357,m90,his girl friday,L284939,u1357,BURNS,Sure I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
31358,m90,his girl friday,L284938,u1364,HILDY,Walter!
31359,m90,his girl friday,L284937,u1357,BURNS,Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
31360,m90,his girl friday,L284936,u1364,HILDY,Niagara Falls! Walter you don't mean that?
31361,m90,his girl friday,L284935,u1357,BURNS,Hildy if that's what you want all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
31362,m90,his girl friday,L284934,u1364,HILDY,Well maybe I'd like to know just once!
31363,m90,his girl friday,L284933,u1357,BURNS,That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
31364,m90,his girl friday,L284932,u1364,HILDY,A fine honeymoon with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
31365,m90,his girl friday,L284931,u1357,BURNS,Sure it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't either.
31366,m90,his girl friday,L284930,u1364,HILDY,Thanks Walter but it's no good. We tried it.
31367,m90,his girl friday,L284929,u1357,BURNS,Both jobs are open Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
31368,m90,his girl friday,L284928,u1364,HILDY,It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
31369,m90,his girl friday,L284927,u1357,BURNS,Sure.
31370,m90,his girl friday,L284926,u1364,HILDY,On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took isn't it?
31371,m90,his girl friday,L284925,u1357,BURNS,Where'd you wire him?
31372,m90,his girl friday,L284924,u1364,HILDY,No he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
31373,m90,his girl friday,L284923,u1357,BURNS,What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
31374,m90,his girl friday,L284922,u1364,HILDY,Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving Walter.
31375,m90,his girl friday,L284921,u1357,BURNS,And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave Hildy!
31376,m90,his girl friday,L284920,u1364,HILDY,Thanks.
31377,m90,his girl friday,L284919,u1357,BURNS,The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you Hildy!
31378,m90,his girl friday,L284918,u1364,HILDY,Because I'm a newspaper woman Heaven help me!
31379,m90,his girl friday,L284917,u1357,BURNS,Then why are you doing it?
31380,m90,his girl friday,L284916,u1364,HILDY,Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
31381,m90,his girl friday,L284915,u1357,BURNS,Hildy!
31382,m90,his girl friday,L284914,u1364,HILDY,What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
31383,m90,his girl friday,L284913,u1357,BURNS,Well -- what is it?
31384,m90,his girl friday,L284911,u1364,HILDY,All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
31385,m90,his girl friday,L284910,u1357,BURNS,Flip a coin.
31386,m90,his girl friday,L284909,u1364,HILDY,I don't know what to do Walter.
31387,m90,his girl friday,L284908,u1357,BURNS,He's going to have you the rest of his life Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
31388,m90,his girl friday,L284907,u1364,HILDY,Yeah. I suppose I could. But Walter --
31389,m90,his girl friday,L284906,u1357,BURNS,Suit yourself kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
31390,m90,his girl friday,L284905,u1364,HILDY,Well if it's my last story I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't Walter.
31391,m90,his girl friday,L284904,u1357,BURNS,Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
31392,m90,his girl friday,L284903,u1364,HILDY,That's all right Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
31393,m90,his girl friday,L284902,u1357,BURNS,Sorry Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
31394,m90,his girl friday,L284901,u1364,HILDY,Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --
31395,m90,his girl friday,L284900,u1357,BURNS,In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
31396,m90,his girl friday,L284899,u1364,HILDY,We sure did but we had to go in hiding for a week.
31397,m90,his girl friday,L284898,u1357,BURNS,Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though didn't we?
31398,m90,his girl friday,L284897,u1364,HILDY,Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
31399,m90,his girl friday,L284896,u1357,BURNS,Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
31400,m90,his girl friday,L284895,u1364,HILDY,We've certainly been in some swell jams.
31401,m90,his girl friday,L284894,u1357,BURNS,I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through Hildy.
31402,m90,his girl friday,L284893,u1364,HILDY,In a way.
31403,m90,his girl friday,L284892,u1357,BURNS,Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well it's been a lot of fun.
31404,m90,his girl friday,L284891,u1364,HILDY,Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
31405,m90,his girl friday,L284890,u1357,BURNS,Don't tell me you were worried!
31406,m90,his girl friday,L284889,u1364,HILDY,How was that for a tight squeeze?
31407,m90,his girl friday,L284882,u1357,BURNS,And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years I think.
31408,m90,his girl friday,L284881,u1364,HILDY,Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
31409,m90,his girl friday,L284880,u1357,BURNS,Which ought to be about three hours more I'd say.
31410,m90,his girl friday,L284855,u1364,HILDY,Who did you talk to?
31411,m90,his girl friday,L284854,u1357,BURNS,When did you deliver this first?
31412,m90,his girl friday,L284851,u1364,HILDY,Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
31413,m90,his girl friday,L284850,u1357,BURNS,Murder uh?
31414,m90,his girl friday,L284849,u1364,HILDY,Wait a minute!  Let go there!
31415,m90,his girl friday,L284724,u1357,BURNS,Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
31416,m90,his girl friday,L284723,u1364,HILDY,No!
31417,m90,his girl friday,L284695,u1357,BURNS,What is it? Here!
31418,m90,his girl friday,L284694,u1364,HILDY,No you don't! Walter!
31419,m90,his girl friday,L284658,u1364,HILDY,Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
31420,m90,his girl friday,L284657,u1357,BURNS,Don't open that!
31421,m90,his girl friday,L284656,u1364,HILDY,I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
31422,m90,his girl friday,L284655,u1357,BURNS,Hildy you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
31423,m90,his girl friday,L284654,u1364,HILDY,Yes.
31424,m90,his girl friday,L284653,u1357,BURNS,When I'm surrounded with my back against the wall you're not going to lay down on me are you --
31425,m90,his girl friday,L284652,u1364,HILDY,Oh I see. I beg your pardon.
31426,m90,his girl friday,L284651,u1357,BURNS,Will you come here?

31429,m90,his girl friday,L284648,u1364,HILDY,Ring that number will you?
31430,m90,his girl friday,L284646,u1357,BURNS,That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?

31466,m90,his girl friday,L284575,u1364,HILDY,I'm finished.
31467,m90,his girl friday,L284574,u1357,BURNS,Tear into it will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
31468,m90,his girl friday,L284573,u1357,BURNS,You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
31469,m90,his girl friday,L284572,u1364,HILDY,Double-crossing swine!
31470,m90,his girl friday,L284529,u1357,BURNS,Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going will you?

31479,m90,his girl friday,L284493,u1364,HILDY,All right Walter.
31480,m90,his girl friday,L284492,u1357,BURNS,Hildy!
31481,m90,his girl friday,L284464,u1364,HILDY,Okay Walter. 
31482,m90,his girl friday,L284463,u1357,BURNS,For Pete's sake Hildy they're waiting for the rest of that story!
31483,m90,his girl friday,L284451,u1357,BURNS,Give him the works.  Hello Duffy get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
31484,m90,his girl friday,L284450,u1364,HILDY,How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
31485,m90,his girl friday,L284449,u1357,BURNS,Call him a love-child if you want to.  Duffy!
31486,m90,his girl friday,L284448,u1364,HILDY,Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
31487,m90,his girl friday,L284446,u1364,HILDY,Where's some paper?
31488,m90,his girl friday,L284445,u1357,BURNS,All the words you've got.
31489,m90,his girl friday,L284444,u1364,HILDY,How much do you want on it?
31490,m90,his girl friday,L284443,u1357,BURNS,Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load will you? Snap into it!
31491,m90,his girl friday,L284442,u1364,HILDY,Huh!
31492,m90,his girl friday,L284441,u1357,BURNS,Hildy!
31493,m90,his girl friday,L284440,u1357,BURNS,We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys. Quit stallin'.
31494,m90,his girl friday,L284439,u1364,HILDY,You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
31495,m90,his girl friday,L284438,u1357,BURNS,Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
31496,m90,his girl friday,L284437,u1364,HILDY,That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
31497,m90,his girl friday,L284436,u1357,BURNS,We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
31498,m90,his girl friday,L284435,u1364,HILDY,Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
31499,m90,his girl friday,L284434,u1357,BURNS,Attagirl! Why they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
31500,m90,his girl friday,L284433,u1364,HILDY,Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
31501,m90,his girl friday,L284432,u1357,BURNS,You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
31502,m90,his girl friday,L284431,u1364,HILDY,I get it!
31503,m90,his girl friday,L284430,u1357,BURNS,Well think it then because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
31504,m90,his girl friday,L284429,u1364,HILDY,I'd like to think.
31505,m90,his girl friday,L284428,u1357,BURNS,Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
31506,m90,his girl friday,L284427,u1364,HILDY,Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
31507,m90,his girl friday,L284426,u1357,BURNS,You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
31508,m90,his girl friday,L284425,u1364,HILDY,I know but --
31509,m90,his girl friday,L284424,u1357,BURNS,You drooling idiot! What do you mean you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
31510,m90,his girl friday,L284423,u1364,HILDY,Oh get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
31511,m90,his girl friday,L284422,u1357,BURNS,Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy this is war! You can't desert now!
31512,m90,his girl friday,L284421,u1364,HILDY,Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh Walter why did you have to do this to me?
31513,m90,his girl friday,L284420,u1357,BURNS,Where do you think you're going?
31514,m90,his girl friday,L284410,u1357,BURNS,I know. Where is he I said.
31515,m90,his girl friday,L284409,u1364,HILDY,She jumped out of the window.
31516,m90,his girl friday,L284408,u1357,BURNS,Yes. Where is he?
31517,m90,his girl friday,L284407,u1364,HILDY,Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
31518,m90,his girl friday,L284079,u1357,BURNS,Hold on a minute.
31519,m90,his girl friday,L284078,u1364,HILDY,It better be fifteen minutes because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
31520,m90,his girl friday,L284077,u1357,BURNS,That's great work Hildy... Huh? Oh will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
31521,m90,his girl friday,L284076,u1364,HILDY,No this is on the level Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor the Professor gave it to Earl and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
31522,m90,his girl friday,L284075,u1357,BURNS,No kidding Hildy.  Say this isn't a rib?
31523,m90,his girl friday,L284074,u1364,HILDY,Well I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker Sheriff Hartman!
31524,m90,his girl friday,L284073,u1364,HILDY,Well this expert Dr. Egelhoffer from New York decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
31525,m90,his girl friday,L284072,u1357,BURNS,I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical Hildy. What's the story?!
31526,m90,his girl friday,L284071,u1364,HILDY,Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
31527,m90,his girl friday,L284070,u1357,BURNS,You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
31528,m90,his girl friday,L284069,u1364,HILDY,Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
31529,m90,his girl friday,L284068,u1357,BURNS,Never mind that. What's the story?
31530,m90,his girl friday,L284067,u1364,HILDY,It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
31531,m90,his girl friday,L284066,u1357,BURNS,Exclusive? That's great.
31532,m90,his girl friday,L283683,u1364,HILDY,No thanks I've still got those. Well I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again too. Remember Bruce it must be certified.
31533,m90,his girl friday,L283682,u1357,BURNS,All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
31534,m90,his girl friday,L283681,u1364,HILDY,Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
31535,m90,his girl friday,L283680,u1357,BURNS,What do you think I am -- a crook?
31536,m90,his girl friday,L283677,u1364,HILDY,Oh nothing! Of course you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
31537,m90,his girl friday,L283676,u1357,BURNS,What tricks would I pull?
31538,m90,his girl friday,L283675,u1364,HILDY,You keep out of this. Bruce suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks Walter!
31539,m90,his girl friday,L283674,u1357,BURNS,Now you're talking!
31540,m90,his girl friday,L283666,u1357,BURNS,Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?
31541,m90,his girl friday,L283665,u1364,HILDY,We're not interested.
31542,m90,his girl friday,L283664,u1357,BURNS,All right Hildy I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
31543,m90,his girl friday,L283663,u1364,HILDY,I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning I claim it was done with mirrors.
31544,m90,his girl friday,L283662,u1357,BURNS,What do you mean?
31545,m90,his girl friday,L283661,u1364,HILDY,Well it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
31546,m90,his girl friday,L283660,u1357,BURNS,What do you mean only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
31547,m90,his girl friday,L283659,u1364,HILDY,What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you Bruce -- it's only an act!
31548,m90,his girl friday,L283658,u1357,BURNS,How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
31549,m90,his girl friday,L283657,u1357,BURNS,You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
31550,m90,his girl friday,L283656,u1364,HILDY,Why Walter you're getting poetic!
31551,m90,his girl friday,L283655,u1357,BURNS,I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
31552,m90,his girl friday,L283654,u1364,HILDY,No Bruce dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No Walter I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
31553,m90,his girl friday,L283644,u1357,BURNS,Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
31554,m90,his girl friday,L283643,u1364,HILDY,The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
31555,m90,his girl friday,L283642,u1357,BURNS,Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
31556,m90,his girl friday,L283641,u1364,HILDY,If he's nuts why doesn't the State just put him away?
31557,m90,his girl friday,L283638,u1357,BURNS,So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
31558,m90,his girl friday,L283637,u1364,HILDY,You said it.
31559,m90,his girl friday,L283636,u1357,BURNS,His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you drink is the ruin of this nation.
31560,m90,his girl friday,L283635,u1364,HILDY,What now?
31561,m90,his girl friday,L283615,u1364,HILDY,Thank you.
31562,m90,his girl friday,L283614,u1357,BURNS,Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
31563,m90,his girl friday,L283594,u1357,BURNS,Anyway I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.
31564,m90,his girl friday,L283593,u1364,HILDY,I might have Walter but you were never there.
31565,m90,his girl friday,L283592,u1357,BURNS,Well I'll tell you one thing old man she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
31566,m90,his girl friday,L283562,u1357,BURNS,How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
31567,m90,his girl friday,L283561,u1364,HILDY,I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember it's your last fling.
31568,m90,his girl friday,L283530,u1357,BURNS,Thanks.
31569,m90,his girl friday,L283529,u1364,HILDY,Allow me.
31570,m90,his girl friday,L283527,u1357,BURNS,Oh I'm sorry.
31571,m90,his girl friday,L283526,u1364,HILDY,And when he walks with a lady he waits for her!
31572,m90,his girl friday,L283525,u1357,BURNS,What for?
31573,m90,his girl friday,L283524,u1364,HILDY,And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
31574,m90,his girl friday,L283523,u1357,BURNS,No kidding?
31575,m90,his girl friday,L283522,u1364,HILDY,You wouldn't believe this Walter but Bruce holds the door open for me.
31576,m90,his girl friday,L283520,u1357,BURNS,Nothing personal. I was just asking.
31577,m90,his girl friday,L283519,u1364,HILDY,Now you got me.
31578,m90,his girl friday,L283518,u1357,BURNS,Then what does he want with you?
31579,m90,his girl friday,L283517,u1364,HILDY,Better.
31580,m90,his girl friday,L283516,u1357,BURNS,All right then come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
31581,m90,his girl friday,L283515,u1364,HILDY,Afraid? I should say not!
31582,m90,his girl friday,L283514,u1357,BURNS,You're not afraid are you?
31583,m90,his girl friday,L283513,u1364,HILDY,Oh better not Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
31584,m90,his girl friday,L283512,u1357,BURNS,Say could I meet him?
31585,m90,his girl friday,L283511,u1364,HILDY,Well he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
31586,m90,his girl friday,L283510,u1357,BURNS,Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
31587,m90,his girl friday,L283509,u1364,HILDY,Thanks...
31588,m90,his girl friday,L283508,u1357,BURNS,I wish you everything I couldn't give you Hildy.
31589,m90,his girl friday,L283507,u1364,HILDY,The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long Walter and better luck next time.
31590,m90,his girl friday,L283506,u1357,BURNS,Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
31591,m90,his girl friday,L283505,u1364,HILDY,Well I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
31592,m90,his girl friday,L283504,u1357,BURNS,Say sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
31593,m90,his girl friday,L283503,u1364,HILDY,I don't know about water buffaloes but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
31594,m90,his girl friday,L283502,u1357,BURNS,He does does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
31595,m90,his girl friday,L283501,u1364,HILDY,Well I can and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
31596,m90,his girl friday,L283500,u1357,BURNS,Oh sure it's honest. But somehow I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
31597,m90,his girl friday,L283499,u1364,HILDY,It's a good honest business isn't it?
31598,m90,his girl friday,L283498,u1357,BURNS,The insurance business?
31599,m90,his girl friday,L283497,u1364,HILDY,He's in the insurance business.
31600,m90,his girl friday,L283496,u1357,BURNS,What's his line?
31601,m90,his girl friday,L283495,u1364,HILDY,Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
31602,m90,his girl friday,L283494,u1357,BURNS,Bermuda... Rich eh?
31603,m90,his girl friday,L283493,u1364,HILDY,Bermuda.
31604,m90,his girl friday,L283492,u1357,BURNS,Where'd you meet this man?
31605,m90,his girl friday,L283491,u1364,HILDY,A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No Walter I'm through.
31606,m90,his girl friday,L283490,u1357,BURNS,I know you Hildy and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
31607,m90,his girl friday,L283489,u1364,HILDY,That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
31608,m90,his girl friday,L283488,u1357,BURNS,Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
31609,m90,his girl friday,L283487,u1364,HILDY,You can't sell me that Walter.
31610,m90,his girl friday,L283486,u1357,BURNS,Get married all you want to Hildy but you can't quit the newspaper business.
31611,m90,his girl friday,L283485,u1364,HILDY,I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married Walter and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
31612,m90,his girl friday,L283483,u1364,HILDY,Look at this! 
31613,m90,his girl friday,L283482,u1357,BURNS,Oh! In that case the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
31614,m90,his girl friday,L283481,u1364,HILDY,I'm not working for any other paper!
31615,m90,his girl friday,L283480,u1357,BURNS,Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
31616,m90,his girl friday,L283479,u1364,HILDY,Please! Will you just --
31617,m90,his girl friday,L283478,u1357,BURNS,All right -- thirty-five and not a cent more!
31618,m90,his girl friday,L283477,u1364,HILDY,Listen you bumble-headed baboon --
31619,m90,his girl friday,L283476,u1357,BURNS,If you won't do it for love how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
31620,m90,his girl friday,L283475,u1364,HILDY,Get away Svengali.
31621,m90,his girl friday,L283474,u1357,BURNS,Don't mock Hildy this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
31622,m90,his girl friday,L283472,u1357,BURNS,It'll bring us together again Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
31623,m90,his girl friday,L283471,u1364,HILDY,Keep away --
31624,m90,his girl friday,L283470,u1357,BURNS,You've got to help me Hildy.
31625,m90,his girl friday,L283469,u1364,HILDY,No!
31626,m90,his girl friday,L283468,u1357,BURNS,There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me unless --  Hildy!
31627,m90,his girl friday,L283467,u1364,HILDY,Well haven't you got anybody else?
31628,m90,his girl friday,L283466,u1357,BURNS,I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
31629,m90,his girl friday,L283465,u1364,HILDY,Sweeney?  Well after all he didn't do it on purpose did he?
31630,m90,his girl friday,L283464,u1357,BURNS,Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
31631,m90,his girl friday,L283463,u1364,HILDY,Dead?
31632,m90,his girl friday,L283462,u1357,BURNS,Sweeney.
31633,m90,his girl friday,L283461,u1364,HILDY,What's the matter?
31634,m90,his girl friday,L283460,u1357,BURNS,Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh no Sweeney... Well I suppose so... All right. If you have to you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
31635,m90,his girl friday,L283457,u1364,HILDY,You -- you --
31636,m90,his girl friday,L283456,u1357,BURNS,Well you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
31637,m90,his girl friday,L283455,u1364,HILDY,I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
31638,m90,his girl friday,L283454,u1357,BURNS,It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
31639,m90,his girl friday,L283453,u1364,HILDY,Well the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out Walter.
31640,m90,his girl friday,L283452,u1357,BURNS,I made a great reporter out of you Hildy but you won't be half as good on any other paper and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
31641,m90,his girl friday,L283451,u1364,HILDY,Listen Walter --
31642,m90,his girl friday,L283450,u1357,BURNS,Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
31643,m90,his girl friday,L283449,u1364,HILDY,You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
31644,m90,his girl friday,L283448,u1357,BURNS,What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
31645,m90,his girl friday,L283447,u1364,HILDY,I know Walter but I --
31646,m90,his girl friday,L283446,u1357,BURNS,Well go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
31647,m90,his girl friday,L283445,u1364,HILDY,You bet I've got a better offer.
31648,m90,his girl friday,L283444,u1357,BURNS,You've had a better offer eh?
31649,m90,his girl friday,L283443,u1364,HILDY,That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
31650,m90,his girl friday,L283442,u1357,BURNS,You mean you're not coming back to work here?
31651,m90,his girl friday,L283441,u1364,HILDY,Just what I said. That's what I --
31652,m90,his girl friday,L283440,u1357,BURNS,What do you mean by that?
31653,m90,his girl friday,L283439,u1364,HILDY,Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more you're not going to be my boss.
31654,m90,his girl friday,L283438,u1357,BURNS,Sure you can. Come on.
31655,m90,his girl friday,L283437,u1364,HILDY,No I can't.
31656,m90,his girl friday,L283436,u1357,BURNS,You can break it can't you?
31657,m90,his girl friday,L283435,u1364,HILDY,I have a lunch date. I just want --
31658,m90,his girl friday,L283434,u1357,BURNS,Sure come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
31659,m90,his girl friday,L283433,u1364,HILDY,Walter you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
31660,m90,his girl friday,L283432,u1357,BURNS,I haven't any hard feelings.
31661,m90,his girl friday,L283431,u1364,HILDY,What?!!
31662,m90,his girl friday,L283430,u1357,BURNS,Let's not fight Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way we'll get married again.
31663,m90,his girl friday,L283429,u1364,HILDY,Well suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look Walter I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it because I'm --
31664,m90,his girl friday,L283428,u1357,BURNS,Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
31665,m90,his girl friday,L283427,u1364,HILDY,All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
31666,m90,his girl friday,L283426,u1357,BURNS,Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon Hildy -- honest I did.
31667,m90,his girl friday,L283423,u1364,HILDY,What home?
31668,m90,his girl friday,L283422,u1357,BURNS,Well I don't want to brag but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
31669,m90,his girl friday,L283421,u1364,HILDY,A fellow your age hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
31670,m90,his girl friday,L283420,u1357,BURNS,Well I meant to let you go -- but you know you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
31671,m90,his girl friday,L283419,u1364,HILDY,Well why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
31672,m90,his girl friday,L283418,u1357,BURNS,Now that's a nice thing to say.
31673,m90,his girl friday,L283417,u1364,HILDY,I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
31674,m90,his girl friday,L283416,u1357,BURNS,Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
31675,m90,his girl friday,L283415,u1364,HILDY,Holy mackerel! Look Walter that's what divorces are for.
31676,m90,his girl friday,L283414,u1357,BURNS,Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
31677,m90,his girl friday,L283413,u1364,HILDY,Done what?
31678,m90,his girl friday,L283412,u1357,BURNS,You know Hildy I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
31679,m90,his girl friday,L283411,u1364,HILDY,I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it I wouldn't have divorced you.
31680,m90,his girl friday,L283410,u1357,BURNS,I notice you still remember it.
31681,m90,his girl friday,L283407,u1357,BURNS,Oh yes I would. I'd know you any time --
31682,m90,his girl friday,L283406,u1364,HILDY,No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
31683,m90,his girl friday,L283405,u1357,BURNS,Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
31684,m90,his girl friday,L283404,u1364,HILDY,Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh about four months I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
31685,m90,his girl friday,L283403,u1357,BURNS,You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
31686,m90,his girl friday,L283402,u1364,HILDY,How long is what?
31687,m90,his girl friday,L283377,u1364,HILDY,Hello Walter.  Hi Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
31688,m90,his girl friday,L283376,u1357,BURNS,Hello Hildy!
31689,m90,his girl friday,L283375,u1364,HILDY,Why I'm surprised Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
31690,m90,his girl friday,L283374,u1357,BURNS,What do you want?
31692,m90,his girl friday,L284770,u1357,BURNS,You grey-haired old Judas!
31695,m90,his girl friday,L284753,u1357,BURNS,Come on Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
31697,m90,his girl friday,L284742,u1357,BURNS,Are you referring to me Madam?
31699,m90,his girl friday,L284414,u1357,BURNS,Louie take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
31701,m90,his girl friday,L284642,u1357,BURNS,I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
31703,m90,his girl friday,L284640,u1357,BURNS,You got plenty of money?
31705,m90,his girl friday,L284638,u1357,BURNS,Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
31707,m90,his girl friday,L284636,u1357,BURNS,Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
31710,m90,his girl friday,L284617,u1357,BURNS,You stay here. I'll find out everything.
31712,m90,his girl friday,L284603,u1357,BURNS,Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
31714,m90,his girl friday,L284601,u1357,BURNS,Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere and you hand her over to the cops!
31715,m90,his girl friday,L284589,u1357,BURNS,Take that mush out of your mouth!
31717,m90,his girl friday,L283778,u1357,BURNS,Don't worry Duffy you'll have it back by five.  Thanks Duffy. Stick around. 
31719,m90,his girl friday,L283392,u1357,BURNS,Yeah! Well I do the firing too. Remember that Duffy and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
31721,m90,his girl friday,L283388,u1357,BURNS,They can't do that to me!
31723,m90,his girl friday,L283386,u1357,BURNS,You're crazy. Where's Mac?
31725,m90,his girl friday,L283384,u1357,BURNS,What?
31727,m90,his girl friday,L283382,u1357,BURNS,I'm busy Duffy.
31729,m90,his girl friday,L284036,u1364,HILDY,First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
31732,m90,his girl friday,L284033,u1364,HILDY,Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
31734,m90,his girl friday,L284031,u1364,HILDY,A lot of money.  Four hundred and fifty dollars --
31736,m90,his girl friday,L284029,u1364,HILDY,There's money in it Cooley.
31738,m90,his girl friday,L284027,u1364,HILDY,Cooley I want to talk to you.
31739,m90,his girl friday,L283813,u1364,HILDY,I thought so. Come on I'm in a hurry.
31741,m90,his girl friday,L283811,u1364,HILDY,Say isn't this your twenty dollars?
31743,m90,his girl friday,L283809,u1364,HILDY,I want to interview Earl Williams Warden. How about a little service?
31746,m90,his girl friday,L283997,u1363,HARTMAN,I don't know --
31748,m90,his girl friday,L283938,u1363,HARTMAN,It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
31750,m90,his girl friday,L283936,u1363,HARTMAN,A joint interview eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together Doctor.
31752,m90,his girl friday,L283934,u1363,HARTMAN,Well I don't know if that's ethical. You see all statements are supposed to come from me.
31754,m90,his girl friday,L283932,u1363,HARTMAN,Me too.
31756,m90,his girl friday,L283930,u1363,HARTMAN,You said it!
31769,m90,his girl friday,L284358,u1364,HILDY,Aw why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
31772,m90,his girl friday,L284349,u1364,HILDY,A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
31774,m90,his girl friday,L284327,u1364,HILDY,Give me a hand with her will you?
31776,m90,his girl friday,L284325,u1364,HILDY,Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
31778,m90,his girl friday,L284322,u1364,HILDY,Run down and get some smelling salts will you?
31780,m90,his girl friday,L284316,u1364,HILDY,Mollie drop down here! You've fainted!
31782,m90,his girl friday,L284310,u1364,HILDY,All right -- all right!
31784,m90,his girl friday,L284304,u1364,HILDY,Just a second Mike ---  Mollie I got it!
31787,m90,his girl friday,L283729,u1364,HILDY,Three bullets! Any good?
31789,m90,his girl friday,L283714,u1364,HILDY,I know I just want to give him a thrill.
31791,m90,his girl friday,L283707,u1364,HILDY,Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
31835,m90,his girl friday,L283610,u1364,HILDY,Gus this --
31837,m90,his girl friday,L283605,u1364,HILDY,Oh I'm sorry Gus! My foot must have slipped.
31839,m90,his girl friday,L283574,u1364,HILDY,No -- just coffee Gus.
31840,m90,his girl friday,L283573,u1364,HILDY,I guess so.
31842,m90,his girl friday,L283571,u1364,HILDY,Oh -- I'll take the same I guess. And coffee.
31844,m90,his girl friday,L283566,u1364,HILDY,How's everything Gus?

31848,m90,his girl friday,L284767,u1363,HARTMAN,Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
31849,m90,his girl friday,L284766,u1364,HILDY,He's harmless.
31850,m90,his girl friday,L284712,u1364,HILDY,With a bag of marshmallows.
31851,m90,his girl friday,L284711,u1363,HARTMAN,What?
31852,m90,his girl friday,L284710,u1364,HILDY,He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
31853,m90,his girl friday,L284699,u1363,HARTMAN,Not this gun!
31854,m90,his girl friday,L284698,u1364,HILDY,I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
31855,m90,his girl friday,L284697,u1363,HARTMAN,Where'd you get this?
31856,m90,his girl friday,L284690,u1363,HARTMAN,All right boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.
31857,m90,his girl friday,L284689,u1364,HILDY,What do I know about Williams?
31858,m90,his girl friday,L284688,u1363,HARTMAN,Johnson I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
31859,m90,his girl friday,L284679,u1364,HILDY,Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!
31860,m90,his girl friday,L284678,u1363,HARTMAN,I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
31861,m90,his girl friday,L284677,u1364,HILDY,You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
31862,m90,his girl friday,L284676,u1363,HARTMAN,Johnson there's something very peculiar going on.
31863,m90,his girl friday,L284675,u1364,HILDY,I don't know anything I tell you. There's been an accident.
31864,m90,his girl friday,L284670,u1363,HARTMAN,Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
31865,m90,his girl friday,L284669,u1364,HILDY,Let me go!  Fellows something's happened to my mother-in-law.
31866,m90,his girl friday,L284666,u1363,HARTMAN,Hold her boys!
31867,m90,his girl friday,L284665,u1364,HILDY,Take your paws off me!
31868,m90,his girl friday,L284662,u1364,HILDY,Let go o' me. What's the idea?
31869,m90,his girl friday,L284661,u1363,HARTMAN,Just a minute Johnson!
31870,m90,his girl friday,L283865,u1364,HILDY,That's awful kind of you Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.
31871,m90,his girl friday,L283864,u1363,HARTMAN,You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story Hildy.
31872,m90,his girl friday,L283863,u1364,HILDY,No thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
31873,m90,his girl friday,L283858,u1363,HARTMAN,Oh that'll be all right Hildy. Go ahead run it. And you can say I treated him well too.  'Lo Earl. How are you feeling?
31874,m90,his girl friday,L283857,u1364,HILDY,Oh nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
31875,m90,his girl friday,L283856,u1363,HARTMAN,Now wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
31876,m90,his girl friday,L283855,u1364,HILDY,All right then I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course with election coming that might do you a lot of harm but just as you say.
31877,m90,his girl friday,L283854,u1363,HARTMAN,I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
31878,m90,his girl friday,L283853,u1364,HILDY,Same way you did.  Through that gate.
31879,m90,his girl friday,L284111,u1363,HARTMAN,Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
31882,m90,his girl friday,L284053,u1363,HARTMAN,After all I've done for you --
31884,m90,his girl friday,L284051,u1363,HARTMAN,A fine fair-weather friend you are!
31886,m90,his girl friday,L284049,u1363,HARTMAN,What went off?
31888,m90,his girl friday,L284047,u1363,HARTMAN,If the Mayor wants me he knows where I am.
31890,m90,his girl friday,L284219,u1363,HARTMAN,Just one second --
31892,m90,his girl friday,L284196,u1363,HARTMAN,Well wait a minute will you? I'm in conference.
31894,m90,his girl friday,L284166,u1363,HARTMAN,Read it! Insane he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
31896,m90,his girl friday,L284157,u1363,HARTMAN,For who?
31898,m90,his girl friday,L284151,u1363,HARTMAN,I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
31899,m90,his girl friday,L284887,u1368,MAYOR,So do you what you hoodoo!  And now Mr. Pinkus if you'll come with us we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
31900,m90,his girl friday,L284886,u1363,HARTMAN,And so do I!
31901,m90,his girl friday,L284870,u1363,HARTMAN,I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
31902,m90,his girl friday,L284869,u1368,MAYOR,Walter I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
31903,m90,his girl friday,L284868,u1363,HARTMAN,I was just going to!
31904,m90,his girl friday,L284867,u1368,MAYOR,Take those handcuffs off our friends Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
31905,m90,his girl friday,L284853,u1368,MAYOR,I never saw him before!
31906,m90,his girl friday,L284852,u1363,HARTMAN,That's a lie!!
31907,m90,his girl friday,L284848,u1363,HARTMAN,It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
31908,m90,his girl friday,L284847,u1368,MAYOR,You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
31909,m90,his girl friday,L284841,u1363,HARTMAN,Throw him out Frank.
31910,m90,his girl friday,L284840,u1368,MAYOR,Who is this man?
31911,m90,his girl friday,L284821,u1368,MAYOR,Well! Looks like about ten years apiece for you birds!
31912,m90,his girl friday,L284820,u1363,HARTMAN,Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
31913,m90,his girl friday,L284819,u1368,MAYOR,A sight for sore eyes!
31914,m90,his girl friday,L284818,u1363,HARTMAN,Look kind o' natural don't they Fred?
31915,m90,his girl friday,L284817,u1368,MAYOR,Fine work Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
31916,m90,his girl friday,L284230,u1363,HARTMAN,If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
31917,m90,his girl friday,L284229,u1368,MAYOR,Now take that guilty look off your face Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
31918,m90,his girl friday,L284228,u1363,HARTMAN,Hello Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen Olsen five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes I'll be right out there.  Well I hope that's the right thing to do.
31919,m90,his girl friday,L284227,u1368,MAYOR,Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now do as I tell you.
31920,m90,his girl friday,L284226,u1363,HARTMAN,I don't know Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
31921,m90,his girl friday,L284225,u1368,MAYOR,Shoot to kill I said.
31922,m90,his girl friday,L284224,u1363,HARTMAN,What?
31923,m90,his girl friday,L284223,u1368,MAYOR,All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
31924,m90,his girl friday,L284222,u1363,HARTMAN,Just -- one -- second!
31925,m90,his girl friday,L284221,u1368,MAYOR,We'll fix that too. 
31926,m90,his girl friday,L284207,u1368,MAYOR,Now what do you say?
31927,m90,his girl friday,L284206,u1363,HARTMAN,Hold your horses -- will you Olsen? Hurry up Fred!
31928,m90,his girl friday,L284188,u1368,MAYOR,How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
31929,m90,his girl friday,L284187,u1363,HARTMAN,No -- don't out me off.
31930,m90,his girl friday,L284180,u1368,MAYOR,Cover up that transmitter!
31931,m90,his girl friday,L284179,u1363,HARTMAN,I did.  Hold the wire.
31932,m90,his girl friday,L284178,u1368,MAYOR,Tell 'em to hold the wire.
31933,m90,his girl friday,L284177,u1363,HARTMAN,They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
31934,m90,his girl friday,L284176,u1368,MAYOR,What is it?
31935,m90,his girl friday,L284175,u1363,HARTMAN,Sssh. Wait Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
31936,m90,his girl friday,L284174,u1368,MAYOR,And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
31937,m90,his girl friday,L284173,u1363,HARTMAN,Ah Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
31938,m90,his girl friday,L284172,u1368,MAYOR,Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
31939,m90,his girl friday,L284171,u1363,HARTMAN,We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
31940,m90,his girl friday,L284170,u1368,MAYOR,Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
31941,m90,his girl friday,L284169,u1363,HARTMAN,An attempt to ruin us!
31942,m90,his girl friday,L284168,u1368,MAYOR,Pure politics!
31943,m90,his girl friday,L284161,u1368,MAYOR,And you fell for it Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
31944,m90,his girl friday,L284160,u1363,HARTMAN,The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
31945,m90,his girl friday,L284146,u1363,HARTMAN,But we're going to hang him Fred. He can't get away.
31946,m90,his girl friday,L284145,u1368,MAYOR,I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
31947,m90,his girl friday,L284144,u1363,HARTMAN,Well there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
31948,m90,his girl friday,L284143,u1368,MAYOR,Williams ain't a Red and you know it!
31949,m90,his girl friday,L284142,u1368,MAYOR,We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
31950,m90,his girl friday,L284141,u1363,HARTMAN,That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
31951,m90,his girl friday,L284139,u1368,MAYOR,If there was any way out...
31952,m90,his girl friday,L284138,u1363,HARTMAN,Our families Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
31953,m90,his girl friday,L284137,u1368,MAYOR,I wish you wouldn't talk like that Pete.
31954,m90,his girl friday,L284136,u1363,HARTMAN,Fred I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
31955,m90,his girl friday,L284135,u1368,MAYOR,Now Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
31956,m90,his girl friday,L284134,u1363,HARTMAN,Fred!
31957,m90,his girl friday,L284133,u1368,MAYOR,I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
31958,m90,his girl friday,L284132,u1363,HARTMAN,What do you mean -- through?
31959,m90,his girl friday,L284131,u1368,MAYOR,Pete you're through!
31960,m90,his girl friday,L284130,u1363,HARTMAN,If you're talking about my brother- in-law he's worked for the city fifteen years.
31961,m90,his girl friday,L284129,u1368,MAYOR,Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
31962,m90,his girl friday,L284128,u1363,HARTMAN,I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
31963,m90,his girl friday,L284127,u1368,MAYOR,Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
31964,m90,his girl friday,L284126,u1363,HARTMAN,Now listen Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
31965,m90,his girl friday,L284116,u1368,MAYOR,Pete I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
31966,m90,his girl friday,L284115,u1363,HARTMAN,The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
31967,m90,his girl friday,L284114,u1368,MAYOR,Did you actually give Williams that gun?
31968,m90,his girl friday,L284113,u1363,HARTMAN,I ain't got time Fred honest. I'll see you after.
31969,m90,his girl friday,L284112,u1368,MAYOR,Pete I want to talk to you!
31971,m90,his girl friday,L284797,u1363,HARTMAN,Got you Williams!
31972,m90,his girl friday,L283995,u1363,HARTMAN,Yeah you don't want to tire him out Doctor.
31974,m90,his girl friday,L283862,u1363,HARTMAN,Hildy how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
31976,m90,his girl friday,L283860,u1363,HARTMAN,That's good Earl. Oh they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep will you?
31979,m90,his girl friday,L283958,u1364,HILDY,You'll take fifty and like it!
31981,m90,his girl friday,L283956,u1364,HILDY,You can let him out on bail can't you?
31983,m90,his girl friday,L283954,u1364,HILDY,All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
31985,m90,his girl friday,L283952,u1364,HILDY,Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
31987,m90,his girl friday,L283950,u1364,HILDY,And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
31989,m90,his girl friday,L283948,u1364,HILDY,Let him out of here Lieutenant.
31991,m90,his girl friday,L284953,u1364,HILDY,Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 
31993,m90,his girl friday,L284599,u1364,HILDY,-- You were with her. You were in the cab weren't you?
31995,m90,his girl friday,L284597,u1364,HILDY,What did you do with her?
31997,m90,his girl friday,L284593,u1364,HILDY,Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
32000,m90,his girl friday,L284590,u1364,HILDY,Where's the old lady?
32002,m90,his girl friday,L284416,u1364,HILDY,Wait a minute Walter. You can't do that!
32003,m90,his girl friday,L283379,u1364,HILDY,Editorials?

I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect but suppose Central is listening in... Oh did you hear that Central? We ought to report him don't you think?... Oh fooey on you!
32017,m90,his girl friday,L283983,u1364,HILDY,It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello Post... Mr. Walter Burns please.

32032,m90,his girl friday,L283801,u1364,HILDY,But Bruce don't keep it in your wallet!... Well you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
32034,m90,his girl friday,L283793,u1364,HILDY,Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
32036,m90,his girl friday,L283791,u1364,HILDY,I don't know why you boys are so good to me.

32089,m90,his girl friday,L284268,u1364,HILDY,Earl you must never do that again.
32091,m90,his girl friday,L284265,u1364,HILDY,I don't blame you Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody either.
32093,m90,his girl friday,L284263,u1364,HILDY,Earl there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
32095,m90,his girl friday,L284261,u1364,HILDY,Sure you could Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
32098,m90,his girl friday,L284258,u1364,HILDY,Earl you don't want to hurt your friends do you?
32100,m90,his girl friday,L284255,u1364,HILDY,Put down that gun Earl.
32102,m90,his girl friday,L283867,u1364,HILDY,I won't Earl.

32107,m90,his girl friday,L283846,u1364,HILDY,No Earl not at all.  Who sent you the flowers Earl?
32109,m90,his girl friday,L283844,u1364,HILDY,Very simple Earl.
32111,m90,his girl friday,L283842,u1364,HILDY,Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
32113,m90,his girl friday,L283838,u1364,HILDY,Yes that makes a lot of sense Earl.
32116,m90,his girl friday,L283834,u1364,HILDY,How would you go about applying the Golden Rule Earl?
32118,m90,his girl friday,L283832,u1364,HILDY,What are your beliefs Earl?
32120,m90,his girl friday,L283830,u1364,HILDY,You didn't mean to kill that policeman?

32555,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290391,u1392,DENISE,Yeah Jerry she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
32556,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290385,u1394,JERRY,I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
32557,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290384,u1392,DENISE,You know what Jerry who really cares at this point?
32558,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290383,u1394,JERRY,I don't know I just thought it was interesting.
32559,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290382,u1392,DENISE,So what?
32560,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290381,u1394,JERRY,These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
32561,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290380,u1392,DENISE,Yeah?
32562,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290378,u1392,DENISE,Why?
32563,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290377,u1394,JERRY,Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
32564,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290376,u1392,DENISE,So.
32565,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290374,u1392,DENISE,Yeah so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
32566,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290373,u1394,JERRY,Yeah in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
32567,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290372,u1392,DENISE,Oh yeah.
32568,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290371,u1394,JERRY,Hey listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
32569,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290370,u1392,DENISE,Fuck it's freezing.
32570,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290237,u1392,DENISE,That seems likely.
32571,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290236,u1394,JERRY,Hey maybe she knows where this is?
32572,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290217,u1394,JERRY,Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
32573,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290216,u1392,DENISE,Ugh what's that smell?

32576,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290179,u1392,DENISE,I don't want to see that.
32577,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290178,u1394,JERRY,This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
32578,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290177,u1392,DENISE,Tickets for what?
32579,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290176,u1394,JERRY,Great you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.

32583,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290200,u1392,DENISE,Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes Dad I'm kidding.
32585,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290198,u1392,DENISE,Yeah well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies you know Jerry... yeah he's gotta see everything... yeah I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
32587,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290196,u1392,DENISE,No nothing like that... yeah we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing so we're kind of behind schedule.
32589,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290524,u1395,MARY,Yeah it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
32590,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290523,u1392,DENISE,Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
32591,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290490,u1392,DENISE,Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
32592,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290489,u1395,MARY,A couple hours!

32594,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290454,u1392,DENISE,Excuse me may I please use your phone?
32595,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290422,u1395,MARY,I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
32596,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290421,u1392,DENISE,Jesus Christ.
32597,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290415,u1392,DENISE,Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
32598,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290414,u1395,MARY,I still don't.
32599,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290413,u1392,DENISE,Shhhhhh quiet.

32602,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290409,u1392,DENISE,What? I didn't hear anything.
32603,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290408,u1395,MARY,What was that?
32604,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290407,u1392,DENISE,I don't know... about half an hour.
32605,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290406,u1395,MARY,How long has it been?
32606,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290395,u1392,DENISE,Yeah she said we looked queer.
32607,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290394,u1395,MARY,She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
32608,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290343,u1392,DENISE,I can't believe...
32609,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290342,u1395,MARY,I think I'm going fucking crazy.
32610,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290304,u1395,MARY,God damn it I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
32611,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290303,u1392,DENISE,You got to be fucking joking.
32612,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290302,u1395,MARY,Don't even say it.
32613,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290242,u1395,MARY,She looks like she stinks.
32614,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290241,u1392,DENISE,Stick her in the front if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
32615,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290229,u1392,DENISE,Aw Christ Jerry. We can't see anything now it's too dark. Let's forget it.
32616,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290228,u1395,MARY,Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
32617,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290211,u1395,MARY,Maybe he's a cyborg.
32618,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290210,u1392,DENISE,Never. I swear to God he never sleeps he goes to bed after me wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
32619,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290209,u1395,MARY,Geez he never gets tired does he.
32620,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290175,u1395,MARY,Exactly... well I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.
32621,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290174,u1392,DENISE,Scattered smothered and covered.
32622,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290173,u1395,MARY,If I never eat at another Waffle House again I can die a happy girl.
32623,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290172,u1392,DENISE,A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either this road food is crap.
32624,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290171,u1395,MARY,I know that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
32625,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290170,u1392,DENISE,Yeah I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
32626,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290169,u1395,MARY,It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun but it's starting to get brutal.
32627,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290167,u1395,MARY,Yeah hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
32628,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290166,u1392,DENISE,God I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh my back is killing me.

32630,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290164,u1392,DENISE,I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
32631,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290141,u1395,MARY,Aw shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
32632,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290140,u1392,DENISE,Aw it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
32633,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290139,u1395,MARY,Christ I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
32634,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290138,u1392,DENISE,Too late. You're in for life let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
32635,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290137,u1395,MARY,I resign.
32636,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290136,u1392,DENISE,Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.

32672,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290519,u1394,JERRY,Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.
32673,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290478,u1394,JERRY,I was just kidding.
32675,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290476,u1394,JERRY,And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
32676,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290472,u1394,JERRY,I don't doubt that.
32678,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290470,u1394,JERRY,Well I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
32680,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290463,u1394,JERRY,Um I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
32682,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290461,u1394,JERRY,Oh right.
32684,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290459,u1394,JERRY,Hey maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
32685,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290590,u1394,JERRY,Negative. Shit we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
32686,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290589,u1395,MARY,I'm with Denise can't we just walk to someplace this is getting fucking stupid.
32687,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290567,u1395,MARY,I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit that's the words.
32688,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290566,u1394,JERRY,This is way too fucked up for words.
32689,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290424,u1395,MARY,Enough with the stupid voices.
32690,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290423,u1394,JERRY,OK lassies I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
32691,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290420,u1395,MARY,What!
32692,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290419,u1394,JERRY,Hold on hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
32693,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290390,u1395,MARY,You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
32694,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290389,u1394,JERRY,Oh don't blow everything out of proportion.
32695,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290388,u1395,MARY,That stupid hillbilly slut.
32696,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290387,u1394,JERRY,Huh?

32700,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290333,u1394,JERRY,I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way right?
32701,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290332,u1395,MARY,Just back up.
32702,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290215,u1395,MARY,Huh?
32703,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290214,u1394,JERRY,We hit the jackpot! Let's roll good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
32704,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290204,u1394,JERRY,Shit it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. Hold on for two seconds.
32705,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290203,u1395,MARY,Aw come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.

32707,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290610,u1395,MARY,Don't worry I'm gone.
32710,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290496,u1395,MARY,Sorry.

32718,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290645,u1395,MARY,Fuck you you fucking freak!
32720,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290643,u1395,MARY,This can't be real this can't be real this can't be real.
32723,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290639,u1395,MARY,Where is he?
32725,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290637,u1395,MARY,Where's Bill?
32727,m92,house of 1000 corpses,L290635,u1395,MARY,Why? Why are you doing this?
37238,m105,jackie brown,L313916,u1593,JACKIE,I'm sorry I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
37239,m105,jackie brown,L313904,u1593,JACKIE,Thanks.
37241,m105,jackie brown,L313902,u1593,JACKIE,I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
37243,m105,jackie brown,L313900,u1593,JACKIE,This looks pretty good on me.
37244,m105,jackie brown,L313898,u1593,JACKIE,Yes you have a suit I've had my eye on.
37246,m105,jackie brown,L313104,u1595,MAX,I won't forget.
37248,m105,jackie brown,L313102,u1595,MAX,I'll call her.
37252,m105,jackie brown,L313096,u1595,MAX,I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.
37254,m105,jackie brown,L313094,u1595,MAX,I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided I'll never write you again. You understand?
37256,m105,jackie brown,L313092,u1595,MAX,But then you told her you were home.
37258,m105,jackie brown,L313090,u1595,MAX,But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
37260,m105,jackie brown,L313088,u1595,MAX,Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid but she's mad at you because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
37261,m105,jackie brown,L312938,u1598,ORDELL,But the only way to help you was to do that so I did it.  Okay how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat.
37263,m105,jackie brown,L312936,u1598,ORDELL,Answer the question nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
37264,m105,jackie brown,L312935,u1598,ORDELL,You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
37266,m105,jackie brown,L312933,u1598,ORDELL,Well if you owe me git your ass in the trunk.
37268,m105,jackie brown,L312931,u1598,ORDELL,Well my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful peanuthead niggas outta jail but I do it --
37270,m105,jackie brown,L312929,u1598,ORDELL,I can't believe you do me this way.
37272,m105,jackie brown,L312927,u1598,ORDELL,You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
37274,m105,jackie brown,L312925,u1598,ORDELL,We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
37276,m105,jackie brown,L312923,u1598,ORDELL,What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
37279,m105,jackie brown,L312919,u1598,ORDELL,Let me finish. Can I finish?
37281,m105,jackie brown,L312917,u1598,ORDELL,I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you backup.
37283,m105,jackie brown,L312915,u1598,ORDELL,Well it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
37285,m105,jackie brown,L312913,u1598,ORDELL,Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look I gotta problem. I need help and you can help me.
37287,m105,jackie brown,L312911,u1598,ORDELL,A bit.
37289,m105,jackie brown,L312909,u1598,ORDELL,I need a favor.
37291,m105,jackie brown,L312907,u1598,ORDELL,Look I hate to be the kinda nigga does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
37293,m105,jackie brown,L312905,u1598,ORDELL,Naw man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
37296,m105,jackie brown,L312900,u1598,ORDELL,Three years. That crime's old man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
37298,m105,jackie brown,L312898,u1598,ORDELL,How old is that machine gun shit?
37300,m105,jackie brown,L312896,u1598,ORDELL,Naw man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
37302,m105,jackie brown,L312894,u1598,ORDELL,You see it works like this. You get your ass in trouble I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya nigga it's steady work.
37304,m105,jackie brown,L312891,u1598,ORDELL,Who?
37306,m105,jackie brown,L312889,u1598,ORDELL,Who was there for your ass?
37308,m105,jackie brown,L314212,u1595,MAX,I told Jackie and Jackie said you wanted him.
37310,m105,jackie brown,L314210,u1595,MAX,I found out.
37312,m105,jackie brown,L314208,u1595,MAX,I went to give him his refund so he wouldn't have to come here.
37314,m105,jackie brown,L314206,u1595,MAX,In his inside coat pocket.
37316,m105,jackie brown,L314075,u1597,NICOLET,Sure.
37319,m105,jackie brown,L313639,u1597,NICOLET,The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination one-hundred- dollar bills. Now I'm counting it.
37320,m105,jackie brown,L313638,u1597,NICOLET,Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
37323,m105,jackie brown,L313344,u1597,NICOLET,She knows it's my case?
37325,m105,jackie brown,L313342,u1597,NICOLET,What's she willing to give us?
37327,m105,jackie brown,L313340,u1597,NICOLET,What's she want?
37329,m105,jackie brown,L313338,u1597,NICOLET,She sound scared?
37331,m105,jackie brown,L313336,u1597,NICOLET,What's going on?
37332,m105,jackie brown,L313329,u1597,NICOLET,Hey Jackie.
37334,m105,jackie brown,L312994,u1597,NICOLET,Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?
37336,m105,jackie brown,L312992,u1597,NICOLET,You got a good lawyer?
37337,m105,jackie brown,L312983,u1597,NICOLET,That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
37339,m105,jackie brown,L313645,u1593,JACKIE,But you're not going to stop her?
37341,m105,jackie brown,L313643,u1593,JACKIE,He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
37343,m105,jackie brown,L313641,u1593,JACKIE,Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
37345,m105,jackie brown,L313631,u1593,JACKIE,Fine.
37347,m105,jackie brown,L313367,u1593,JACKIE,Can you do it or not?
37349,m105,jackie brown,L313357,u1593,JACKIE,'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
37351,m105,jackie brown,L313353,u1593,JACKIE,Help you get Ordell Robbie.
37354,m105,jackie brown,L313331,u1593,JACKIE,Take your time.
37356,m105,jackie brown,L313022,u1593,JACKIE,I'm tellin' you I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
37358,m105,jackie brown,L313011,u1593,JACKIE,That's my diet shit.
37360,m105,jackie brown,L313008,u1593,JACKIE,Beauty products.
37362,m105,jackie brown,L313006,u1593,JACKIE,My pocketbook.
37364,m105,jackie brown,L313004,u1593,JACKIE,Help yourself.
37366,m105,jackie brown,L313000,u1593,JACKIE,I'm not a loser.
37367,m105,jackie brown,L312990,u1593,JACKIE,Arrest me.
37369,m105,jackie brown,L312987,u1593,JACKIE,I'm not saying another word.
37372,m105,jackie brown,L312979,u1593,JACKIE,Suspicion of what?
37373,m105,jackie brown,L312977,u1593,JACKIE,Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
37375,m105,jackie brown,L312975,u1593,JACKIE,I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
37376,m105,jackie brown,L312973,u1593,JACKIE,The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
37378,m105,jackie brown,L314256,u1593,JACKIE,Are you scared of me?
37379,m105,jackie brown,L314255,u1595,MAX,I'm just tired in general.
37380,m105,jackie brown,L314254,u1593,JACKIE,I thought you were tired of your business?
37381,m105,jackie brown,L314253,u1595,MAX,Thank you for saying that but no. My business.
37382,m105,jackie brown,L314252,u1593,JACKIE,Sure I can't twist your arm?
37383,m105,jackie brown,L314251,u1595,MAX,Thanks but you have a good time.
37384,m105,jackie brown,L314250,u1593,JACKIE,Wanna go?
37385,m105,jackie brown,L314248,u1593,JACKIE,Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
37386,m105,jackie brown,L314247,u1595,MAX,Madrid or Barcelona?
37387,m105,jackie brown,L314246,u1593,JACKIE,Spain.
37388,m105,jackie brown,L314245,u1595,MAX,Where're you going?
37389,m105,jackie brown,L314244,u1595,MAX,You'll get over that.
37390,m105,jackie brown,L314243,u1593,JACKIE,I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
37391,m105,jackie brown,L314242,u1593,JACKIE,Do you blame yourself for helping me?
37392,m105,jackie brown,L314241,u1595,MAX,I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
37393,m105,jackie brown,L314240,u1593,JACKIE,We're partners.
37394,m105,jackie brown,L314239,u1595,MAX,I know.
37395,m105,jackie brown,L314238,u1593,JACKIE,I never lied to you.
37396,m105,jackie brown,L314237,u1595,MAX,I didn't say you did.
37397,m105,jackie brown,L314236,u1593,JACKIE,I didn't use you Max.
37398,m105,jackie brown,L314235,u1595,MAX,Not after they're dead.
37399,m105,jackie brown,L314234,u1593,JACKIE,They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box the keys were under the seat... What's a matter haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
37400,m105,jackie brown,L314233,u1595,MAX,That's Ordell's.
37401,m105,jackie brown,L314232,u1593,JACKIE,I told him I might.
37402,m105,jackie brown,L314231,u1595,MAX,Did you tell him you were leaving?
37403,m105,jackie brown,L314229,u1595,MAX,What's he doing?
37404,m105,jackie brown,L314228,u1593,JACKIE,I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
37405,m105,jackie brown,L314225,u1595,MAX,I'm sure.
37406,m105,jackie brown,L314224,u1593,JACKIE,You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
37407,m105,jackie brown,L314223,u1595,MAX,I hesitated taking that much.
37408,m105,jackie brown,L314222,u1593,JACKIE,Only this isn't a bail bond Max.
37409,m105,jackie brown,L314221,u1593,JACKIE,Yeah your fee. I had to figure that out since there wasn't no note.
37410,m105,jackie brown,L314220,u1595,MAX,Less ten percent.
37411,m105,jackie brown,L314219,u1593,JACKIE,I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
37412,m105,jackie brown,L314137,u1593,JACKIE,Well we don't let that happen now do we?
37413,m105,jackie brown,L314136,u1595,MAX,What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
37414,m105,jackie brown,L314135,u1593,JACKIE,He's already there.
37415,m105,jackie brown,L314134,u1595,MAX,We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
37416,m105,jackie brown,L314133,u1593,JACKIE,Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
37417,m105,jackie brown,L314132,u1595,MAX,What do you tell Nicolet?
37418,m105,jackie brown,L314131,u1593,JACKIE,I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
37419,m105,jackie brown,L314130,u1595,MAX,Why?
37420,m105,jackie brown,L314129,u1593,JACKIE,Tell him I want to give him his money.
37421,m105,jackie brown,L314128,u1595,MAX,Tell him you want to see him?
37422,m105,jackie brown,L314127,u1593,JACKIE,Uh-huh.
37423,m105,jackie brown,L314126,u1595,MAX,Set him up.
37424,m105,jackie brown,L314125,u1593,JACKIE,Get Ordell to come to your office.
37425,m105,jackie brown,L314124,u1595,MAX,So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
37426,m105,jackie brown,L314123,u1593,JACKIE,It never was so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look Ray more or less believes my story and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
37427,m105,jackie brown,L314122,u1595,MAX,It's not that simple.
37428,m105,jackie brown,L314121,u1593,JACKIE,That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine who are they gonna believe?
37429,m105,jackie brown,L314120,u1595,MAX,Everybody wants him he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in he's gonna name you as an accessory.
37430,m105,jackie brown,L314119,u1593,JACKIE,Ray wants him.
37431,m105,jackie brown,L314118,u1595,MAX,On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
37432,m105,jackie brown,L314117,u1593,JACKIE,He's liable to shoot you.
37433,m105,jackie brown,L314116,u1595,MAX,People talk to Winston. He's street same as them they trust him. They get busted they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
37434,m105,jackie brown,L314115,u1593,JACKIE,How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
37435,m105,jackie brown,L314114,u1595,MAX,All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
37436,m105,jackie brown,L314113,u1593,JACKIE,How'd you find out?
37437,m105,jackie brown,L313851,u1593,JACKIE,Well a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
37438,m105,jackie brown,L313850,u1595,MAX,In a dress.
37439,m105,jackie brown,L313849,u1593,JACKIE,That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
37440,m105,jackie brown,L313848,u1595,MAX,You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
37441,m105,jackie brown,L313847,u1593,JACKIE,Yeah but I'm not in jail and I tried.
37442,m105,jackie brown,L313846,u1595,MAX,Then you're out and you get nothing.
37443,m105,jackie brown,L313845,u1593,JACKIE,Not really. If he finds it I say Mr. Walker put the money in and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
37444,m105,jackie brown,L313844,u1595,MAX,You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
37445,m105,jackie brown,L313843,u1593,JACKIE,He won't -- I mean he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
37446,m105,jackie brown,L313842,u1595,MAX,What if he checks it?
37447,m105,jackie brown,L313841,u1593,JACKIE,In the bag underneath.
37448,m105,jackie brown,L313840,u1595,MAX,Where's the rest of it?
37449,m105,jackie brown,L313839,u1593,JACKIE,Well you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
37450,m105,jackie brown,L313838,u1595,MAX,But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
37451,m105,jackie brown,L313837,u1593,JACKIE,Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
37452,m105,jackie brown,L313836,u1595,MAX,It'll be more than that.
37453,m105,jackie brown,L313834,u1593,JACKIE,All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
37454,m105,jackie brown,L313833,u1595,MAX,You know a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
37455,m105,jackie brown,L313832,u1593,JACKIE,Oh yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
37456,m105,jackie brown,L313831,u1595,MAX,Do you think they bought it?
37457,m105,jackie brown,L313830,u1593,JACKIE,I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
37458,m105,jackie brown,L313677,u1593,JACKIE,That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this Max I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
37459,m105,jackie brown,L313676,u1595,MAX,You're rationalizing.
37460,m105,jackie brown,L313654,u1593,JACKIE,It may be evidence once they get their hands on it but right now it's only money.
37461,m105,jackie brown,L313653,u1595,MAX,The feds. It's evidence.
37462,m105,jackie brown,L313627,u1593,JACKIE,What if I've figured a way?
37463,m105,jackie brown,L313626,u1595,MAX,Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
37464,m105,jackie brown,L313625,u1595,MAX,I believe I said I'd be tempted.
37465,m105,jackie brown,L313624,u1593,JACKIE,If you had a chance unemployed now to walk off with a half-million dollars would you take it?
37466,m105,jackie brown,L313623,u1595,MAX,Which one?
37467,m105,jackie brown,L313622,u1593,JACKIE,I'm not sure you answered my question.
37468,m105,jackie brown,L313621,u1595,MAX,More or less.
37469,m105,jackie brown,L313620,u1593,JACKIE,And is that it?
37470,m105,jackie brown,L313618,u1593,JACKIE,Did you do it that night?
37471,m105,jackie brown,L313617,u1595,MAX,That's my job.
37472,m105,jackie brown,L313616,u1593,JACKIE,You do that?
37473,m105,jackie brown,L313615,u1595,MAX,Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated cuff him take 'em to County.
37474,m105,jackie brown,L313614,u1593,JACKIE,What do you do when he comes home?
37475,m105,jackie brown,L313613,u1595,MAX,And went to this guy's house in El Monte and I waited for him.
37476,m105,jackie brown,L313612,u1595,MAX,Got another gun and a stun gun...
37477,m105,jackie brown,L313609,u1595,MAX,Uh-huh.
37478,m105,jackie brown,L313608,u1593,JACKIE,Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
37479,m105,jackie brown,L313607,u1595,MAX,Yeah that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house so I sneak in wait for him to come home.
37480,m105,jackie brown,L313606,u1593,JACKIE,The day you got me out of jail?
37481,m105,jackie brown,L313605,u1595,MAX,Hi I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
37482,m105,jackie brown,L313604,u1595,MAX,It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.
37483,m105,jackie brown,L313603,u1593,JACKIE,When did you decide?
37484,m105,jackie brown,L313602,u1595,MAX,A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
37485,m105,jackie brown,L313601,u1593,JACKIE,Why?
37486,m105,jackie brown,L313600,u1595,MAX,I have to stand behind all my active bonds but I'm not writing any new ones.
37487,m105,jackie brown,L313599,u1595,MAX,Okay sure. I might be tempted. Especially now since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
37488,m105,jackie brown,L313598,u1593,JACKIE,You're avoiding the question.
37489,m105,jackie brown,L313597,u1595,MAX,A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
37490,m105,jackie brown,L313596,u1593,JACKIE,You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
37491,m105,jackie brown,L313595,u1595,MAX,If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money would I take it?
37492,m105,jackie brown,L313594,u1593,JACKIE,No I mean you right now. Not it you were somebody else.
37493,m105,jackie brown,L313593,u1595,MAX,What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
37494,m105,jackie brown,L313592,u1593,JACKIE,What about you Max?
37495,m105,jackie brown,L313591,u1595,MAX,No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
37496,m105,jackie brown,L313590,u1593,JACKIE,He tries to act cool.
37497,m105,jackie brown,L313589,u1595,MAX,Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
37498,m105,jackie brown,L313588,u1593,JACKIE,He weren't bullshittin' either 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
37499,m105,jackie brown,L313587,u1595,MAX,You know some interesting people.
37500,m105,jackie brown,L313586,u1593,JACKIE,Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
37501,m105,jackie brown,L313585,u1595,MAX,Has he hinted around?
37502,m105,jackie brown,L313584,u1593,JACKIE,You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
37503,m105,jackie brown,L313583,u1595,MAX,I see.
37504,m105,jackie brown,L313582,u1593,JACKIE,He's setting me up to make a proposition.
37505,m105,jackie brown,L313581,u1595,MAX,I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
37506,m105,jackie brown,L313580,u1593,JACKIE,Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
37507,m105,jackie brown,L313579,u1595,MAX,You think he's got a thing for you?
37508,m105,jackie brown,L313578,u1593,JACKIE,I know I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
37509,m105,jackie brown,L313577,u1595,MAX,I called you last night.
37510,m105,jackie brown,L313576,u1593,JACKIE,Yeah we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
37511,m105,jackie brown,L313575,u1595,MAX,He was here?
37512,m105,jackie brown,L313574,u1593,JACKIE,I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
37513,m105,jackie brown,L313573,u1595,MAX,Will Ordell go for that?
37514,m105,jackie brown,L313572,u1595,MAX,Sit down leave the bag under the table?
37515,m105,jackie brown,L313571,u1593,JACKIE,Right around here in the food court.
37516,m105,jackie brown,L313570,u1595,MAX,Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
37517,m105,jackie brown,L313569,u1593,JACKIE,He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved I want to stage it. You know make it look more intriguing like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
37518,m105,jackie brown,L313568,u1595,MAX,You don't actually do it that way?
37519,m105,jackie brown,L313567,u1593,JACKIE,Yea but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
37520,m105,jackie brown,L313566,u1595,MAX,Bring the money in and they follow it?
37521,m105,jackie brown,L313565,u1593,JACKIE,They seem to like the idea.
37522,m105,jackie brown,L313564,u1595,MAX,You talk them into it?
37523,m105,jackie brown,L313563,u1593,JACKIE,I go back to work tomorrow.
37524,m105,jackie brown,L313562,u1595,MAX,What're you a bag lady?
37525,m105,jackie brown,L313561,u1595,MAX,I don't care.
37526,m105,jackie brown,L313560,u1593,JACKIE,How old's Annette?
37527,m105,jackie brown,L313559,u1595,MAX,I'm old enough to be her father.
37528,m105,jackie brown,L313558,u1593,JACKIE,Why?
37529,m105,jackie brown,L313557,u1595,MAX,She's adorable. But I had to end it.
37530,m105,jackie brown,L313555,u1595,MAX,Sandra Bullock. You know her?
37531,m105,jackie brown,L313554,u1593,JACKIE,Who was your girl before Annette?
37532,m105,jackie brown,L313552,u1595,MAX,For now. These relationships never last too long.
37533,m105,jackie brown,L313551,u1593,JACKIE,And Annette's it for you?
37534,m105,jackie brown,L313550,u1595,MAX,Well I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men but as or myself and a few of my friends that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
37535,m105,jackie brown,L313549,u1593,JACKIE,Does it happen to all men?
37536,m105,jackie brown,L313546,u1595,MAX,No...  ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.
37537,m105,jackie brown,L313545,u1593,JACKIE,Oh are you? Does she know that?
37538,m105,jackie brown,L313544,u1595,MAX,Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
37539,m105,jackie brown,L313543,u1593,JACKIE,How was it?
37540,m105,jackie brown,L313541,u1593,JACKIE,What'd ya see?
37541,m105,jackie brown,L313540,u1595,MAX,Catching a movie.
37542,m105,jackie brown,L313539,u1593,JACKIE,I know ignoring me. What're you up to?
37543,m105,jackie brown,L313538,u1595,MAX,I walked right past you.
37544,m105,jackie brown,L313537,u1593,JACKIE,Surprise.
37545,m105,jackie brown,L313536,u1595,MAX,Well hello.
37546,m105,jackie brown,L313326,u1593,JACKIE,Well I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand with retirement benefits ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
37547,m105,jackie brown,L313325,u1595,MAX,Fifteen thousand.
37548,m105,jackie brown,L313324,u1593,JACKIE,I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
37549,m105,jackie brown,L313323,u1595,MAX,Does something else worry you?
37550,m105,jackie brown,L313321,u1593,JACKIE,Yeah.
37551,m105,jackie brown,L313320,u1595,MAX,Bigger?
37552,m105,jackie brown,L313319,u1593,JACKIE,My ass ain't the same.
37553,m105,jackie brown,L313317,u1595,MAX,You know I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
37554,m105,jackie brown,L313316,u1593,JACKIE,It's different with men.
37555,m105,jackie brown,L313315,u1595,MAX,I'm fine with it or I wouldn't of done it I did it to feel better about myself and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
37556,m105,jackie brown,L313314,u1593,JACKIE,How'd you feel about it?
37557,m105,jackie brown,L313313,u1595,MAX,Okay I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
37558,m105,jackie brown,L313312,u1593,JACKIE,Really?
37559,m105,jackie brown,L313311,u1595,MAX,It's not really something I think about.
37560,m105,jackie brown,L313310,u1593,JACKIE,I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
37561,m105,jackie brown,L313309,u1595,MAX,You're not old. You look great.
37562,m105,jackie brown,L313308,u1593,JACKIE,How do you feel about getting old?
37563,m105,jackie brown,L313307,u1593,JACKIE,I ain't goin' to jail and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
37564,m105,jackie brown,L313306,u1595,MAX,It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
37565,m105,jackie brown,L313305,u1593,JACKIE,If I get let off. Otherwise fuck 'em.
37566,m105,jackie brown,L313304,u1595,MAX,You're gonna offer to set him up?
37567,m105,jackie brown,L313303,u1593,JACKIE,Same way I been doin' but first they got to let me go back to work.
37568,m105,jackie brown,L313302,u1595,MAX,How do you get it out?
37569,m105,jackie brown,L313300,u1595,MAX,No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
37570,m105,jackie brown,L313299,u1593,JACKIE,He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
37571,m105,jackie brown,L313298,u1595,MAX,Why?
37572,m105,jackie brown,L313297,u1593,JACKIE,He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
37573,m105,jackie brown,L313296,u1593,JACKIE,We talked.
37574,m105,jackie brown,L313295,u1595,MAX,What?... What'd you do?
37575,m105,jackie brown,L313294,u1593,JACKIE,He came by.
37576,m105,jackie brown,L313293,u1595,MAX,He called you?
37577,m105,jackie brown,L313292,u1593,JACKIE,He told me last night.
37578,m105,jackie brown,L313291,u1595,MAX,How'd you find that out?
37579,m105,jackie brown,L313290,u1593,JACKIE,It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
37580,m105,jackie brown,L313289,u1595,MAX,Well if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you that'll only interest him up to a point.
37581,m105,jackie brown,L313288,u1593,JACKIE,I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
37582,m105,jackie brown,L313287,u1595,MAX,What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
37583,m105,jackie brown,L313286,u1593,JACKIE,I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
37584,m105,jackie brown,L313285,u1595,MAX,Are you?
37585,m105,jackie brown,L313284,u1593,JACKIE,I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows I'm still available.
37586,m105,jackie brown,L313283,u1595,MAX,It's nice.
37587,m105,jackie brown,L313282,u1593,JACKIE,'74 I think.
37588,m105,jackie brown,L313281,u1595,MAX,'76?
37589,m105,jackie brown,L313280,u1593,JACKIE,The Delfonics.
37590,m105,jackie brown,L313279,u1595,MAX,Who is this?
37591,m105,jackie brown,L313278,u1593,JACKIE,Uh-huh.
37592,m105,jackie brown,L313277,u1595,MAX,This is pretty.
37593,m105,jackie brown,L313274,u1593,JACKIE,I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
37594,m105,jackie brown,L313273,u1595,MAX,You never got into the whole CD revolution?
37595,m105,jackie brown,L313272,u1595,MAX,It looks nice.
37596,m105,jackie brown,L313271,u1593,JACKIE,I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
37597,m105,jackie brown,L313270,u1595,MAX,Sure.
37598,m105,jackie brown,L313269,u1593,JACKIE,Want to hear some music?
37599,m105,jackie brown,L313268,u1593,JACKIE,Yeah.
37600,m105,jackie brown,L313267,u1595,MAX,Somebody loan it to you?
37601,m105,jackie brown,L313265,u1595,MAX,You went out this morning and bought a gun.
37602,m105,jackie brown,L313264,u1593,JACKIE,What I couldn't hear you?
37603,m105,jackie brown,L313263,u1595,MAX,You went out this morning and bought a gun?
37604,m105,jackie brown,L313262,u1593,JACKIE,Thanks but I have my own now.
37605,m105,jackie brown,L313260,u1595,MAX,Black's fine.
37606,m105,jackie brown,L313259,u1593,JACKIE,I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
37607,m105,jackie brown,L313258,u1595,MAX,You get a chance to use it?
37608,m105,jackie brown,L313257,u1593,JACKIE,I am. Have a seat.
37609,m105,jackie brown,L313256,u1595,MAX,If you're having some.
37610,m105,jackie brown,L313185,u1593,JACKIE,I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
37611,m105,jackie brown,L313184,u1595,MAX,What'dya think?
37612,m105,jackie brown,L313183,u1595,MAX,Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail don't you?
37613,m105,jackie brown,L313182,u1593,JACKIE,But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
37614,m105,jackie brown,L313181,u1595,MAX,Well Jackie you got caught you're gonna have to give 'em something.
37615,m105,jackie brown,L313180,u1593,JACKIE,Yeah if I cooperate.
37616,m105,jackie brown,L313179,u1595,MAX,Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
37617,m105,jackie brown,L313178,u1593,JACKIE,Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job I can't hire a lawyer.
37618,m105,jackie brown,L313177,u1595,MAX,If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law why not pack a hundred grand?
37619,m105,jackie brown,L313176,u1593,JACKIE,That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars and his friend Mr. Walker in Mexico gave me the envelope.
37620,m105,jackie brown,L313175,u1595,MAX,Cash poor?
37621,m105,jackie brown,L313174,u1593,JACKIE,It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money but don't have cash?
37622,m105,jackie brown,L313173,u1595,MAX,He's got that kinda money?
37623,m105,jackie brown,L313172,u1593,JACKIE,With ten thousand? Nine.
37624,m105,jackie brown,L313171,u1595,MAX,How many trips did you make?
37625,m105,jackie brown,L313170,u1593,JACKIE,I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit so I never brought more than that.
37626,m105,jackie brown,L313169,u1593,JACKIE,I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
37627,m105,jackie brown,L313168,u1595,MAX,'Cause if he busted you you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell make a case then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
37628,m105,jackie brown,L313167,u1593,JACKIE,It was the other guy who busted me.
37629,m105,jackie brown,L313166,u1595,MAX,He's the one who wants you.
37630,m105,jackie brown,L313165,u1593,JACKIE,Ray Nicolet with Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms.
37631,m105,jackie brown,L313164,u1595,MAX,No you didn't. What branch?
37632,m105,jackie brown,L313163,u1593,JACKIE,I didn't?
37633,m105,jackie brown,L313162,u1595,MAX,You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D. but you didn't mention the Federal.
37634,m105,jackie brown,L313161,u1593,JACKIE,The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
37635,m105,jackie brown,L313160,u1595,MAX,Same as you. Ten thousand.
37636,m105,jackie brown,L313159,u1593,JACKIE,Ordell pick up his bond?
37637,m105,jackie brown,L313158,u1595,MAX,I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
37638,m105,jackie brown,L313157,u1593,JACKIE,That's him. How do you know 'em?
37639,m105,jackie brown,L313156,u1595,MAX,That would be Beaumont Livingston.
37640,m105,jackie brown,L313153,u1593,JACKIE,Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
37641,m105,jackie brown,L313152,u1595,MAX,What did they want to know?
37642,m105,jackie brown,L313151,u1593,JACKIE,I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
37643,m105,jackie brown,L313150,u1595,MAX,They wanted you to tell them what you know.
37644,m105,jackie brown,L313148,u1595,MAX,You know who put the dope in your bag?
37645,m105,jackie brown,L313147,u1593,JACKIE,Sure.
37646,m105,jackie brown,L313146,u1595,MAX,But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession a few months of County time and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
37647,m105,jackie brown,L313145,u1593,JACKIE,Shit.
37648,m105,jackie brown,L313144,u1595,MAX,I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
37649,m105,jackie brown,L313143,u1593,JACKIE,So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation maybe. Or I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
37650,m105,jackie brown,L313142,u1595,MAX,What have they told you?
37651,m105,jackie brown,L313141,u1595,MAX,I am as a matter of fact.
37652,m105,jackie brown,L313140,u1593,JACKIE,You're not tired of it?
37653,m105,jackie brown,L313139,u1595,MAX,You know I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want I can help you look at your options.
37654,m105,jackie brown,L313138,u1593,JACKIE,She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer find out what my options are.
37655,m105,jackie brown,L313137,u1595,MAX,Was she helpful?
37656,m105,jackie brown,L313136,u1593,JACKIE,Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
37657,m105,jackie brown,L313135,u1595,MAX,What's your brand?
37658,m105,jackie brown,L313134,u1593,JACKIE,That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
37659,m105,jackie brown,L313133,u1595,MAX,Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
37660,m105,jackie brown,L313132,u1593,JACKIE,You gain weight?
37661,m105,jackie brown,L313130,u1595,MAX,Great.
37662,m105,jackie brown,L313129,u1593,JACKIE,'Cause I look like I just got outta jail that's why. You droppin' me off at home right? There's a place by me.
37663,m105,jackie brown,L313128,u1595,MAX,Why does it need to be dark?
37664,m105,jackie brown,L313127,u1593,JACKIE,That doesn't sound dark.
37665,m105,jackie brown,L313126,u1595,MAX,It's kind of a sports bar
37666,m105,jackie brown,L313125,u1593,JACKIE,Is it dark?
37667,m105,jackie brown,L313124,u1595,MAX,We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
37668,m105,jackie brown,L313123,u1593,JACKIE,I'd love one but not there.
37669,m105,jackie brown,L313122,u1595,MAX,I thought you might want a drink?
37670,m105,jackie brown,L313121,u1593,JACKIE,Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
37671,m105,jackie brown,L313120,u1595,MAX,It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
37672,m105,jackie brown,L313119,u1593,JACKIE,I don't think so.
37673,m105,jackie brown,L313118,u1595,MAX,Sure ever been to the Riverbottom?
37674,m105,jackie brown,L313117,u1593,JACKIE,Can we stop for cigarettes?
37675,m105,jackie brown,L313116,u1595,MAX,In cash.
37676,m105,jackie brown,L313115,u1593,JACKIE,Who put up my bond? Ordell?
37677,m105,jackie brown,L313114,u1595,MAX,You're serious?
37678,m105,jackie brown,L313113,u1593,JACKIE,Can I see your I.D.?
37679,m105,jackie brown,L313112,u1595,MAX,I gave you my card there.
37680,m105,jackie brown,L313111,u1595,MAX,Who do you think I am?
37681,m105,jackie brown,L313110,u1593,JACKIE,Are you really a bail bondsman?
37682,m105,jackie brown,L313109,u1593,JACKIE,Okay.
37683,m105,jackie brown,L313108,u1595,MAX,I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
37685,m105,jackie brown,L313031,u1593,JACKIE,If I don't cooperate?
37687,m105,jackie brown,L313029,u1593,JACKIE,What if I plead guilty?
37689,m105,jackie brown,L313027,u1593,JACKIE,Who's side are you on?
37691,m105,jackie brown,L313025,u1593,JACKIE,You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
37692,m105,jackie brown,L313674,u1593,JACKIE,Well Sheronda it was nice talking to you.
37694,m105,jackie brown,L313672,u1593,JACKIE,You know what's in the bag you're taking?
37696,m105,jackie brown,L313670,u1593,JACKIE,Then you don't see him for a few days?
37698,m105,jackie brown,L313668,u1593,JACKIE,Not every day?
37700,m105,jackie brown,L313666,u1593,JACKIE,Do you live together?
37702,m105,jackie brown,L314084,u1597,NICOLET,I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her which goes a long way backing up your story.
37703,m105,jackie brown,L314083,u1593,JACKIE,Do you think I took some of that money?
37704,m105,jackie brown,L314082,u1597,NICOLET,What about you?
37705,m105,jackie brown,L314081,u1593,JACKIE,What about me?
37706,m105,jackie brown,L314080,u1597,NICOLET,We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
37707,m105,jackie brown,L314079,u1593,JACKIE,So what happens now?
37708,m105,jackie brown,L314078,u1597,NICOLET,We were and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
37709,m105,jackie brown,L314077,u1593,JACKIE,I thought you were watching him.
37710,m105,jackie brown,L314076,u1597,NICOLET,Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
37711,m105,jackie brown,L314073,u1597,NICOLET,I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
37712,m105,jackie brown,L314072,u1593,JACKIE,If it'll make you happy.
37713,m105,jackie brown,L314071,u1597,NICOLET,You'd take a polygraph on it?
37714,m105,jackie brown,L314070,u1593,JACKIE,I have no idea.
37715,m105,jackie brown,L314069,u1597,NICOLET,It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
37716,m105,jackie brown,L314068,u1593,JACKIE,I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
37717,m105,jackie brown,L314067,u1597,NICOLET,This guy with Melanie that was Louis Gara?
37718,m105,jackie brown,L314066,u1597,NICOLET,We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
37719,m105,jackie brown,L314065,u1593,JACKIE,Not in the fitting room.
37720,m105,jackie brown,L314064,u1597,NICOLET,There was a guy with Melanie?
37721,m105,jackie brown,L314063,u1593,JACKIE,I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore 'cause that's where you were last time but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that did you? I knew I was under surveillance so when I couldn't spot anybody I started yelling.
37722,m105,jackie brown,L314062,u1597,NICOLET,What did you do after that?
37723,m105,jackie brown,L314061,u1593,JACKIE,I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
37724,m105,jackie brown,L314060,u1597,NICOLET,You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
37725,m105,jackie brown,L314059,u1593,JACKIE,She didn't give me one. I told you before Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in grabs the shopping bag and takes off. What am I supposed to do go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
37726,m105,jackie brown,L314058,u1597,NICOLET,Where's the bag she gave you?
37727,m105,jackie brown,L314057,u1593,JACKIE,Because I didn't have it. Ray I swear Melanie came in and grabbed it.  And someone killed her for it.
37728,m105,jackie brown,L314056,u1597,NICOLET,But you didn't do that.
37729,m105,jackie brown,L314055,u1593,JACKIE,I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit see if I liked it. If I did get them to wrap it up and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda give her the bag with fifty thousand and go home.
37730,m105,jackie brown,L314054,u1597,NICOLET,You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind you'd wait till after.
37731,m105,jackie brown,L314053,u1593,JACKIE,I thought I did.
37732,m105,jackie brown,L313883,u1593,JACKIE,Si.
37733,m105,jackie brown,L313882,u1597,NICOLET,I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
37734,m105,jackie brown,L313881,u1593,JACKIE,How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
37735,m105,jackie brown,L313880,u1597,NICOLET,Yeah well it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid now.
37736,m105,jackie brown,L313879,u1593,JACKIE,That would be one point of view.
37737,m105,jackie brown,L313878,u1597,NICOLET,After all it don't belong to nobody right?
37738,m105,jackie brown,L313877,u1593,JACKIE,Yes. All those things are true.
37739,m105,jackie brown,L313876,u1597,NICOLET,If I did I'd have to give you one wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us right?
37740,m105,jackie brown,L313875,u1593,JACKIE,Uh-huh.
37741,m105,jackie brown,L313874,u1597,NICOLET,What? To put one of these in my pocket?
37742,m105,jackie brown,L313873,u1593,JACKIE,Ever been tempted?
37743,m105,jackie brown,L313870,u1593,JACKIE,I never have. It's not my money.
37744,m105,jackie brown,L313869,u1597,NICOLET,You didn't count it?
37745,m105,jackie brown,L313868,u1593,JACKIE,I was told ten thousand in each pack.
37746,m105,jackie brown,L313867,u1597,NICOLET,That's fifty thousand huh? It doesn't look like that much.
37747,m105,jackie brown,L313863,u1597,NICOLET,Oh that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
37748,m105,jackie brown,L313862,u1593,JACKIE,We could if I'm not in jail.
37749,m105,jackie brown,L313861,u1597,NICOLET,Well it's true isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
37750,m105,jackie brown,L313860,u1593,JACKIE,You said that the last time.
37751,m105,jackie brown,L313829,u1593,JACKIE,Right. Everything's the same except one change...
37752,m105,jackie brown,L313828,u1597,NICOLET,Well this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
37753,m105,jackie brown,L313827,u1593,JACKIE,Uh-huh.
37754,m105,jackie brown,L313826,u1597,NICOLET,But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
37755,m105,jackie brown,L313825,u1593,JACKIE,She didn't say.
37756,m105,jackie brown,L313824,u1597,NICOLET,Was she there?
37757,m105,jackie brown,L313823,u1593,JACKIE,Uh-huh.
37758,m105,jackie brown,L313822,u1597,NICOLET,She told you that?
37759,m105,jackie brown,L313821,u1593,JACKIE,I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
37760,m105,jackie brown,L313820,u1597,NICOLET,What did you say?
37761,m105,jackie brown,L313819,u1593,JACKIE,I'm sure that was the idea.
37762,m105,jackie brown,L313818,u1597,NICOLET,And splittin' with her?
37763,m105,jackie brown,L313817,u1593,JACKIE,It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything but she's not part of it and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
37764,m105,jackie brown,L313816,u1597,NICOLET,What's her story?
37765,m105,jackie brown,L313815,u1593,JACKIE,White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.

37835,m105,jackie brown,L313782,u1593,JACKIE,That coke was yours wasn't it?
37836,m105,jackie brown,L313781,u1596,MELANIE,Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.

37838,m105,jackie brown,L313778,u1596,MELANIE,This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
37839,m105,jackie brown,L313777,u1593,JACKIE,How long you been with Ordell?
37840,m105,jackie brown,L313775,u1596,MELANIE,Gimme one anyway.

37853,m105,jackie brown,L313751,u1593,JACKIE,Give it to the bail bondsman Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
37854,m105,jackie brown,L313750,u1598,ORDELL,We're partners Baby sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
37855,m105,jackie brown,L313749,u1593,JACKIE,And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
37856,m105,jackie brown,L313748,u1598,ORDELL,Well I've been trusting you all this time haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
37857,m105,jackie brown,L313747,u1593,JACKIE,If I wasn't this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
37858,m105,jackie brown,L313746,u1598,ORDELL,That works on my nerves you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
37859,m105,jackie brown,L313745,u1593,JACKIE,Ray the A.T.F. guy.
37860,m105,jackie brown,L313744,u1598,ORDELL,Who's paging you?
37861,m105,jackie brown,L313742,u1598,ORDELL,I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign.
37862,m105,jackie brown,L313741,u1593,JACKIE,Where you gonna be during all this?
37863,m105,jackie brown,L313740,u1598,ORDELL,So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
37864,m105,jackie brown,L313737,u1593,JACKIE,The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
37865,m105,jackie brown,L313736,u1598,ORDELL,She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
37866,m105,jackie brown,L313735,u1593,JACKIE,Designer clothes.
37867,m105,jackie brown,L313734,u1598,ORDELL,She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
37868,m105,jackie brown,L313733,u1593,JACKIE,Right the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
37869,m105,jackie brown,L313732,u1598,ORDELL,No you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
37870,m105,jackie brown,L313729,u1598,ORDELL,I told her this is a game us rich folks play exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
37871,m105,jackie brown,L313728,u1593,JACKIE,What does she think she's gettin?
37872,m105,jackie brown,L313727,u1598,ORDELL,She don't know shit about the money.
37873,m105,jackie brown,L313726,u1593,JACKIE,Are you sure she don't know about the money?
37874,m105,jackie brown,L313725,u1598,ORDELL,She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
37875,m105,jackie brown,L313724,u1593,JACKIE,It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
37876,m105,jackie brown,L313723,u1598,ORDELL,Man I don't like that part.
37877,m105,jackie brown,L313722,u1593,JACKIE,Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
37878,m105,jackie brown,L313718,u1593,JACKIE,Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
37879,m105,jackie brown,L313717,u1598,ORDELL,Now hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
37880,m105,jackie brown,L313716,u1593,JACKIE,I know but I hung around 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
37881,m105,jackie brown,L313715,u1598,ORDELL,Well you weren't supposed to be there.
37882,m105,jackie brown,L313714,u1593,JACKIE,I was there I saw her do it.
37883,m105,jackie brown,L313713,u1598,ORDELL,How do you know she did that?
37884,m105,jackie brown,L313712,u1593,JACKIE,Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
37885,m105,jackie brown,L313711,u1598,ORDELL,What the hell you talkin' bout?
37886,m105,jackie brown,L313710,u1593,JACKIE,I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out or we don't do it at all.
37887,m105,jackie brown,L313709,u1593,JACKIE,I need to talk to you alone.
37888,m105,jackie brown,L313708,u1598,ORDELL,Drink?
37889,m105,jackie brown,L313533,u1598,ORDELL,I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool I promise.
37890,m105,jackie brown,L313532,u1593,JACKIE,Look it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore and she fucks things up.
37891,m105,jackie brown,L313531,u1598,ORDELL,What'd you care?
37892,m105,jackie brown,L313530,u1593,JACKIE,Who?
37893,m105,jackie brown,L313529,u1598,ORDELL,Uh-huh.
37894,m105,jackie brown,L313528,u1593,JACKIE,The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
37895,m105,jackie brown,L313523,u1598,ORDELL,I can do that.
37896,m105,jackie brown,L313522,u1593,JACKIE,Plus the same deal as before.
37897,m105,jackie brown,L313521,u1598,ORDELL,I'll give ya ten.
37898,m105,jackie brown,L313520,u1593,JACKIE,That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
37899,m105,jackie brown,L313519,u1598,ORDELL,Managers get ten percent.
37900,m105,jackie brown,L313518,u1593,JACKIE,I ain't your partner I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico into America in your hands and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager and managers get fifteen percent.
37901,m105,jackie brown,L313517,u1598,ORDELL,Yeah but it's my money and I don't need me a partner.
37902,m105,jackie brown,L313516,u1593,JACKIE,Well it's my plan. We're in this together.
37903,m105,jackie brown,L313515,u1598,ORDELL,I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
37904,m105,jackie brown,L313514,u1593,JACKIE,I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
37905,m105,jackie brown,L313513,u1598,ORDELL,I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
37906,m105,jackie brown,L313512,u1593,JACKIE,Can you cover that?
37907,m105,jackie brown,L313511,u1598,ORDELL,So we need two people two women.
37908,m105,jackie brown,L313510,u1593,JACKIE,That's the idea.
37909,m105,jackie brown,L313509,u1598,ORDELL,And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
37910,m105,jackie brown,L313508,u1593,JACKIE,No I give it to someone else first.
37911,m105,jackie brown,L313507,u1598,ORDELL,But you don't?
37912,m105,jackie brown,L313506,u1593,JACKIE,The next trip when I come with all the money it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
37913,m105,jackie brown,L313505,u1598,ORDELL,Yeah I think a woman.
37914,m105,jackie brown,L313504,u1593,JACKIE,If you want.
37915,m105,jackie brown,L313503,u1598,ORDELL,A woman.
37916,m105,jackie brown,L313502,u1593,JACKIE,I don't know. One of your friends.
37917,m105,jackie brown,L313501,u1598,ORDELL,Who?
37918,m105,jackie brown,L313500,u1593,JACKIE,If you just listen you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
37919,m105,jackie brown,L313499,u1598,ORDELL,That's a good idea.
37920,m105,jackie brown,L313498,u1593,JACKIE,You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone and I never know who it is.
37921,m105,jackie brown,L313497,u1598,ORDELL,Naw naw that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
37922,m105,jackie brown,L313496,u1593,JACKIE,...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery when I bring in the half mill.
37923,m105,jackie brown,L313472,u1598,ORDELL,What did they say?
37924,m105,jackie brown,L313471,u1593,JACKIE,They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say well if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them let me bring the money in.
37925,m105,jackie brown,L313470,u1598,ORDELL,What the fuck's that got to do with it?
37926,m105,jackie brown,L313469,u1593,JACKIE,It's true isn't it?
37927,m105,jackie brown,L313468,u1598,ORDELL,You told them that?
37928,m105,jackie brown,L313467,u1593,JACKIE,I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico and you want me to bring it here.
37929,m105,jackie brown,L313466,u1598,ORDELL,Didja tell 'em anything else?
37930,m105,jackie brown,L313465,u1593,JACKIE,Look the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
37931,m105,jackie brown,L313464,u1598,ORDELL,Well shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
37932,m105,jackie brown,L313463,u1593,JACKIE,They already know it's you.
37933,m105,jackie brown,L313462,u1598,ORDELL,You told em? You told em it's me?
37934,m105,jackie brown,L313458,u1593,JACKIE,I told them.
37935,m105,jackie brown,L313457,u1598,ORDELL,How the fuck they know that?
37936,m105,jackie brown,L313456,u1593,JACKIE,I don't think so but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
37937,m105,jackie brown,L313455,u1598,ORDELL,You a fine lookin' woman Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
37938,m105,jackie brown,L313454,u1593,JACKIE,I do okay.
37939,m105,jackie brown,L313453,u1598,ORDELL,I bet you come here on a Saturday night you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
37940,m105,jackie brown,L313390,u1593,JACKIE,It's a cockatoo.
37941,m105,jackie brown,L313389,u1598,ORDELL,Oh wait you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
37942,m105,jackie brown,L313388,u1593,JACKIE,It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
37943,m105,jackie brown,L313387,u1598,ORDELL,The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
37944,m105,jackie brown,L313386,u1593,JACKIE,The Cockatoo Inn.
37945,m105,jackie brown,L313253,u1598,ORDELL,Talk to you tomorrow.
37946,m105,jackie brown,L313252,u1593,JACKIE,I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
37947,m105,jackie brown,L313251,u1593,JACKIE,I been thinkin about that too and I got me a idea.
37948,m105,jackie brown,L313250,u1598,ORDELL,Yeah.
37949,m105,jackie brown,L313249,u1593,JACKIE,All your money's in Mexico.
37950,m105,jackie brown,L313248,u1598,ORDELL,I got a problem...
37951,m105,jackie brown,L313247,u1593,JACKIE,One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name if I'm convicted up to a year or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year you pay another hundred thousand.
37952,m105,jackie brown,L313246,u1598,ORDELL,Yeah?
37953,m105,jackie brown,L313245,u1593,JACKIE,It's okay. I forgive you. Now let's say if I tell on you I walk. And if I don't I go to jail.
37954,m105,jackie brown,L313244,u1598,ORDELL,Baby I didn't --
37955,m105,jackie brown,L313243,u1593,JACKIE,Let's get realistic baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
37956,m105,jackie brown,L313241,u1593,JACKIE,Way I see it me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
37957,m105,jackie brown,L313240,u1598,ORDELL,I just came here to talk.
37958,m105,jackie brown,L313236,u1593,JACKIE,Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
37959,m105,jackie brown,L313235,u1598,ORDELL,I'm tellin' you those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black that's how they do.
37960,m105,jackie brown,L313234,u1593,JACKIE,Go sit over in that chair.
37961,m105,jackie brown,L313233,u1598,ORDELL,I understand woman damn!

37972,m105,jackie brown,L313222,u1593,JACKIE,What do you think it is?
37973,m105,jackie brown,L313216,u1593,JACKIE,They told me.
37974,m105,jackie brown,L313215,u1598,ORDELL,This fella Beaumont they say what happened to him?
37975,m105,jackie brown,L313211,u1593,JACKIE,I didn't tell 'em anything.
37976,m105,jackie brown,L313210,u1598,ORDELL,Yeah?
37977,m105,jackie brown,L313209,u1593,JACKIE,And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.

37979,m105,jackie brown,L313207,u1593,JACKIE,Beaumont Livingston.

38044,m105,jackie brown,L313440,u1594,LOUIS,That sounds like a problem.
38045,m105,jackie brown,L313439,u1596,MELANIE,I never got to know him really. I couldn't speak Japanese and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything because his English was better than my Japanese.
38046,m105,jackie brown,L313438,u1594,LOUIS,Must of made quite an impression.

38053,m105,jackie brown,L313431,u1596,MELANIE,That's a picture of me in Japan.
38054,m105,jackie brown,L313430,u1594,LOUIS,I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
38055,m105,jackie brown,L313429,u1596,MELANIE,Did you ever go I one?
38056,m105,jackie brown,L313428,u1594,LOUIS,I don't like dancing.

38077,m105,jackie brown,L313405,u1596,MELANIE,No it's what body builders drink to beef up.
38078,m105,jackie brown,L313404,u1594,LOUIS,It's a diet thing?

38082,m105,jackie brown,L313393,u1596,MELANIE,Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.
38083,m105,jackie brown,L313392,u1594,LOUIS,Yeah I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.

38103,m105,jackie brown,L312788,u1594,LOUIS,I can sit through it once.
38104,m105,jackie brown,L312787,u1596,MELANIE,It's boring isn't it?

38123,m105,jackie brown,L314031,u1598,ORDELL,Then she throws forty thousand in here to rub the shit in my face know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
38124,m105,jackie brown,L314030,u1594,LOUIS,That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
38125,m105,jackie brown,L314029,u1598,ORDELL,If there were nothin; in here but towels maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.

38144,m105,jackie brown,L314008,u1598,ORDELL,Came outta where?
38145,m105,jackie brown,L314007,u1594,LOUIS,Look that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it and neither did I.

She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
38277,m105,jackie brown,L314178,u1595,MAX,If she wanted to set you up you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
38278,m105,jackie brown,L314177,u1598,ORDELL,You expect me to just walk in there?
38279,m105,jackie brown,L314176,u1595,MAX,I'm telling you you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
38280,m105,jackie brown,L314175,u1598,ORDELL,Call her tell her the combination.
38281,m105,jackie brown,L314174,u1595,MAX,It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
38282,m105,jackie brown,L314173,u1598,ORDELL,Have her bring the money here.
38283,m105,jackie brown,L314172,u1595,MAX,She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
38284,m105,jackie brown,L314171,u1598,ORDELL,That I gotta see.
38285,m105,jackie brown,L314170,u1595,MAX,She was afraid.
38286,m105,jackie brown,L314169,u1598,ORDELL,She wanted to see me why wasn't she home?
38287,m105,jackie brown,L314168,u1595,MAX,She's been there since Thursday night.
38288,m105,jackie brown,L314167,u1598,ORDELL,And where's Jackie?

38292,m105,jackie brown,L314163,u1598,ORDELL,My ass be dumb but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
38293,m105,jackie brown,L314162,u1595,MAX,In a way yes.
38294,m105,jackie brown,L314161,u1598,ORDELL,And you did that to protect my interest?
38295,m105,jackie brown,L314160,u1595,MAX,All I did was walk out with it.
38296,m105,jackie brown,L314159,u1598,ORDELL,Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
38297,m105,jackie brown,L314158,u1595,MAX,Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
38298,m105,jackie brown,L314157,u1598,ORDELL,I'd like to hear that too. Turn around and put your hands on your head.
38299,m105,jackie brown,L314156,u1595,MAX,She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
38300,m105,jackie brown,L314155,u1598,ORDELL,Well give it to me then.
38301,m105,jackie brown,L314154,u1595,MAX,Uh-huh.
38302,m105,jackie brown,L314153,u1598,ORDELL,Well bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money huh?
38303,m105,jackie brown,L314152,u1595,MAX,That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
38304,m105,jackie brown,L314151,u1598,ORDELL,How the fuck did he find me?
38305,m105,jackie brown,L314150,u1595,MAX,Winston found you.
38306,m105,jackie brown,L314149,u1598,ORDELL,How'd you find me?
38307,m105,jackie brown,L314148,u1595,MAX,She wants to give you your money. If she didn't there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
38308,m105,jackie brown,L314147,u1598,ORDELL,You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
38309,m105,jackie brown,L314146,u1595,MAX,I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
38310,m105,jackie brown,L314145,u1598,ORDELL,That's all?

38312,m105,jackie brown,L314141,u1595,MAX,I'm alone.
38313,m105,jackie brown,L314140,u1598,ORDELL,You keep fuckin' with me you're gonna be asleep forever.
38314,m105,jackie brown,L314139,u1595,MAX,I thought you might be asleep.
38315,m105,jackie brown,L314138,u1598,ORDELL,What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
38316,m105,jackie brown,L314105,u1598,ORDELL,Looky here I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story she hands over my money. She do that we're still friends. Now she don't wanna be my friend no more tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that and I'll call you back.
38317,m105,jackie brown,L314104,u1595,MAX,You still there?
38318,m105,jackie brown,L314103,u1595,MAX,They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
38319,m105,jackie brown,L314102,u1598,ORDELL,She got off huh?
38320,m105,jackie brown,L314101,u1595,MAX,The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown remember?
38321,m105,jackie brown,L314100,u1595,MAX,Mister Robbie isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
38322,m105,jackie brown,L314099,u1598,ORDELL,You know who this is?
38323,m105,jackie brown,L313548,u1595,MAX,I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
38324,m105,jackie brown,L313547,u1598,ORDELL,What's up with this shit.
38325,m105,jackie brown,L313221,u1598,ORDELL,Is that what I think it is?
38326,m105,jackie brown,L313220,u1595,MAX,Where is it?
38327,m105,jackie brown,L313086,u1595,MAX,Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
38328,m105,jackie brown,L313084,u1595,MAX,Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
38329,m105,jackie brown,L313083,u1598,ORDELL,Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old gainfully employed black woman falsely accused --
38330,m105,jackie brown,L313082,u1595,MAX,Ordell this isn't a bar an you don't have a tab.
38331,m105,jackie brown,L313081,u1598,ORDELL,Man you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
38332,m105,jackie brown,L313080,u1595,MAX,If I don't see it in front of me you're right. It ain't shit.
38333,m105,jackie brown,L313079,u1598,ORDELL,Man you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
38334,m105,jackie brown,L313078,u1595,MAX,Well come back when you do and I'll bond out the stewardess.
38335,m105,jackie brown,L313077,u1598,ORDELL,I got it. I just don't got it on me.
38336,m105,jackie brown,L313076,u1595,MAX,I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do in case you forgot is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
38337,m105,jackie brown,L313075,u1598,ORDELL,Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
38338,m105,jackie brown,L313074,u1595,MAX,You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into you seem to be getting away with it so more power to you. Okay you want another bond and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate present it to the court fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
38339,m105,jackie brown,L313073,u1598,ORDELL,Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
38340,m105,jackie brown,L313072,u1595,MAX,Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
38341,m105,jackie brown,L313071,u1598,ORDELL,If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
38342,m105,jackie brown,L313070,u1595,MAX,You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
38343,m105,jackie brown,L313069,u1598,ORDELL,Is this me and you like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
38344,m105,jackie brown,L313068,u1595,MAX,Was she?
38345,m105,jackie brown,L313067,u1598,ORDELL,That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie I'm liable to have the police on me again huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me was she bringing me that money!
38346,m105,jackie brown,L313066,u1595,MAX,Beaumont worked for you.
38347,m105,jackie brown,L313065,u1598,ORDELL,Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble I like to help 'em out.
38348,m105,jackie brown,L313064,u1595,MAX,What does she do for you?
38349,m105,jackie brown,L313063,u1598,ORDELL,Brown Jackie Brown.
38350,m105,jackie brown,L313062,u1595,MAX,The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
38351,m105,jackie brown,L313061,u1598,ORDELL,Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman Sherona half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
38352,m105,jackie brown,L313060,u1595,MAX,Did the police contact you?
38353,m105,jackie brown,L313059,u1598,ORDELL,Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
38354,m105,jackie brown,L313058,u1595,MAX,Hear what?
38355,m105,jackie brown,L313057,u1598,ORDELL,You didn't hear?
38356,m105,jackie brown,L313056,u1595,MAX,What?
38357,m105,jackie brown,L313055,u1598,ORDELL,Somebody already did.
38358,m105,jackie brown,L313054,u1595,MAX,Before we start talking about stewardess let's get Beaumont out of the way first.
38359,m105,jackie brown,L313053,u1598,ORDELL,She had I believe it was... fifty grand on her too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
38360,m105,jackie brown,L313052,u1595,MAX,It still sounds high.
38361,m105,jackie brown,L313051,u1598,ORDELL,They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
38362,m105,jackie brown,L313050,u1595,MAX,The bond for possession is only a thousand.
38363,m105,jackie brown,L313049,u1598,ORDELL,She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now what I was thinkin' you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
38364,m105,jackie brown,L313048,u1595,MAX,Oh yeah? What did he do?
38365,m105,jackie brown,L313047,u1598,ORDELL,I got some more business for ya.
38366,m105,jackie brown,L313046,u1595,MAX,I can see that. Why?
38367,m105,jackie brown,L313045,u1598,ORDELL,The door was opened so I just came right in.
38368,m105,jackie brown,L313044,u1595,MAX,Comfortable?
38369,m105,jackie brown,L312884,u1598,ORDELL,I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies.  I get my money back don't I?
38370,m105,jackie brown,L312883,u1595,MAX,Yes.
38371,m105,jackie brown,L312882,u1598,ORDELL,Hey Max.
38372,m105,jackie brown,L312881,u1598,ORDELL,Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
38373,m105,jackie brown,L312880,u1595,MAX,Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond an Indemnity Agreement a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one if Beaumont skips and I go after him you pay the expenses.
38374,m105,jackie brown,L312878,u1595,MAX,Now I need you to count your money.
38375,m105,jackie brown,L312877,u1598,ORDELL,House.
38376,m105,jackie brown,L312876,u1595,MAX,House or apartment?

38379,m105,jackie brown,L312873,u1598,ORDELL,Man he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
38380,m105,jackie brown,L312872,u1595,MAX,They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years plus the concealed weapon.
38381,m105,jackie brown,L312871,u1598,ORDELL,Will they consider this a violation of his probation?

44445,m124,lost horizon,L357226,u1891,CHANG,Yes.
44446,m124,lost horizon,L357225,u1890,BARNARD,Two years!?
44447,m124,lost horizon,L357218,u1891,CHANG,Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
44448,m124,lost horizon,L357217,u1890,BARNARD,What about those men we met this morning?
44449,m124,lost horizon,L357208,u1891,CHANG,It's always been a source of deep regret but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
44450,m124,lost horizon,L357207,u1890,BARNARD,Not even a radio?
44451,m124,lost horizon,L357201,u1891,CHANG,Thank you.
44452,m124,lost horizon,L357200,u1890,BARNARD,Well there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
44453,m124,lost horizon,L357199,u1891,CHANG,She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
44454,m124,lost horizon,L357198,u1890,BARNARD,Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
44455,m124,lost horizon,L357661,u1890,BARNARD,Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village
44456,m124,lost horizon,L357660,u1898,LOVETT,Oh my isn't that pretty! What is it?
44457,m124,lost horizon,L357527,u1890,BARNARD,In a quandary.
44458,m124,lost horizon,L357526,u1898,LOVETT,Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
44459,m124,lost horizon,L357525,u1890,BARNARD,Come on Lovey.
44460,m124,lost horizon,L357524,u1898,LOVETT,They were in a quandary and
44461,m124,lost horizon,L357523,u1890,BARNARD,I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on Lovey!
44462,m124,lost horizon,L357520,u1898,LOVETT,This doesn't obligate me in any way.
44463,m124,lost horizon,L357519,u1890,BARNARD,There you are!
44464,m124,lost horizon,L357516,u1890,BARNARD,Certainly not!
44465,m124,lost horizon,L357515,u1898,LOVETT,And be poisoned out here in the open?
44466,m124,lost horizon,L357514,u1890,BARNARD,You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
44467,m124,lost horizon,L357513,u1898,LOVETT,So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
44468,m124,lost horizon,L357512,u1890,BARNARD,Hey Lovey come here! Lovey I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on sit down.
44469,m124,lost horizon,L357506,u1898,LOVETT,Horns? What kind of horns?
44470,m124,lost horizon,L357505,u1890,BARNARD,Yeah. You know.
44471,m124,lost horizon,L357504,u1898,LOVETT,Horns?
44472,m124,lost horizon,L357503,u1890,BARNARD,They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
44473,m124,lost horizon,L357502,u1898,LOVETT,And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
44474,m124,lost horizon,L357501,u1890,BARNARD,Okay Lovey.
44475,m124,lost horizon,L357500,u1898,LOVETT,Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf Barney! What effrontery!
44476,m124,lost horizon,L357499,u1890,BARNARD,Just call me Barney.
44477,m124,lost horizon,L357498,u1898,LOVETT,I don't know why I associate with you Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
44478,m124,lost horizon,L357408,u1890,BARNARD,Sounds like a stall to me.
44479,m124,lost horizon,L357407,u1898,LOVETT,Yes.
44480,m124,lost horizon,L357377,u1898,LOVETT,You are a thief sir and a swindler and I for one will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
44481,m124,lost horizon,L357376,u1890,BARNARD,You know that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary everyday slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains mind you he builds up a gigantic institution employs thousands of people becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
44482,m124,lost horizon,L357375,u1898,LOVETT,colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you the swindler of thousands of people
44483,m124,lost horizon,L357374,u1890,BARNARD,That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
44484,m124,lost horizon,L357368,u1890,BARNARD,Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
44485,m124,lost horizon,L357367,u1898,LOVETT,The police?
44486,m124,lost horizon,L357366,u1890,BARNARD,Believe me it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul they'd been on my tail for a year.
44487,m124,lost horizon,L357365,u1898,LOVETT,Certainly not.
44488,m124,lost horizon,L357362,u1898,LOVETT,It's very strange you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
44489,m124,lost horizon,L357361,u1890,BARNARD,Have I?
44490,m124,lost horizon,L357360,u1898,LOVETT,Ha ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
44491,m124,lost horizon,L357359,u1890,BARNARD,And say honey you look a million per cent better. Wholesome kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why it's like hiding behind a mask.
44492,m124,lost horizon,L357241,u1890,BARNARD,Then I'm your man.  Come on Toots.
44493,m124,lost horizon,L357240,u1898,LOVETT,Yes.
44494,m124,lost horizon,L357239,u1890,BARNARD,No kidding?
44495,m124,lost horizon,L357238,u1898,LOVETT,As a matter of fact I'm very good at double solitaire.
44496,m124,lost horizon,L357237,u1890,BARNARD,Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
44497,m124,lost horizon,L357236,u1898,LOVETT,I'm thinking.
44498,m124,lost horizon,L357235,u1890,BARNARD,How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
44499,m124,lost horizon,L357179,u1898,LOVETT,Mr. Conway I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
44500,m124,lost horizon,L357178,u1890,BARNARD,Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
44501,m124,lost horizon,L357177,u1898,LOVETT,All the conveniences for the condemned if you ask me.
44502,m124,lost horizon,L357176,u1890,BARNARD,Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
44503,m124,lost horizon,L357174,u1898,LOVETT,Please don't call me Lovey.
44504,m124,lost horizon,L357173,u1890,BARNARD,Uh-huh. You're a scream Lovey.
44505,m124,lost horizon,L357172,u1898,LOVETT,That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
44506,m124,lost horizon,L357171,u1890,BARNARD,Yeah? If this be execution lead me to it.
44507,m124,lost horizon,L357170,u1898,LOVETT,I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
44508,m124,lost horizon,L357169,u1890,BARNARD,Something tells me this means food. Come on!
44509,m124,lost horizon,L357168,u1890,BARNARD,You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned they're going to give them back to us Lovey.
44510,m124,lost horizon,L357167,u1898,LOVETT,Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
44511,m124,lost horizon,L357166,u1890,BARNARD,Will you stop squawking!
44512,m124,lost horizon,L357165,u1898,LOVETT,Mr. Barnard I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
44513,m124,lost horizon,L357143,u1898,LOVETT,Do you think they're cannibals?
44514,m124,lost horizon,L357142,u1890,BARNARD,Yes!
44515,m124,lost horizon,L357141,u1898,LOVETT,Where are they? Do you see them?
44516,m124,lost horizon,L357124,u1890,BARNARD,All right all right. Keep quiet.
44517,m124,lost horizon,L357123,u1898,LOVETT,Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
44518,m124,lost horizon,L357042,u1890,BARNARD,Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
44519,m124,lost horizon,L357041,u1898,LOVETT,Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
44520,m124,lost horizon,L357028,u1898,LOVETT,Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
44521,m124,lost horizon,L357027,u1890,BARNARD,He might have lost his way.
44522,m124,lost horizon,L357021,u1898,LOVETT,Now you're irritating and absurd!
44523,m124,lost horizon,L357020,u1890,BARNARD,Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east and we're going away from it.
44524,m124,lost horizon,L357019,u1898,LOVETT,Well you just reverse it. Your left hand is  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
44525,m124,lost horizon,L357018,u1890,BARNARD,Yes.
44526,m124,lost horizon,L357017,u1898,LOVETT,Oh really?
44527,m124,lost horizon,L357016,u1890,BARNARD,I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
44528,m124,lost horizon,L357015,u1898,LOVETT,Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air on the earth or in the sea. If you face the rising sun your right hand is the north and your left hand is the south
44529,m124,lost horizon,L357014,u1890,BARNARD,Look here
44530,m124,lost horizon,L357013,u1898,LOVETT,It certainly is.
44531,m124,lost horizon,L357012,u1890,BARNARD,Is it?
44532,m124,lost horizon,L357011,u1898,LOVETT,That's ridiculous.
44533,m124,lost horizon,L357010,u1890,BARNARD,Well it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
44534,m124,lost horizon,L357009,u1898,LOVETT,Why of course. Yes.
44535,m124,lost horizon,L357008,u1890,BARNARD,Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say we're supposed to be traveling east aren't we?
44536,m124,lost horizon,L357007,u1898,LOVETT,I'm never conversational before I coffee.
44537,m124,lost horizon,L357006,u1890,BARNARD,Well it's a good morning anyway.
44538,m124,lost horizon,L357005,u1898,LOVETT,I see.
44539,m124,lost horizon,L357004,u1890,BARNARD,I see.
44540,m124,lost horizon,L357003,u1898,LOVETT,I didn't care for 'sister' last night and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander P.
44541,m124,lost horizon,L357000,u1898,LOVETT,Good morning
44542,m124,lost horizon,L356999,u1890,BARNARD,I say good morning Lovey.
44543,m124,lost horizon,L356998,u1898,LOVETT,I beg your pardon.
44544,m124,lost horizon,L356997,u1890,BARNARD,Good morning Lovey.
44545,m124,lost horizon,L356970,u1890,BARNARD,Okay sister.  No offense. No offense!
44546,m124,lost horizon,L356969,u1898,LOVETT,Don't call me brother.
44547,m124,lost horizon,L356968,u1890,BARNARD,Okay brother.
44548,m124,lost horizon,L356967,u1898,LOVETT,Yes it just shows  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
44549,m124,lost horizon,L356965,u1898,LOVETT,Sir Henry Derwent was knighted and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
44550,m124,lost horizon,L356964,u1890,BARNARD,Yeah I remember. You said that before.
44551,m124,lost horizon,L356963,u1898,LOVETT,It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
44552,m124,lost horizon,L356962,u1890,BARNARD,Wait a minute you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
44553,m124,lost horizon,L356961,u1898,LOVETT,You see from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
44554,m124,lost horizon,L356960,u1890,BARNARD,Uh-huh.
44555,m124,lost horizon,L356959,u1898,LOVETT,This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
44556,m124,lost horizon,L356958,u1890,BARNARD,Sorry.
44557,m124,lost horizon,L356957,u1898,LOVETT,Not at all.
44558,m124,lost horizon,L356956,u1890,BARNARD,Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
44559,m124,lost horizon,L356955,u1898,LOVETT,When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
44560,m124,lost horizon,L356954,u1890,BARNARD,Uh-huh.
44561,m124,lost horizon,L356953,u1898,LOVETT,Found in Asia!
44562,m124,lost horizon,L356952,u1890,BARNARD,Well what do you know about that!
44563,m124,lost horizon,L356951,u1898,LOVETT,I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium[4] found in Asia.
44564,m124,lost horizon,L356950,u1890,BARNARD,Oh I see.
44565,m124,lost horizon,L356949,u1898,LOVETT,A paleontologist.
44566,m124,lost horizon,L356948,u1890,BARNARD,A what?
44567,m124,lost horizon,L356947,u1898,LOVETT,I'm a paleontologist.
44568,m124,lost horizon,L356946,u1890,BARNARD,Fossils huh?
44569,m124,lost horizon,L356945,u1898,LOVETT,Fossils.
44570,m124,lost horizon,L356944,u1890,BARNARD,I beg your pardon brother. What did you say you were hunting?
44571,m124,lost horizon,L357590,u1893,CONWAY,All right.
44572,m124,lost horizon,L357589,u1890,BARNARD,Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
44573,m124,lost horizon,L357588,u1893,CONWAY,Gold. You were going to
44574,m124,lost horizon,L357587,u1890,BARNARD,Huh?
44575,m124,lost horizon,L357586,u1893,CONWAY,Say what about that gold deal?
44576,m124,lost horizon,L357585,u1890,BARNARD,Think of it! In times like these.
44577,m124,lost horizon,L357584,u1893,CONWAY,It's unbelievable.
44578,m124,lost horizon,L357583,u1890,BARNARD,You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in but with the equipment we have here I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
44579,m124,lost horizon,L357404,u1893,CONWAY,Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas do we get the porters?
44580,m124,lost horizon,L357403,u1890,BARNARD,Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
44581,m124,lost horizon,L357370,u1890,BARNARD,Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
44582,m124,lost horizon,L357369,u1893,CONWAY,Chalmers Bryant!
44583,m124,lost horizon,L357364,u1890,BARNARD,All right I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey were you ever chased by the police?
44584,m124,lost horizon,L357363,u1893,CONWAY,Yes. Unbosom yourself Mr. Hyde.[11]
44585,m124,lost horizon,L357351,u1893,CONWAY,Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
44586,m124,lost horizon,L357350,u1890,BARNARD,Hey hurry up you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
44587,m124,lost horizon,L357234,u1893,CONWAY,Not for me thanks. No I'm too weary.
44588,m124,lost horizon,L357233,u1890,BARNARD,That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
44589,m124,lost horizon,L357181,u1890,BARNARD,I'll say.
44590,m124,lost horizon,L357180,u1893,CONWAY,It's better than freezing to death down below isn't it?
44591,m124,lost horizon,L357115,u1893,CONWAY,Well there's nothing we can do until the morning.
44592,m124,lost horizon,L357114,u1890,BARNARD,What are we going to do?
44593,m124,lost horizon,L357040,u1890,BARNARD,Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
44594,m124,lost horizon,L357039,u1893,CONWAY,Well that's that I guess.
44595,m124,lost horizon,L357038,u1890,BARNARD,Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
44596,m124,lost horizon,L357037,u1893,CONWAY,Charming chap.
44597,m124,lost horizon,L357645,u1890,BARNARD,Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
44599,m124,lost horizon,L357631,u1890,BARNARD,Oh that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
44601,m124,lost horizon,L357629,u1890,BARNARD,Look honey. We run the pipes through here and we connect with the main water line here.
44602,m124,lost horizon,L357356,u1890,BARNARD,Why you look beautiful.
44604,m124,lost horizon,L357354,u1890,BARNARD,Hey what's happened to you?
44606,m124,lost horizon,L356974,u1890,BARNARD,Say you're an American aren't you?
44608,m124,lost horizon,L356972,u1890,BARNARD,I say will you have a cigarette?
44609,m124,lost horizon,L357643,u1890,BARNARD,Oh no - you don't want to go yet honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
44610,m124,lost horizon,L357642,u1894,GEORGE,All right! If you insist on being an idiot I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
44611,m124,lost horizon,L357641,u1890,BARNARD,Well no. You see I got this plumbing business
44612,m124,lost horizon,L357640,u1894,GEORGE,I see. You're afraid of going to jail eh?
44613,m124,lost horizon,L357639,u1890,BARNARD,Well - I'm
44614,m124,lost horizon,L357638,u1894,GEORGE,You mean you don't want to go?
44615,m124,lost horizon,L357637,u1890,BARNARD,I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
44616,m124,lost horizon,L357636,u1894,GEORGE,Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
44617,m124,lost horizon,L357635,u1890,BARNARD,When are you going to start?
44618,m124,lost horizon,L357634,u1894,GEORGE,Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing food everything. Come on!
44619,m124,lost horizon,L357633,u1890,BARNARD,Leaving?
44620,m124,lost horizon,L357632,u1894,GEORGE,There you are! Barnard you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
44621,m124,lost horizon,L357140,u1894,GEORGE,Look Bob!
44622,m124,lost horizon,L357139,u1890,BARNARD,Hey - look!
44623,m124,lost horizon,L357138,u1894,GEORGE,Over by that hill.
44624,m124,lost horizon,L357137,u1890,BARNARD,Cave eh? Where?
44625,m124,lost horizon,L357619,u1893,CONWAY,I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
44626,m124,lost horizon,L357618,u1891,CHANG,You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
44627,m124,lost horizon,L357613,u1891,CHANG,Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday you build another fence around your minds.
44628,m124,lost horizon,L357612,u1893,CONWAY,It's weird.  Chang how old are you?
44629,m124,lost horizon,L357611,u1891,CHANG,Oh she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
44630,m124,lost horizon,L357610,u1893,CONWAY,No I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
44631,m124,lost horizon,L357609,u1891,CHANG,Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
44632,m124,lost horizon,L357608,u1893,CONWAY,Suppose she should leave it?
44633,m124,lost horizon,L357607,u1891,CHANG,Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
44634,m124,lost horizon,L357606,u1893,CONWAY,Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
44635,m124,lost horizon,L357605,u1891,CHANG,Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
44636,m124,lost horizon,L357604,u1893,CONWAY,Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
44637,m124,lost horizon,L357603,u1891,CHANG,Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
44638,m124,lost horizon,L357602,u1893,CONWAY,Yes charming.
44639,m124,lost horizon,L357601,u1891,CHANG,Charming isn't she?
44640,m124,lost horizon,L357598,u1893,CONWAY,No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
44641,m124,lost horizon,L357597,u1891,CHANG,Shall we have another?
44642,m124,lost horizon,L357596,u1893,CONWAY,Yes. I'm afraid it does.
44643,m124,lost horizon,L357413,u1893,CONWAY,Well then he's the man I want to see.  Will you come along?
44644,m124,lost horizon,L357412,u1891,CHANG,The High Lama arranges everything Mr. Conway.
44645,m124,lost horizon,L357411,u1893,CONWAY,And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
44646,m124,lost horizon,L357410,u1891,CHANG,The only one.
44647,m124,lost horizon,L357409,u1893,CONWAY,One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
44648,m124,lost horizon,L357332,u1891,CHANG,Then everything is quite all right isn't it?
44649,m124,lost horizon,L357331,u1893,CONWAY,Mr. Chang if you don't mind I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation of course.
44650,m124,lost horizon,L357330,u1891,CHANG,I mean your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
44651,m124,lost horizon,L357329,u1893,CONWAY,I surprise you? Now that's news.
44652,m124,lost horizon,L357328,u1891,CHANG,Why Mr. Conway you surprise me!
44653,m124,lost horizon,L357327,u1893,CONWAY,That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing of course.
44654,m124,lost horizon,L357326,u1891,CHANG,And very true. Your lives are therefore as a rule shorter not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
44655,m124,lost horizon,L357325,u1893,CONWAY,Very often.
44656,m124,lost horizon,L357323,u1893,CONWAY,Oh no. Just a little bowled over that's all.
44657,m124,lost horizon,L357322,u1891,CHANG,You're startled?
44658,m124,lost horizon,L357321,u1893,CONWAY,108 and still active?
44659,m124,lost horizon,L357320,u1891,CHANG,Rather astonishingly so yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La he was 108 years old and still very active in spite of only having one leg?
44660,m124,lost horizon,L357319,u1893,CONWAY,Well is it?
44661,m124,lost horizon,L357318,u1891,CHANG,Yes yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
44662,m124,lost horizon,L357317,u1893,CONWAY,Well they didn't actually mean that.
44663,m124,lost horizon,L357316,u1891,CHANG,Yes. Oddly enough later when he had learned to understand their language the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
44664,m124,lost horizon,L357315,u1893,CONWAY,He amputated his own leg?
44665,m124,lost horizon,L357314,u1891,CHANG,Oh let me see - way back in 1713 I think it was that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that one leg being frozen and of course there being no doctors here he amputated the leg himself.
44666,m124,lost horizon,L357313,u1893,CONWAY,When was all this?
44667,m124,lost horizon,L357312,u1891,CHANG,A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault the first European to find this place and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La taught our natives and began our collection of art. In fact Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
44668,m124,lost horizon,L357311,u1893,CONWAY,Who?
44669,m124,lost horizon,L357310,u1891,CHANG,That my dear Conway is the story of a remarkable man.
44670,m124,lost horizon,L357309,u1893,CONWAY,I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
44671,m124,lost horizon,L357308,u1891,CHANG,Buy and - sell? No no pardon me exchange .
44672,m124,lost horizon,L357307,u1893,CONWAY,buy and sell?
44673,m124,lost horizon,L357306,u1891,CHANG,Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
44674,m124,lost horizon,L357305,u1893,CONWAY,That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
44675,m124,lost horizon,L357304,u1891,CHANG,Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because well because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
44676,m124,lost horizon,L357303,u1893,CONWAY,Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
44677,m124,lost horizon,L357302,u1891,CHANG,Centuries.
44678,m124,lost horizon,L357301,u1893,CONWAY,Well it must have taken
44679,m124,lost horizon,L357300,u1891,CHANG,They were.
44680,m124,lost horizon,L357299,u1893,CONWAY,But Mr. Chang all these things - books instruments sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
44681,m124,lost horizon,L357296,u1891,CHANG,You'd be surprised my dear Conway how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
44682,m124,lost horizon,L357295,u1893,CONWAY,That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
44683,m124,lost horizon,L357294,u1891,CHANG,Well in that event it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
44684,m124,lost horizon,L357293,u1893,CONWAY,Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
44685,m124,lost horizon,L357292,u1891,CHANG,Only very rarely. You see it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
44686,m124,lost horizon,L357291,u1893,CONWAY,You have no disputes over women?
44687,m124,lost horizon,L357290,u1891,CHANG,Why we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack usually. Avariciousness envy the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
44688,m124,lost horizon,L357289,u1893,CONWAY,How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
44689,m124,lost horizon,L357288,u1891,CHANG,Oh good heavens no!
44690,m124,lost horizon,L357287,u1893,CONWAY,How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
44691,m124,lost horizon,L357286,u1891,CHANG,We find in the Valley it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
44692,m124,lost horizon,L357285,u1893,CONWAY,That's intelligent.
44693,m124,lost horizon,L357284,u1891,CHANG,To put it simply I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind even including  the excess of virtue itself.
44694,m124,lost horizon,L357283,u1891,CHANG,We follow many.
44695,m124,lost horizon,L357282,u1893,CONWAY,By the way what religion do you follow here?
44696,m124,lost horizon,L357275,u1891,CHANG,Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
44697,m124,lost horizon,L357274,u1893,CONWAY,You know that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
44698,m124,lost horizon,L357273,u1891,CHANG,There are some things my dear Conway I deeply regret I may not discuss.
44699,m124,lost horizon,L357272,u1893,CONWAY,For a man who talks a great deal it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
44700,m124,lost horizon,L357271,u1891,CHANG,In time you will meet them all.
44701,m124,lost horizon,L357270,u1893,CONWAY,Who for instance?
44702,m124,lost horizon,L357269,u1891,CHANG,Oh yes.
44703,m124,lost horizon,L357268,u1893,CONWAY,So there are others?
44704,m124,lost horizon,L357267,u1891,CHANG,Goodness no!
44705,m124,lost horizon,L357266,u1893,CONWAY,Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
44706,m124,lost horizon,L357265,u1891,CHANG,It's three thousand feet practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
44707,m124,lost horizon,L357203,u1891,CHANG,I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
44708,m124,lost horizon,L357202,u1893,CONWAY,And the wine - excellent.
44709,m124,lost horizon,L357160,u1893,CONWAY,Thank you.
44710,m124,lost horizon,L357159,u1891,CHANG,You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far but quite difficult.
44711,m124,lost horizon,L357154,u1893,CONWAY,He must have had a heart attack or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
44712,m124,lost horizon,L357153,u1891,CHANG,Where is your mad pilot?
44713,m124,lost horizon,L357150,u1893,CONWAY,You've no idea sir how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction
44714,m124,lost horizon,L357149,u1891,CHANG,How do you do?
44715,m124,lost horizon,L357148,u1893,CONWAY,And mine's Conway.
44717,m124,lost horizon,L357192,u1891,CHANG,You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
44719,m124,lost horizon,L357190,u1891,CHANG,Please let me help you.
44721,m124,lost horizon,L357188,u1891,CHANG,I'm sorry but we have no doctors here.
44723,m124,lost horizon,L357186,u1891,CHANG,Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
44725,m124,lost horizon,L357184,u1891,CHANG,I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
44727,m124,lost horizon,L357582,u1891,CHANG,Thank you.
44728,m124,lost horizon,L357581,u1898,LOVETT,Oh thank you. Thank you!
44729,m124,lost horizon,L357580,u1891,CHANG,Then it's done.
44730,m124,lost horizon,L357579,u1898,LOVETT,Oh immediately.
44731,m124,lost horizon,L357578,u1891,CHANG,I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
44732,m124,lost horizon,L357577,u1898,LOVETT,Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
44733,m124,lost horizon,L357576,u1891,CHANG,Splendid!
44734,m124,lost horizon,L357575,u1898,LOVETT,Well Mr. Chang I thought with your permission of course and while I'm waiting for these porters I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
44735,m124,lost horizon,L357574,u1891,CHANG,Now what would you like to do?
44736,m124,lost horizon,L357572,u1891,CHANG,Why no.
44737,m124,lost horizon,L357570,u1891,CHANG,Oh I'm so glad.
44738,m124,lost horizon,L357569,u1898,LOVETT,I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er Mr. Chang I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
44739,m124,lost horizon,L357568,u1891,CHANG,You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
44740,m124,lost horizon,L357567,u1898,LOVETT,You may not know it Mr. Chang but right here you have Utopia.[15]
44741,m124,lost horizon,L357566,u1891,CHANG,Yes.
44742,m124,lost horizon,L357565,u1898,LOVETT,Amazing Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very very happy.
44743,m124,lost horizon,L357402,u1898,LOVETT,The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
44744,m124,lost horizon,L357401,u1891,CHANG,You know it's very very strange but when you saw me in the corridor I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you Mr. Conway.
44745,m124,lost horizon,L357224,u1891,CHANG,Well we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
44746,m124,lost horizon,L357216,u1891,CHANG,No.
44747,m124,lost horizon,L357215,u1898,LOVETT,No porters here!!
44748,m124,lost horizon,L357214,u1891,CHANG,I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see we have no porters here.
44749,m124,lost horizon,L357213,u1898,LOVETT,Of course the porters will be very well paid - that is within reason.
44750,m124,lost horizon,L357617,u1894,GEORGE,You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get outporters or no porters!
44751,m124,lost horizon,L357616,u1891,CHANG,Now my dear boy. You shouldn't
44752,m124,lost horizon,L357615,u1894,GEORGE,A fine trick! Smart aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
44753,m124,lost horizon,L357406,u1894,GEORGE,Don't believe him Bob. He's just trying to get out.
44754,m124,lost horizon,L357405,u1891,CHANG,The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
44755,m124,lost horizon,L357222,u1891,CHANG,In that respect you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now
44756,m124,lost horizon,L357221,u1894,GEORGE,How can we get in touch with them?
44757,m124,lost horizon,L357220,u1891,CHANG,Oh yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again depending upon favorable weather of course they make the journey.
44758,m124,lost horizon,L357212,u1891,CHANG,Oh dear.
44759,m124,lost horizon,L357211,u1894,GEORGE,As far away as I ever want to be.
44760,m124,lost horizon,L357210,u1891,CHANG,Are you so certain you are away from it?
44761,m124,lost horizon,L357209,u1894,GEORGE,In that event we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
44762,m124,lost horizon,L357156,u1891,CHANG,Pardon me
44763,m124,lost horizon,L357155,u1894,GEORGE,We were just going to bury him when you came along.
44764,m124,lost horizon,L357761,u1893,CONWAY,Hey!
44766,m124,lost horizon,L357743,u1893,CONWAY,Yes of course. Certainly. Come on!
44769,m124,lost horizon,L357733,u1893,CONWAY,You're lying aren't you?
44771,m124,lost horizon,L357729,u1893,CONWAY,Yes.
44773,m124,lost horizon,L357727,u1893,CONWAY,Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman do you?
44775,m124,lost horizon,L357725,u1893,CONWAY,Father Perrault is dead.
44777,m124,lost horizon,L357723,u1893,CONWAY,I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
44779,m124,lost horizon,L357721,u1893,CONWAY,Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
44782,m124,lost horizon,L357434,u1893,CONWAY,But to be candid Father a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so then long life must be even more pointless. No I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
44784,m124,lost horizon,L357432,u1893,CONWAY,Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that for the moment doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
44786,m124,lost horizon,L357430,u1893,CONWAY,Oh the girl at the piano?
44788,m124,lost horizon,L357428,u1893,CONWAY,That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
44791,m124,lost horizon,L357424,u1893,CONWAY,You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive Father Perrault!
44793,m124,lost horizon,L357422,u1893,CONWAY,It's astonishing - and incredible but
44794,m124,lost horizon,L357421,u1893,CONWAY,Personally I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as
44797,m124,lost horizon,L357418,u1893,CONWAY,Are you the High Lama?
44799,m124,lost horizon,L357627,u1893,CONWAY,Do you think this will come in my time?
44802,m124,lost horizon,L357623,u1893,CONWAY,Mine?
44804,m124,lost horizon,L357621,u1893,CONWAY,I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
44806,m124,lost horizon,L357763,u1893,CONWAY,As long as they keep on aiming at us we're safe.  Come now child.
44807,m124,lost horizon,L357762,u1894,GEORGE,Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
44808,m124,lost horizon,L357759,u1893,CONWAY,There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us but we must go on.  Come on.
44809,m124,lost horizon,L357758,u1894,GEORGE,Bob can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
44810,m124,lost horizon,L357750,u1893,CONWAY,Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
44811,m124,lost horizon,L357749,u1894,GEORGE,was saying
44812,m124,lost horizon,L357748,u1893,CONWAY,What was that?
44813,m124,lost horizon,L357747,u1894,GEORGE,Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
44814,m124,lost horizon,L357741,u1893,CONWAY,Come on! We're wasting time!
44815,m124,lost horizon,L357740,u1894,GEORGE,I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
44816,m124,lost horizon,L357739,u1893,CONWAY,What about the others?
44817,m124,lost horizon,L357738,u1894,GEORGE,Yes everything!
44818,m124,lost horizon,L357737,u1893,CONWAY,The clothes?
44819,m124,lost horizon,L357736,u1894,GEORGE,Yes.
44820,m124,lost horizon,L357735,u1893,CONWAY,You say the porters are waiting for us?
44821,m124,lost horizon,L357732,u1893,CONWAY,I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on say it!
44822,m124,lost horizon,L357731,u1894,GEORGE,She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were Bob.
44823,m124,lost horizon,L357714,u1894,GEORGE,All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
44824,m124,lost horizon,L357713,u1893,CONWAY,I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
44825,m124,lost horizon,L357712,u1894,GEORGE,So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
44826,m124,lost horizon,L357711,u1894,GEORGE,I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
44827,m124,lost horizon,L357710,u1893,CONWAY,You're wrong George.
44828,m124,lost horizon,L357709,u1894,GEORGE,This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why she isn't a day over twenty!
44829,m124,lost horizon,L357708,u1893,CONWAY,She came here in 1888!
44830,m124,lost horizon,L357706,u1893,CONWAY,Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
44831,m124,lost horizon,L357705,u1894,GEORGE,Why not?
44832,m124,lost horizon,L357704,u1893,CONWAY,You can't take her away from here!
44833,m124,lost horizon,L357702,u1894,GEORGE,She's going with me.
44834,m124,lost horizon,L357701,u1893,CONWAY,What's she got to do with it?
44835,m124,lost horizon,L357700,u1894,GEORGE,Yes the little Russian girl.
44836,m124,lost horizon,L357699,u1893,CONWAY,Maria?
44837,m124,lost horizon,L357698,u1894,GEORGE,Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
44838,m124,lost horizon,L357697,u1893,CONWAY,George are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you I mean?
44839,m124,lost horizon,L357696,u1894,GEORGE,Well I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye Bob.
44840,m124,lost horizon,L357695,u1893,CONWAY,George I may be wrong I may be a maniac. But I believe in this and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you but this is bigger stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry George. I'm staying.
44841,m124,lost horizon,L357694,u1894,GEORGE,I'd go mad!
44842,m124,lost horizon,L357693,u1893,CONWAY,George you couldn't possibly stay here could you?
44843,m124,lost horizon,L357692,u1894,GEORGE,Besides I - I don't feel like making that trip alone Bob.
44844,m124,lost horizon,L357691,u1893,CONWAY,Oh George . . .
44845,m124,lost horizon,L357690,u1894,GEORGE,Look here Bob Ever since I can remember you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother Bob. If there's something wrong with you let me help you.
44846,m124,lost horizon,L357689,u1893,CONWAY,Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well why don't you go?
44847,m124,lost horizon,L357688,u1894,GEORGE,It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
44848,m124,lost horizon,L357687,u1893,CONWAY,I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
44849,m124,lost horizon,L357686,u1894,GEORGE,You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
44850,m124,lost horizon,L357685,u1893,CONWAY,Please George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
44851,m124,lost horizon,L357684,u1894,GEORGE,It's no place for you Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
44852,m124,lost horizon,L357683,u1893,CONWAY,Then you'd better go George. This is no place for you.
44853,m124,lost horizon,L357682,u1894,GEORGE,What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
44854,m124,lost horizon,L357681,u1893,CONWAY,Is that all my story meant to you?
44855,m124,lost horizon,L357680,u1894,GEORGE,I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
44856,m124,lost horizon,L357679,u1893,CONWAY,I don't need any proof.
44857,m124,lost horizon,L357678,u1894,GEORGE,I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
44858,m124,lost horizon,L357677,u1893,CONWAY,So you think it's all nonsense huh?
44859,m124,lost horizon,L357676,u1894,GEORGE,What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens Bob things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
44860,m124,lost horizon,L357675,u1893,CONWAY,So you think I'm mad?
44861,m124,lost horizon,L357674,u1894,GEORGE,Well I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
44862,m124,lost horizon,L357672,u1893,CONWAY,I will George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable but so beautiful!  Well as you know we were kidnapped and brought here . . .
44863,m124,lost horizon,L357671,u1894,GEORGE,I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
44864,m124,lost horizon,L357670,u1893,CONWAY,Something grand and beautiful George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it George and I can't leave it. You mustn't either.
44865,m124,lost horizon,L357669,u1894,GEORGE,Stay here?!  What's the matter with you Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
44866,m124,lost horizon,L357668,u1893,CONWAY,You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
44867,m124,lost horizon,L357667,u1894,GEORGE,Why not? What's going to stop me?
44868,m124,lost horizon,L357666,u1893,CONWAY,You can't leave George.
44869,m124,lost horizon,L357665,u1894,GEORGE,I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on get your things together. Where's your top coat?
44870,m124,lost horizon,L357594,u1894,GEORGE,I don't see that there's anything to say.
44871,m124,lost horizon,L357593,u1893,CONWAY,George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
44872,m124,lost horizon,L357445,u1893,CONWAY,George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry but I can't talk about it tonight.
44873,m124,lost horizon,L357444,u1894,GEORGE,For heaven's sake Bob what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of
44874,m124,lost horizon,L357442,u1893,CONWAY,Why - I'm sorry - but I
44875,m124,lost horizon,L357441,u1894,GEORGE,Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
44876,m124,lost horizon,L357440,u1893,CONWAY,Porters?
44877,m124,lost horizon,L357439,u1894,GEORGE,What about the porters?
44878,m124,lost horizon,L357392,u1893,CONWAY,All right. Sorry George.
44879,m124,lost horizon,L357391,u1894,GEORGE,Let me up! Let me up!
44880,m124,lost horizon,L357387,u1894,GEORGE,Chang! Chang! Chang!
44881,m124,lost horizon,L357386,u1893,CONWAY,George come back!
44882,m124,lost horizon,L357385,u1894,GEORGE,Let me go Bob!
44883,m124,lost horizon,L357384,u1893,CONWAY,George what do you think you're doing?
44884,m124,lost horizon,L357349,u1893,CONWAY,Shhh!
44885,m124,lost horizon,L357348,u1894,GEORGE,I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
44886,m124,lost horizon,L357347,u1893,CONWAY,Well we haven't been murdered in our beds yet George have we?
44887,m124,lost horizon,L357346,u1894,GEORGE,Good heavens Bob we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
44888,m124,lost horizon,L357345,u1893,CONWAY,Porters?
44889,m124,lost horizon,L357344,u1894,GEORGE,Nothing about the porters yet?
44890,m124,lost horizon,L357343,u1893,CONWAY,Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife she's yours if he's got any manners.
44891,m124,lost horizon,L357264,u1893,CONWAY,That's what's on the other side of the hill.
44892,m124,lost horizon,L357263,u1894,GEORGE,There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
44893,m124,lost horizon,L357262,u1893,CONWAY,Uh-huh.
44894,m124,lost horizon,L357261,u1894,GEORGE,Chang's first question was about the pilot.
44895,m124,lost horizon,L357260,u1893,CONWAY,George I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
44896,m124,lost horizon,L357259,u1894,GEORGE,What's on your mind Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
44897,m124,lost horizon,L357258,u1893,CONWAY,Well - I mean
44898,m124,lost horizon,L357257,u1894,GEORGE,That's what you said.
44899,m124,lost horizon,L357255,u1894,GEORGE,What do you mean if we should get out?
44900,m124,lost horizon,L357254,u1893,CONWAY,Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
44901,m124,lost horizon,L357253,u1894,GEORGE,What could there be except just another hill? In any event I'm not curious. At the moment it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
44902,m124,lost horizon,L357252,u1893,CONWAY,Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
44903,m124,lost horizon,L357251,u1894,GEORGE,You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
44904,m124,lost horizon,L357250,u1893,CONWAY,I don't know.
44905,m124,lost horizon,L357249,u1894,GEORGE,What are you talking about?
44906,m124,lost horizon,L357248,u1893,CONWAY,Something happened to me when we arrived here George that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place and feel certain that you've been there before?
44907,m124,lost horizon,L357247,u1894,GEORGE,You talk as though you intend on staying.
44908,m124,lost horizon,L357246,u1893,CONWAY,Oh I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
44909,m124,lost horizon,L357245,u1894,GEORGE,It's far from over from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob you don't seem concerned at all.
44910,m124,lost horizon,L357244,u1893,CONWAY,We've had plenty of it the last few days.
44911,m124,lost horizon,L357243,u1894,GEORGE,Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
44912,m124,lost horizon,L357242,u1893,CONWAY,Hello George.  Cigarette?
44913,m124,lost horizon,L357108,u1893,CONWAY,It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
44914,m124,lost horizon,L357107,u1894,GEORGE,What's it mean?
44915,m124,lost horizon,L357106,u1893,CONWAY,That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
44916,m124,lost horizon,L357105,u1894,GEORGE,Yes.
44917,m124,lost horizon,L357104,u1893,CONWAY,See that spot?
44918,m124,lost horizon,L357103,u1894,GEORGE,What is it?
44919,m124,lost horizon,L357101,u1894,GEORGE,Dead?
44920,m124,lost horizon,L357100,u1893,CONWAY,He's dead.
44921,m124,lost horizon,L357098,u1893,CONWAY,It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
44922,m124,lost horizon,L357097,u1894,GEORGE,What is it? Has he fainted?
44923,m124,lost horizon,L357084,u1894,GEORGE,It's not knowing that's so awful Bob. Not knowing where you're going or why or what's waiting when you get there.
44924,m124,lost horizon,L357083,u1893,CONWAY,Oh George come on.
44925,m124,lost horizon,L357064,u1893,CONWAY,I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
44926,m124,lost horizon,L357063,u1894,GEORGE,What are these people?
44927,m124,lost horizon,L357048,u1894,GEORGE,I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
44928,m124,lost horizon,L357047,u1893,CONWAY,George what are you going to do?
44929,m124,lost horizon,L357034,u1894,GEORGE,The bloke up there looks a Chinese or a Mongolian or something.
44930,m124,lost horizon,L357033,u1893,CONWAY,Oh stop it!
44931,m124,lost horizon,L356995,u1893,CONWAY,Huh? Oh sure Freshie. Good thing sleep.
44932,m124,lost horizon,L356994,u1894,GEORGE,Do try to sleep Bob.
44933,m124,lost horizon,L356993,u1893,CONWAY,Don't worry George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
44934,m124,lost horizon,L356990,u1894,GEORGE,You'd better try to get some sleep Bob.
44935,m124,lost horizon,L356989,u1893,CONWAY,Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
44936,m124,lost horizon,L356988,u1894,GEORGE,Yes.
44937,m124,lost horizon,L356987,u1893,CONWAY,Did you say we saved ninety white people?
44938,m124,lost horizon,L356986,u1894,GEORGE,Yes Bob.
44939,m124,lost horizon,L356985,u1893,CONWAY,Hello Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
44940,m124,lost horizon,L356982,u1893,CONWAY,Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
44941,m124,lost horizon,L356980,u1893,CONWAY,Hurray!
44942,m124,lost horizon,L356979,u1894,GEORGE,Just this once Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means.  Here you are. Don't bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me.  Gentlemen I give you Robert Conway - England's new Foreign Secretary.
44943,m124,lost horizon,L356978,u1893,CONWAY,You?
44944,m124,lost horizon,L356977,u1894,GEORGE,Just what I needed too.
44945,m124,lost horizon,L356943,u1893,CONWAY,Aha - very good Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
44946,m124,lost horizon,L356942,u1894,GEORGE,The next time you're in wild country like this keep in touch with the British Consul.
44947,m124,lost horizon,L356926,u1893,CONWAY,Come on! Quick! This way.
44948,m124,lost horizon,L356925,u1894,GEORGE,Bob these are all that are left.
44949,m124,lost horizon,L356921,u1894,GEORGE,Right Bob.
44950,m124,lost horizon,L356920,u1893,CONWAY,All right go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
44951,m124,lost horizon,L356919,u1893,CONWAY,Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
44952,m124,lost horizon,L356918,u1894,GEORGE,The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
44953,m124,lost horizon,L356904,u1893,CONWAY,Hello? Colonel?
44954,m124,lost horizon,L356903,u1894,GEORGE,Yes.
44955,m124,lost horizon,L356902,u1893,CONWAY,And be sure that none of the natives get in.
44956,m124,lost horizon,L356901,u1894,GEORGE,Yes.
44957,m124,lost horizon,L356900,u1893,CONWAY,Colonel wait a minute they may be here now!  Say George get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
44958,m124,lost horizon,L356899,u1894,GEORGE,Bob! I think I hear motors!
44959,m124,lost horizon,L357152,u1893,CONWAY,We'd be eternally grateful if you
44960,m124,lost horizon,L357151,u1898,LOVETT,At the mercy of a mad pilot.
44961,m124,lost horizon,L357080,u1898,LOVETT,Well Mr. Conway for a man who is supposed to be a leader your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
44962,m124,lost horizon,L357079,u1893,CONWAY,Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
44963,m124,lost horizon,L357067,u1898,LOVETT,Where are we going? Huh?
44964,m124,lost horizon,L357066,u1893,CONWAY,Imagine having all that fuel there waiting for us!  George something tells me our journey is just beginning.
44965,m124,lost horizon,L357060,u1893,CONWAY,It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen I'm going back to sleep. Oh and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands let me know.
44966,m124,lost horizon,L357059,u1898,LOVETT,Why you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
44967,m124,lost horizon,L357058,u1893,CONWAY,What do you suggest?
44968,m124,lost horizon,L357057,u1898,LOVETT,You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
44969,m124,lost horizon,L357056,u1893,CONWAY,I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands we'll find out.
44970,m124,lost horizon,L357055,u1898,LOVETT,In for what?
44971,m124,lost horizon,L357054,u1893,CONWAY,I guess we're in for it.
44972,m124,lost horizon,L357052,u1893,CONWAY,Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
44973,m124,lost horizon,L357051,u1898,LOVETT,We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
44974,m124,lost horizon,L357050,u1893,CONWAY,What if he refuses?
44975,m124,lost horizon,L357049,u1898,LOVETT,Good.
44976,m124,lost horizon,L357046,u1898,LOVETT,What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
44977,m124,lost horizon,L357045,u1893,CONWAY,That fellow got on at Baskul.
44978,m124,lost horizon,L357044,u1898,LOVETT,Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
44979,m124,lost horizon,L357043,u1893,CONWAY,No. That's not possible! If we had landed we all would have been awakened.
44980,m124,lost horizon,L356941,u1893,CONWAY,I know - and a war broke out right over your head.
44981,m124,lost horizon,L356940,u1898,LOVETT,Hiding? Oh no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly
44982,m124,lost horizon,L356939,u1893,CONWAY,Where were you hiding?
44983,m124,lost horizon,L356936,u1893,CONWAY,Why aren't you registered through our office?
44984,m124,lost horizon,L356935,u1898,LOVETT,I'm Alexander P. Lovett sir.
44985,m124,lost horizon,L356934,u1893,CONWAY,Where did you come from?
44986,m124,lost horizon,L357564,u1893,CONWAY,Forgiven.  You know when we were on that plane I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills leaping rivers crashing over obstacles never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
44989,m124,lost horizon,L357560,u1893,CONWAY,I'd love it!
44991,m124,lost horizon,L357558,u1893,CONWAY,Because mother read it in a book somewhere and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant mother's going to wring her little neck.
44993,m124,lost horizon,L357556,u1893,CONWAY,It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for darling.
44995,m124,lost horizon,L357554,u1893,CONWAY,You know if you keep on asking that we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
44997,m124,lost horizon,L357552,u1893,CONWAY,Well everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself accumulate a nest egg and so on.
44999,m124,lost horizon,L357550,u1893,CONWAY,Oh the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
45001,m124,lost horizon,L357548,u1893,CONWAY,It's not so bad really. Some phases are a little sordid of course. That's only to be expected.
45003,m124,lost horizon,L357546,u1893,CONWAY,You know sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
45005,m124,lost horizon,L357544,u1893,CONWAY,Ouch!
45006,m124,lost horizon,L357543,u1893,CONWAY,When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
45008,m124,lost horizon,L357541,u1893,CONWAY,Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
45009,m124,lost horizon,L357497,u1893,CONWAY,Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
45011,m124,lost horizon,L357495,u1893,CONWAY,I wonder.
45013,m124,lost horizon,L357493,u1893,CONWAY,I can't quite explain it but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see these cherry blossoms you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime a great crime yet I accept it amiably with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
45015,m124,lost horizon,L357491,u1893,CONWAY,On the contrary you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before that I belong here.
45017,m124,lost horizon,L357489,u1893,CONWAY,All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place hidden away from the rest of the world with its glorious concepts and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
45019,m124,lost horizon,L357485,u1893,CONWAY,Oh you're going to make life very simple.
45021,m124,lost horizon,L357483,u1893,CONWAY,Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing.
45023,m124,lost horizon,L357481,u1893,CONWAY,Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
45025,m124,lost horizon,L357479,u1893,CONWAY,Thank you.
45027,m124,lost horizon,L357477,u1893,CONWAY,There are so many questions I'd like to ask you I hardly know where to begin.
45028,m124,lost horizon,L357476,u1893,CONWAY,Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
45030,m124,lost horizon,L357474,u1893,CONWAY,You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
45032,m124,lost horizon,L357472,u1893,CONWAY,A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai smoke pouring out of its funnels tugging at its moorings waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
45035,m124,lost horizon,L357469,u1893,CONWAY,A man whose life was empty!
45037,m124,lost horizon,L357467,u1893,CONWAY,Oh you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
45039,m124,lost horizon,L357465,u1893,CONWAY,You suggested my being brought here didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
45041,m124,lost horizon,L357463,u1893,CONWAY,Was this your idea?
45043,m124,lost horizon,L357459,u1893,CONWAY,You know each time I see you I hear that music. What is it?
45044,m124,lost horizon,L357458,u1893,CONWAY,hope you'll forgive me for
45046,m124,lost horizon,L357456,u1893,CONWAY,Oh please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
45047,m124,lost horizon,L357654,u1898,LOVETT,Yes.  Barney!
45048,m124,lost horizon,L357653,u1894,GEORGE,You'll wait till you rot!
45049,m124,lost horizon,L357652,u1898,LOVETT,Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes yes. I will. I'll wait.
45050,m124,lost horizon,L357651,u1894,GEORGE,I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
45051,m124,lost horizon,L357650,u1898,LOVETT,Oh my dear boy I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why I have my classes all started.
45052,m124,lost horizon,L357649,u1894,GEORGE,Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
45053,m124,lost horizon,L357648,u1898,LOVETT,Go? Where?
45054,m124,lost horizon,L357647,u1894,GEORGE,How about you? Do you want to go?
45055,m124,lost horizon,L357231,u1894,GEORGE,We didn't get much information out of him did we Bob?
45056,m124,lost horizon,L357230,u1898,LOVETT,That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway I don't like that man. He's too vague.
45057,m124,lost horizon,L357205,u1894,GEORGE,The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
45058,m124,lost horizon,L357204,u1898,LOVETT,Now that dinner is over if you'll excuse us we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
45059,m124,lost horizon,L357147,u1898,LOVETT,English!
45060,m124,lost horizon,L357146,u1894,GEORGE,Why he's speaking English.
45061,m124,lost horizon,L357130,u1894,GEORGE,Mountain grass. It's good too. Here have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
45062,m124,lost horizon,L357129,u1898,LOVETT,What is it?
45063,m124,lost horizon,L357082,u1898,LOVETT,I don't know. I'm a paleontologist not a Foreign Secretary.
45064,m124,lost horizon,L357081,u1894,GEORGE,What do you want him to do?
45065,m124,lost horizon,L357026,u1898,LOVETT,It's Fenner.
45066,m124,lost horizon,L357025,u1894,GEORGE,Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
45067,m124,lost horizon,L357024,u1898,LOVETT,I tell you we're going west and Shanghai is east of here!
45068,m124,lost horizon,L357023,u1894,GEORGE,Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
45069,m124,lost horizon,L356938,u1898,LOVETT,How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh my word! I tell you those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
45070,m124,lost horizon,L356937,u1894,GEORGE,It would serve you right if you were left behind.
45071,m124,lost horizon,L357539,u1894,GEORGE,You'll tell me some of the things I want to know won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
45073,m124,lost horizon,L357537,u1894,GEORGE,All right I'll be there.
45075,m124,lost horizon,L357535,u1894,GEORGE,Perhaps.
45077,m124,lost horizon,L357533,u1894,GEORGE,I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
45080,m124,lost horizon,L357277,u1894,GEORGE,EXCUSE ME
49209,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393279,u2138,JEFFERSON,Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
49211,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393277,u2138,JEFFERSON,Thanks very much sonny--
49213,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393275,u2138,JEFFERSON,Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they sonny?
49215,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393273,u2138,JEFFERSON,Oh yes--they're fine people--regular people.
49217,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393271,u2138,JEFFERSON,Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
49219,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393269,u2138,JEFFERSON,Where's the Majority Leader?
49221,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393267,u2138,JEFFERSON,Not me sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
49223,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393265,u2138,JEFFERSON,Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
49225,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393873,u2138,JEFFERSON,I'm saying I didn't sign it!
49227,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393871,u2138,JEFFERSON,It couldn't be.
49229,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393869,u2138,JEFFERSON,Looks like it but--
49231,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393867,u2138,JEFFERSON,I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
49233,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393865,u2138,JEFFERSON,Never.
49235,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393863,u2138,JEFFERSON,I did not--
49237,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393857,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
49239,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393855,u2138,JEFFERSON,It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
49249,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394128,u2147,SAUNDERS,Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that State--!  Come on Diz get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
49251,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394126,u2147,SAUNDERS,What!
49253,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394124,u2147,SAUNDERS,Diz!
49254,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394036,u2147,SAUNDERS,Diz--get what he says to the people back in that State. It's up to you and the boys. Keep those wires hot. Fire away pal!
49256,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394034,u2147,SAUNDERS,The war's on!
49257,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393892,u2147,SAUNDERS,Well then that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
49258,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393890,u2147,SAUNDERS,You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
49260,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393888,u2147,SAUNDERS,Why me?
49261,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393886,u2147,SAUNDERS,I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
49263,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393736,u2147,SAUNDERS,Take me home Diz.
49265,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393734,u2147,SAUNDERS,Huh?
49267,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393719,u2147,SAUNDERS,Right now--everything I own--!
49269,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393717,u2147,SAUNDERS,I'm getting out of there. Right now Diz. Right now. Bonus or no bonus. I'm gonna clear outa that office-- everything I own--my extra hat-- everything--
49271,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393715,u2147,SAUNDERS,I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No sir.
49273,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393713,u2147,SAUNDERS,Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that huh?
49275,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393711,u2147,SAUNDERS,You don't know a name off-hand you like better do you Diz?
49277,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393645,u2147,SAUNDERS,They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
49279,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393577,u2147,SAUNDERS,That's taking place outside now.
49281,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393575,u2147,SAUNDERS,Did you like the first act?
49282,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393559,u2147,SAUNDERS,Diz--Don Quixote with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak two important words--*Willet Creek*. When that happens--if my hunch is right--the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and Puss will jump out of his boots.
49284,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393557,u2147,SAUNDERS,You play--left field.
49286,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393555,u2147,SAUNDERS,The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
49288,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393552,u2147,SAUNDERS,That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
49290,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393550,u2147,SAUNDERS,Ah. One of the supporting characters.
49291,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393548,u2147,SAUNDERS,Certainly.  Now there's the principal actor in our little play.
49293,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393546,u2147,SAUNDERS,Sit tight Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
49294,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393186,u2147,SAUNDERS,Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me friend--I've got some telephoning to do--!

49516,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393995,u2138,JEFFERSON,I will not yield sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
49517,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393994,u2144,PAINE,Will the Senator--
49518,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393990,u2144,PAINE,The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
49519,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393989,u2138,JEFFERSON,I have no defense against forged papers and--
49520,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393988,u2144,PAINE,I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
49521,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393987,u2138,JEFFERSON,Mr. President--
49522,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393986,u2144,PAINE,Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
49523,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393985,u2138,JEFFERSON,It does!
49524,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393984,u2144,PAINE,Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
49525,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393983,u2138,JEFFERSON,For a *question*.
49526,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393982,u2144,PAINE,Will he *yield*?
49527,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393981,u2138,JEFFERSON,Ah now that's better.
49528,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393980,u2144,PAINE,Will he yield for a question?
49529,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393979,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yield *how* sir?
49530,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393827,u2144,PAINE,Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that out of evidence that has come to my attention I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
49531,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393826,u2138,JEFFERSON,Y-yes.
49532,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393741,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yes--the *benefits*! What's a man called Taylor got to do with this?
49533,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393740,u2144,PAINE,Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
49534,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393739,u2138,JEFFERSON,But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
49535,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393738,u2144,PAINE,Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
49536,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393737,u2138,JEFFERSON,--I may not know much about a lot of things sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
49537,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393379,u2138,JEFFERSON,Goodnight Miss Paine.
49538,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393378,u2144,PAINE,Goodnight Jeff.
49539,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393377,u2138,JEFFERSON,Well--goodnight.
49540,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393376,u2144,PAINE,Good as new! It's quite all right--
49541,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393375,u2138,JEFFERSON,Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage I'll--
49542,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393374,u2144,PAINE,That's all right my boy--don't bother--
49543,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393373,u2138,JEFFERSON,I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
49544,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393358,u2138,JEFFERSON,Well I'm sort of anxious to get back to the office--
49545,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393357,u2144,PAINE,Here--where are you running off to?
49546,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393356,u2138,JEFFERSON,Thank you sir. Thank you for your time.
49547,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393355,u2144,PAINE,Nonsense Jeff.
49548,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393354,u2138,JEFFERSON,I will sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew if any man could help me--
49549,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393353,u2144,PAINE,What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
49550,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393352,u2138,JEFFERSON,Senator Paine if I could do just that one thing while I'm here I-- I'd feel that I--
49551,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393351,u2144,PAINE,Well why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
49552,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393350,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yes I was--
49553,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393349,u2144,PAINE,Jeff look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
49554,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393348,u2138,JEFFERSON,Well then--I--I don't feel I can stay sir.
49555,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393347,u2144,PAINE,The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why after twenty years I can't understand half of them myself. No really Jeff--in your own interests--
49556,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393346,u2138,JEFFERSON,I mean sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
49557,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392980,u2144,PAINE,No.
49558,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392979,u2138,JEFFERSON,I know. I suppose Mr. Paine when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that one man by himself can't get very far can he?
49559,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392978,u2144,PAINE,Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
49560,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392977,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yes Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
49561,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392976,u2144,PAINE,His last fight was his best Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know they tried everything bribery intimidation then--well--
49562,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392975,u2138,JEFFERSON,Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
49563,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392974,u2144,PAINE,You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team the two of us a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes they used to call us.
49564,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392973,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yeah Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
49565,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392972,u2144,PAINE,Even to the hat. Same old dreamer too. One look at you and I can see him back of his old roll top desk hat and all getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith editor and publisher and champion of lost causes.
49566,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392971,u2138,JEFFERSON,Thank you sir.
49567,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392969,u2138,JEFFERSON,Well it isn't much but if you insist here's this week's. 
49568,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394193,u2138,JEFFERSON,We'd better see.
49570,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394191,u2138,JEFFERSON,How's Amos Ma?
49572,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394189,u2138,JEFFERSON,And Senator Paine too Ma--we'd like to have him--
49574,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394187,u2138,JEFFERSON,Hello Ma.  Clarissa Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
49577,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392935,u2138,JEFFERSON,Now Amos now--  What?
49578,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392922,u2138,JEFFERSON,Sorry about this Governor. But it won't take a minute. You were saying something in the other room sir--
49580,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392920,u2138,JEFFERSON,Now now now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip Ma!
49582,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392915,u2138,JEFFERSON,Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet fellows!
49583,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392911,u2138,JEFFERSON,Gosh! You see sir--I was fixing some plaster for a cast on Amos' leg-- he's always chewing 'em off. I'll only be a minute--if you'll excuse me sir--
49585,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392909,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yes Ma?
49587,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392907,u2138,JEFFERSON,Oh now--
49589,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392895,u2138,JEFFERSON,Good evening sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
49590,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393798,u2138,JEFFERSON,You're a liar!
49591,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393797,u2151,TAYLOR,Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
49592,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393796,u2138,JEFFERSON,You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
49593,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393795,u2151,TAYLOR,Can't you?
49594,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393788,u2151,TAYLOR,Mine? Why--naturally--whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me--owning a lot of its industry-- newspapers and other odds and ends. And if I thought you had the welfare of the state at heart like myself-- for instance if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way-- why I'd say you were a man to watch. For a fellow your age you'd be in a spot to make a great start in life. If you liked business--you could pick any job in the state and go right to the top. Or politics. If you like being a Senator. No reason why you couldn't come back to that Senate for the rest of your life.
49595,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393787,u2138,JEFFERSON,What is your interest in this Mr. Taylor?
49596,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393786,u2151,TAYLOR,But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
49597,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393785,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yes so I was told Mr. Taylor but--
49598,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393784,u2151,TAYLOR,Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
49599,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393783,u2138,JEFFERSON,Like what Mr. Taylor?
49600,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393782,u2151,TAYLOR,Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
49601,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394195,u2138,JEFFERSON,Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
49602,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394194,u2147,SAUNDERS,Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
49603,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393943,u2147,SAUNDERS,To a hard night's work son. Come on! 
49604,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393942,u2138,JEFFERSON,Where do we go from here?
49605,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393941,u2147,SAUNDERS,Hurray!
49606,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393940,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yay!
49607,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393939,u2147,SAUNDERS,We'll *find* one! Only throw compromise out of the window--stick to Jeff Smith the man who first came to this town--get up and *fight*-- and we'll find *some* way. I don't know where we'll wind up--but the flag'll be flying--!
49608,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393938,u2138,JEFFERSON,Saunders--if there was *any* way--
49609,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393937,u2147,SAUNDERS,Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain decent uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
49610,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393936,u2138,JEFFERSON,Oh--Saunders--
49611,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393935,u2147,SAUNDERS,I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
49612,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393934,u2138,JEFFERSON,But--I've done everything I--
49613,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393933,u2147,SAUNDERS,What you *have* to do is fight!
49614,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393932,u2138,JEFFERSON,Wait--
49615,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393931,u2147,SAUNDERS,I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
49616,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393930,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
49617,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393929,u2147,SAUNDERS,Well I guess it's a chance.
49618,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393928,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
49619,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393927,u2147,SAUNDERS,It might save some of the pieces Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over this way.
49620,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393925,u2138,JEFFERSON,I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
49621,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393924,u2147,SAUNDERS,What are you going to do?
49622,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393923,u2138,JEFFERSON,That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
49623,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393922,u2147,SAUNDERS,No. That night--I--well *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother that's all--
49624,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393921,u2147,SAUNDERS,I'm not.
49625,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393920,u2138,JEFFERSON,Well gee--how--how've you been Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in-- . I suppose--now that you're married--
49626,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393919,u2138,JEFFERSON,Saunders--
49627,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393918,u2147,SAUNDERS,Hello.
49628,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393728,u2138,JEFFERSON,Are you drunk?
49629,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393727,u2147,SAUNDERS,And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
49630,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393726,u2138,JEFFERSON,Saunders--!
49631,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393630,u2138,JEFFERSON,Wow!
49632,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393629,u2147,SAUNDERS,Get your hat Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
49633,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393628,u2138,JEFFERSON,*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes Miss Paine... How-- how are you Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
49634,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393627,u2147,SAUNDERS,Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
49635,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393616,u2138,JEFFERSON,I mean it. I--without you I could't've--
49636,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393615,u2147,SAUNDERS,Don't mention it--
49637,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393614,u2138,JEFFERSON,I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
49638,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393613,u2138,JEFFERSON,Oh--*Saunders*!
49639,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393612,u2147,SAUNDERS,Thanks a lot.
49640,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393611,u2138,JEFFERSON,The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
49641,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393610,u2147,SAUNDERS,Do you want to dictate them?
49642,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393609,u2138,JEFFERSON,No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
49643,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393608,u2147,SAUNDERS,Not another bill?
49644,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393607,u2138,JEFFERSON,Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
49645,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393606,u2147,SAUNDERS,Second drawer.
49646,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393604,u2147,SAUNDERS,Oh those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
49647,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393603,u2138,JEFFERSON,Already? All these letters?
49648,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393602,u2147,SAUNDERS,Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
49649,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393601,u2138,JEFFERSON,Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
49650,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393600,u2147,SAUNDERS,Must have been tickled pink.
49651,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393599,u2138,JEFFERSON,I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
49652,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393598,u2147,SAUNDERS,Great.
49653,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393597,u2138,JEFFERSON,No--not today! Boy I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
49654,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393596,u2147,SAUNDERS,One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers cranks people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
49655,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393595,u2138,JEFFERSON,What do they--? Who are all those--?
49656,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393544,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yeah. This land to be bought by contributions from the boys. You have that. Money to be--
49657,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393542,u2138,JEFFERSON,Well--no. I didn't. Why?
49658,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393541,u2147,SAUNDERS,No I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
49659,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393540,u2138,JEFFERSON,You couldn't. You've never been out there you said.
49660,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393539,u2147,SAUNDERS,No--
49661,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393538,u2138,JEFFERSON,You--don't know it do you?
49662,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393537,u2147,SAUNDERS,In Terry Canyon?
49663,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393536,u2138,JEFFERSON,Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
49664,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393532,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yes. The most beautiful I think I ever--gee--  Say--we're *never* going to finish this thing! Now here we go Saunders. I'm going to talk faster'n you can write--
49665,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393531,u2147,SAUNDERS,And a beautiful woman too--don't you think?
49666,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393530,u2138,JEFFERSON,Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
49667,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393529,u2147,SAUNDERS,Now *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
49668,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393528,u2138,JEFFERSON,Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well Saunders--let's go--
49669,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393527,u2147,SAUNDERS,You win. It's--Clarissa.
49670,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393526,u2138,JEFFERSON,I've got more. You better tell me.
49671,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393525,u2147,SAUNDERS,No! Stop it!
49672,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393524,u2138,JEFFERSON,Lena.
49673,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393523,u2147,SAUNDERS,No!
49674,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393522,u2138,JEFFERSON,Letitia.
49675,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393521,u2147,SAUNDERS,No!
49676,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393520,u2138,JEFFERSON,Abigail.
49677,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393519,u2147,SAUNDERS,It *is* not!
49678,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393518,u2138,JEFFERSON,I know. It's--Violet.
49679,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393517,u2147,SAUNDERS,Well if it's all the same to you--
49680,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393516,u2138,JEFFERSON,All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
49681,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393515,u2147,SAUNDERS,Look--I think we ought to skip it.
49682,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393514,u2138,JEFFERSON,You--you've *got* a first name haven't you?
49683,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393513,u2147,SAUNDERS,I also answer to whistles.
49684,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393512,u2138,JEFFERSON,Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
49685,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393511,u2147,SAUNDERS,Why?
49686,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393509,u2147,SAUNDERS,Terrible thank you.
49687,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393508,u2138,JEFFERSON,Saunders. That's better.  Good morning Saunders. Hello Saunders. How's the bill coming Saunders--?
49688,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393507,u2147,SAUNDERS,Go right ahead.
49689,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393505,u2147,SAUNDERS,I don't see where we are *with* it.
49690,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393504,u2138,JEFFERSON,I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
49691,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393503,u2147,SAUNDERS,Have I?
49692,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393502,u2138,JEFFERSON,But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
49693,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393501,u2147,SAUNDERS,No complaints.
49694,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393500,u2138,JEFFERSON,It hasn't been easy has it?
49695,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393499,u2147,SAUNDERS,No they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this Senator?
49696,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393498,u2138,JEFFERSON,I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
49697,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393497,u2147,SAUNDERS,Since sixteen or so.
49698,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393496,u2138,JEFFERSON,Have you always had to--work?
49699,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393495,u2147,SAUNDERS,City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
49700,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393494,u2138,JEFFERSON,But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
49701,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393493,u2147,SAUNDERS,Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
49702,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393492,u2138,JEFFERSON,You mean--here?
49703,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393489,u2138,JEFFERSON,I've been over every foot of it. You couldn't have any idea. You'd have to see for yourself--  --the prairies--the wind leaning on the tall grass--
49704,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393488,u2147,SAUNDERS,No.
49705,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393487,u2138,JEFFERSON,About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains prairie land trees streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there do you Miss Saunders?
49706,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393486,u2147,SAUNDERS,Now this camp is going to be out in your state of course--
49707,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393485,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yes yes--
49708,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393484,u2147,SAUNDERS,Uh--getting back to this Senator--
49709,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393483,u2138,JEFFERSON,We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
49710,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393482,u2147,SAUNDERS,He did?
49711,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393481,u2138,JEFFERSON,Well anyway it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man Miss Saunders isn't he? He knew my father you know.
49712,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393480,u2147,SAUNDERS,But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
49713,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393476,u2147,SAUNDERS,On paper?
49714,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393473,u2138,JEFFERSON,And something else too Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
49715,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393472,u2147,SAUNDERS,Now let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
49716,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393471,u2138,JEFFERSON,I did--and--and I got right up.
49717,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393470,u2147,SAUNDERS,Try sitting down.
49718,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393469,u2138,JEFFERSON,Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
49719,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393468,u2147,SAUNDERS,Yes Senator--*twice*.
49720,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393467,u2138,JEFFERSON,--that's the main idea Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that huh?
49721,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393451,u2138,JEFFERSON,And a *lot* of paper!
49722,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393450,u2147,SAUNDERS,Thanks very much.
49723,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393449,u2138,JEFFERSON,No! Go right ahead Miss Saunders.
49724,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393448,u2147,SAUNDERS,Yes--sure. Why not?  You don't mind if I take the time to get a pencil?
49725,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393447,u2138,JEFFERSON,I said--shall we get started *now* or--
49726,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393446,u2147,SAUNDERS,Pardon?
49727,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393445,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
49728,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393444,u2147,SAUNDERS,Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection it comes to a vote. Yes sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten they vote it down.  Are you catching on Senator?
49729,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393443,u2138,JEFFERSON,We're over in the House.
49730,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393442,u2147,SAUNDERS,Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
49731,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393441,u2138,JEFFERSON,*This* is.
49732,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393440,u2147,SAUNDERS,A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
49733,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393439,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
49734,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393438,u2147,SAUNDERS,Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
49735,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393437,u2138,JEFFERSON,The Steering Committee.
49736,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393436,u2147,SAUNDERS,What?
49737,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393435,u2138,JEFFERSON,What's that?
49738,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393434,u2147,SAUNDERS,That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
49739,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393433,u2138,JEFFERSON,Calendar?
49740,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393432,u2147,SAUNDERS,Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more changed amended or whatever. Days are going by Senator. Days--weeks. Finally they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
49741,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393431,u2138,JEFFERSON,Some committee's got it.
49742,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393430,u2147,SAUNDERS,Good. Where are we?
49743,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393429,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yes I see that.
49744,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393428,u2147,SAUNDERS,Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
49745,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393427,u2138,JEFFERSON,Why?
49746,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393426,u2147,SAUNDERS,That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
49747,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393425,u2138,JEFFERSON,Why?
49748,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393424,u2147,SAUNDERS,Committee.
49749,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393423,u2138,JEFFERSON,Committee huh?
49750,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393422,u2147,SAUNDERS,You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
49751,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393421,u2138,JEFFERSON,How?
49752,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393420,u2147,SAUNDERS,Uh-huh. Well dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
49753,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393419,u2138,JEFFERSON,Oh--dinner. Yes. Well I'm hungry too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know like big executives who eat off trays. You see we've got to light into this and get it going--
49754,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393418,u2147,SAUNDERS,Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining Senator--but in all civilized countries there's an institution called *dinner*--!
49755,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393417,u2138,JEFFERSON,Tonight.
49756,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393416,u2147,SAUNDERS,A *day*!
49757,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393415,u2138,JEFFERSON,Oh just a day--
49758,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393414,u2147,SAUNDERS,Oh yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
49759,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393413,u2138,JEFFERSON,And with your help--
49760,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393412,u2147,SAUNDERS,I see. *This* one is so simple--
49761,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393411,u2138,JEFFERSON,Oh but this one is so simple.
49762,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393410,u2147,SAUNDERS,Fine. Now what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where when why how--and everything else. That takes time--
49763,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393409,u2138,JEFFERSON,Right.
49764,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393408,u2147,SAUNDERS,If I were *triplets* I couldn't--. Look Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
49765,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393407,u2138,JEFFERSON,I know--but you--you're going to help.
49766,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393406,u2147,SAUNDERS,My dear Senator have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
49767,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393405,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
49768,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393404,u2147,SAUNDERS,Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
49769,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393403,u2138,JEFFERSON,Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
49770,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393402,u2147,SAUNDERS,One moment Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
49771,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393401,u2138,JEFFERSON,Why the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
49772,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393400,u2147,SAUNDERS,We're going right ahead with--*what*?
49773,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393399,u2138,JEFFERSON,Well then I--I *thank* you Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir* Miss Saunders we're going right ahead with it!
49774,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393398,u2147,SAUNDERS,I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
49775,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393397,u2138,JEFFERSON,Punch?
49776,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393396,u2147,SAUNDERS,Go ahead--punch.
49777,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393153,u2138,JEFFERSON,I mean--gosh--I wouldn't be comfortable in a--I--I haven't got clothes and things like that--and--I couldn't keep pigeons *there*--No--I-- I just--just wouldn't be--
49778,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393152,u2147,SAUNDERS,You *couldn't*?
49779,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393151,u2138,JEFFERSON,No gee--I couldn't stay here--
49780,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393147,u2147,SAUNDERS,Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
49781,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393146,u2138,JEFFERSON,Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
49782,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393145,u2147,SAUNDERS,No. What had you better--?
49783,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393144,u2138,JEFFERSON,Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
49784,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393143,u2147,SAUNDERS,With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
49785,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393142,u2138,JEFFERSON,Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
49786,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393141,u2147,SAUNDERS,Convene?
49787,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393140,u2138,JEFFERSON,Tell me Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
49788,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393139,u2147,SAUNDERS,You--uh--you better relax Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
49789,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393138,u2138,JEFFERSON,The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
49790,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393137,u2147,SAUNDERS,I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
49791,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393136,u2138,JEFFERSON,Whose statue is that?
49792,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393135,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
49793,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393134,u2147,SAUNDERS,Now if you're ready Senator we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
49794,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393133,u2147,SAUNDERS,Well--he's got nothing on me.
49795,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393132,u2138,JEFFERSON,I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
49796,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393131,u2147,SAUNDERS,Most natural thing in the world!
49797,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393130,u2138,JEFFERSON,--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
49798,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393129,u2138,JEFFERSON,The Dome--the Capitol Dome--
49799,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393128,u2147,SAUNDERS,There *what* was?
49800,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393127,u2138,JEFFERSON,One of those sightseers--you know. You see I--gosh I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
49801,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393126,u2147,SAUNDERS,Did you say--bus?
49802,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393125,u2138,JEFFERSON,Gee I'm sorry. You see it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
49803,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393121,u2138,JEFFERSON,Pleased to meet you sir.
49804,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393120,u2147,SAUNDERS,Yes I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator* Mr. Moore.
49805,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393119,u2138,JEFFERSON,Gee--I'm sorry about that Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders aren't you?
49806,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393118,u2147,SAUNDERS,Oh no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
49807,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393117,u2138,JEFFERSON,Is--is something the matter?
49808,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393113,u2138,JEFFERSON,J-Jefferson Smith.
49809,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393112,u2147,SAUNDERS,What's your name?
49810,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393110,u2147,SAUNDERS,No!
49811,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393109,u2138,JEFFERSON,The man downstairs said number--
49812,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393108,u2147,SAUNDERS,*No*!
49813,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393107,u2138,JEFFERSON,Office of--Senator Smith?
49814,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393106,u2147,SAUNDERS,What is it?
49815,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393332,u2138,JEFFERSON,If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
49817,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393321,u2138,JEFFERSON,That's what I said--the *truth*!
49818,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393319,u2138,JEFFERSON,*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
49819,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393214,u2138,JEFFERSON,You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
49821,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393212,u2138,JEFFERSON,Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
49823,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393200,u2138,JEFFERSON,Hold on fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
49825,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393643,u2138,JEFFERSON,No! No! Gosh. See there you are! I'm not making sense!
49828,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393639,u2138,JEFFERSON,It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
49830,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393637,u2138,JEFFERSON,Oh the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
49832,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393635,u2138,JEFFERSON,That's--that's splendid.
49834,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393633,u2138,JEFFERSON,Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
49836,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393631,u2138,JEFFERSON,I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
49838,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393369,u2138,JEFFERSON,Well goodbye sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you Miss Paine--
49839,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393368,u2138,JEFFERSON,No--I mean--yes--that is--
49841,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393366,u2138,JEFFERSON,Oh--you are!
49843,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393364,u2138,JEFFERSON,Fine--they're fine.  Oh Miss Paine I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
49845,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393362,u2138,JEFFERSON,How--how do you do Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
49847,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393018,u2138,JEFFERSON,Sure.
49849,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393003,u2138,JEFFERSON,Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time I am going to enter in the nationals.
49851,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394109,u2138,JEFFERSON,Well now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?
49854,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393992,u2138,JEFFERSON,Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
49857,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393965,u2138,JEFFERSON,You were about to recognize me sir--
49859,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393820,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yes sir--
49861,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393565,u2138,JEFFERSON,I--I'm sorry sir. I--I have a bill--
49865,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393306,u2138,JEFFERSON,I don't understand sir! I don't know what the gentleman--
49867,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393066,u2138,JEFFERSON,Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
49869,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393064,u2138,JEFFERSON,I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
49871,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393062,u2138,JEFFERSON,Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
49872,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393223,u2138,JEFFERSON,Well--I can *manage*--
49875,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393216,u2138,JEFFERSON,Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
49877,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393210,u2138,JEFFERSON,Well--I have got *one* idea--
49879,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393208,u2138,JEFFERSON,Ax?
49881,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393202,u2138,JEFFERSON,Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
49883,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393457,u2147,SAUNDERS,Why he's a Senator isn't he? I'm surprised at you Mister McGann-- 
49886,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393454,u2147,SAUNDERS,The Head Man's writing a Bill.
49888,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393452,u2147,SAUNDERS,I wouldn't wait if I were you.
49890,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393389,u2147,SAUNDERS,My my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
49892,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393387,u2147,SAUNDERS,That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
49894,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393385,u2147,SAUNDERS,How'd you like a punch in the nose?
49896,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393881,u2144,PAINE,Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
49898,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393760,u2144,PAINE,--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
49900,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393758,u2144,PAINE,--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
49902,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393591,u2144,PAINE,Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
49904,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393589,u2144,PAINE,My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
49906,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393587,u2144,PAINE,That won't work Chick. This boy's honest not stupid.
49908,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393585,u2144,PAINE,I know that.
49910,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393583,u2144,PAINE,Be quiet Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
49912,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393581,u2144,PAINE,--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
49914,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393579,u2144,PAINE,Let's get away from here. 
49916,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393465,u2144,PAINE,Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down Chick--and--goodnight.
49918,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393460,u2144,PAINE,What's the matter?
49921,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393162,u2144,PAINE,Eleven B Street Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
49923,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393020,u2144,PAINE,Chick--
49924,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393010,u2144,PAINE,Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
49927,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392996,u2144,PAINE,Here Jeff I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
49929,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392987,u2144,PAINE,You can't find it in racing forms Chick.
49931,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393181,u2147,SAUNDERS,Well that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
49933,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393179,u2147,SAUNDERS,Look Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this wouldn't they?
49934,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393175,u2147,SAUNDERS,Well well!
49937,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393170,u2147,SAUNDERS,Go away Nosey.
49939,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394175,u2147,SAUNDERS,He did it.
49940,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394174,u2144,PAINE,Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
49941,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393910,u2147,SAUNDERS,So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did *anything* I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!
49942,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393909,u2144,PAINE,It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
49943,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393908,u2147,SAUNDERS,*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
49944,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393907,u2144,PAINE,I thought I could too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
49945,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393906,u2147,SAUNDERS,All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
49946,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393905,u2144,PAINE,Do you?
49947,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393904,u2147,SAUNDERS,What are you talking about? What difference--?
49948,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393903,u2144,PAINE,But--you love him don't you Saunders?
49949,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393902,u2147,SAUNDERS,Well--me too!
49950,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393901,u2144,PAINE,He's lost complete faith in me--
49951,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393900,u2147,SAUNDERS,Why don't you do it yourself?
49952,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393899,u2144,PAINE,Yes--
49953,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393898,u2147,SAUNDERS,What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
49954,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393897,u2144,PAINE,Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
49955,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393896,u2147,SAUNDERS,What do you want Senator?
49956,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393261,u2144,PAINE,I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
49957,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393260,u2147,SAUNDERS,Well when I first came to Washington my eyes were big blue question marks-- now they're big green dollar marks--
49958,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393259,u2144,PAINE,What do you mean?
49959,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393258,u2147,SAUNDERS,Yeah?  And what else?
49960,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393257,u2144,PAINE,You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
49961,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393256,u2147,SAUNDERS,Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
49962,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393255,u2144,PAINE,You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So you see--
49963,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393254,u2147,SAUNDERS,And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
49964,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393253,u2144,PAINE,You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
49965,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393252,u2147,SAUNDERS,No?
49966,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393251,u2144,PAINE,I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
49967,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393250,u2147,SAUNDERS,Nice *compliment*!
49968,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393249,u2144,PAINE,You're the best nurse I can think of--
49969,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393248,u2147,SAUNDERS,Look Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
49970,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393247,u2144,PAINE,Oh now--that won't do--
49971,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393246,u2147,SAUNDERS,That's right.
49972,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393245,u2144,PAINE,Well--that's very fine.  Saunders some person in your office says you've quit--
49973,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393244,u2147,SAUNDERS,Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
49974,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393243,u2144,PAINE,By the way Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
49975,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393242,u2147,SAUNDERS,No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
49976,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393241,u2144,PAINE,No?
49977,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393240,u2147,SAUNDERS,The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
49978,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393239,u2144,PAINE,Yes. Good morning Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
49979,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393238,u2147,SAUNDERS,You want to see me Senator?
49980,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394053,u2151,TAYLOR,Keep doing it! This is the whole works Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
49981,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394052,u2144,PAINE,I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
49982,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394051,u2151,TAYLOR,He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
49983,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394050,u2144,PAINE,And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
49984,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394049,u2151,TAYLOR,Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
49985,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394048,u2144,PAINE,Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
49986,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393884,u2144,PAINE,No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
49987,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393883,u2151,TAYLOR,Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
49988,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393807,u2151,TAYLOR,But--if he *does* Joe--
49989,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393806,u2144,PAINE,Maybe he won't get up.
49990,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393805,u2151,TAYLOR,Anything *better* to offer?
49991,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393804,u2144,PAINE,It's crucifying him--!
49992,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393803,u2151,TAYLOR,It's in your lap Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
49993,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393792,u2151,TAYLOR,*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
49994,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393791,u2144,PAINE,You can't say *that* to--
49995,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393790,u2151,TAYLOR,Just a minute Joe!
49996,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393789,u2144,PAINE,Jim!
49997,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393779,u2144,PAINE,Congressmen Radner Schultz Diggs--
49998,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393778,u2151,TAYLOR,Glad to know you Senator. Meet the boys--
49999,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393777,u2144,PAINE,Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
50000,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393775,u2151,TAYLOR,I'm glad to see you come to your senses. You had me scared there for a minute thought.  Let him in.
50001,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393774,u2144,PAINE,Jim it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
50002,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393773,u2151,TAYLOR,Oh it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame though to part company like this after all these years especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense that's all. In the meantime you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation and if he can't find enough facts to break you with you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
50003,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393772,u2144,PAINE,Jim you don't have to--
50004,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393771,u2151,TAYLOR,Oh I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul is that it Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years Joe since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator and now you can't stand it. Well maybe you won't have to stand it Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
50005,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393770,u2144,PAINE,I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
50006,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393769,u2151,TAYLOR,You won't stand for it?
50007,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393768,u2144,PAINE,Jim I won't stand for it.
50008,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393767,u2151,TAYLOR,Well what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
50009,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393766,u2144,PAINE,Oh Jim that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
50010,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393765,u2151,TAYLOR,Steamroller stuff Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now haven't they?
50011,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393764,u2144,PAINE,Jim you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator however it happened he's a Senator. This is Washington.
50012,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393763,u2151,TAYLOR,What do you think?
50013,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393762,u2144,PAINE,Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
50014,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393761,u2151,TAYLOR,That's him. Let him in.
50015,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392955,u2151,TAYLOR,Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
50016,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392954,u2144,PAINE,A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
50017,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392953,u2151,TAYLOR,Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
50018,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392952,u2144,PAINE,Wait a minute boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington and as Happy says you make political capital out of it at home.
50019,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392798,u2151,TAYLOR,Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders. Come on--
50020,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392797,u2144,PAINE,Well then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
50021,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392796,u2151,TAYLOR,We can't drop it now Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No Joe in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
50022,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392795,u2144,PAINE,Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
50023,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392794,u2151,TAYLOR,Joe that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
50024,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392793,u2151,TAYLOR,Joe--what's the matter with you-- where you're concerned I wouldn't take the slightest risk--'specially now after the great reputation you've made in the Senate. Why look at this campaign I've started for you in all my papers. You're the logical man from the West on the National ticket--at the convention anything can happen--
50025,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392792,u2144,PAINE,I know but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
50026,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392791,u2151,TAYLOR,Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
50027,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392790,u2144,PAINE,How much does the Willet Dam mean to you Jim?
50028,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392789,u2151,TAYLOR,That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
50029,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392788,u2144,PAINE,Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
50030,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392787,u2151,TAYLOR,That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
50031,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392786,u2144,PAINE,--in other words Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
50032,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392785,u2151,TAYLOR,That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
50033,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393383,u2144,PAINE,And Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man-- these days.
50035,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393381,u2144,PAINE,Well at the expense of some of the furniture Susan--you've made another conquest.
50037,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393360,u2144,PAINE,Jefferson dropped in for a minute Susan.
50039,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393236,u2144,PAINE,Do I actually *see* this--?
50041,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393234,u2144,PAINE,His first 'whiff'!
50043,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393016,u2144,PAINE,All right we'll take Jeff with us--
50046,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L392992,u2144,PAINE,Here here Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
50047,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394166,u2144,PAINE,Page boys!
50050,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394158,u2144,PAINE,Mr. President will the Senator yield for a question?
50051,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394009,u2144,PAINE,Finally there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
50053,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394006,u2144,PAINE,--to avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable State!
50055,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L394004,u2144,PAINE,I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor a respected citizen of our State had brought with him the evidence against this man later presented from this floor and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
50056,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393999,u2144,PAINE,It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
50059,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393977,u2144,PAINE,Will the Senator yield?
50061,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393972,u2144,PAINE,Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
50062,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393294,u2144,PAINE,I present the credentials of Honorable Jefferson Smith who has just been appointed Senator by the Governor of my state.
50064,m139,mr. smith goes to washington,L393292,u2144,PAINE,Mr. President...
52577,m149,ninotchka,L420018,u2314,NINOTCHKA,From Leon.
52578,m149,ninotchka,L420015,u2314,NINOTCHKA,It's from Paris.
52581,m149,ninotchka,L419516,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Bring me forty-five back.
52583,m149,ninotchka,L419514,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Well here are fifty francs.
52584,m149,ninotchka,L419513,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Have you any money?
52586,m149,ninotchka,L419951,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
52588,m149,ninotchka,L419949,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You want this?
52590,m149,ninotchka,L419947,u2314,NINOTCHKA,What is it Anna?
52592,m149,ninotchka,L419945,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You feel it though.
52594,m149,ninotchka,L419943,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Well sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
52596,m149,ninotchka,L419941,u2314,NINOTCHKA,No my dear it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
52598,m149,ninotchka,L419939,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Yes.
52600,m149,ninotchka,L419937,u2314,NINOTCHKA,When you get up you put on a negligee and then you change to a morning frock.
52602,m149,ninotchka,L419935,u2314,NINOTCHKA,A dress you wear in the evening.
52604,m149,ninotchka,L419933,u2314,NINOTCHKA,An evening gown.
52606,m149,ninotchka,L419931,u2314,NINOTCHKA,It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
52608,m149,ninotchka,L419929,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Well a hat...
52610,m149,ninotchka,L419927,u2314,NINOTCHKA,No I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
52612,m149,ninotchka,L419925,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Thank you Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
52614,m149,ninotchka,L419923,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I see.
52617,m149,ninotchka,L419920,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I have nothing to hide.
52619,m149,ninotchka,L419918,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
52621,m149,ninotchka,L419916,u2314,NINOTCHKA,About what?
52623,m149,ninotchka,L419914,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You should be more careful Anna.
52626,m149,ninotchka,L419911,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Well I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
52628,m149,ninotchka,L419909,u2314,NINOTCHKA,An omelet.
52630,m149,ninotchka,L419907,u2314,NINOTCHKA,A few friends... just a little dinner party.
52632,m149,ninotchka,L419905,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Too bad... you missed an inspiring day Anna.
52634,m149,ninotchka,L419901,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Aren't you late?
52636,m149,ninotchka,L419899,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Good evening Anna.
52637,m149,ninotchka,L420099,u2310,KOPALSKI,Right now it's on the balcony.
52638,m149,ninotchka,L420098,u2305,BULJANOFF,...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
52639,m149,ninotchka,L420070,u2305,BULJANOFF,Imagine we don't have to whisper any longer.
52640,m149,ninotchka,L420069,u2310,KOPALSKI,We are not comrades any more... we are friends Ninotchka.
52641,m149,ninotchka,L420010,u2310,KOPALSKI,I know but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
52642,m149,ninotchka,L420009,u2305,BULJANOFF,And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
52643,m149,ninotchka,L420006,u2305,BULJANOFF,...des raisins de Madčre des framboises... 
52644,m149,ninotchka,L420005,u2310,KOPALSKI,Let's fill it with confitures des prunes...
52645,m149,ninotchka,L419994,u2305,BULJANOFF,I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Café de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
52646,m149,ninotchka,L419993,u2310,KOPALSKI,If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
52647,m149,ninotchka,L419992,u2305,BULJANOFF,It is Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread shook his head and dropped it.
52648,m149,ninotchka,L419987,u2305,BULJANOFF,That's another thing... it's spring.
52649,m149,ninotchka,L419986,u2310,KOPALSKI,Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
52650,m149,ninotchka,L419975,u2305,BULJANOFF,How nicely you've fixed the table Ninotchka.
52651,m149,ninotchka,L419974,u2310,KOPALSKI,A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
52652,m149,ninotchka,L419966,u2305,BULJANOFF,I can tell you exactly.
52653,m149,ninotchka,L419965,u2310,KOPALSKI,If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us who knows what would have happened?
52654,m149,ninotchka,L419840,u2310,KOPALSKI,That's right.
52655,m149,ninotchka,L419839,u2305,BULJANOFF,Imagine for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
52656,m149,ninotchka,L419397,u2310,KOPALSKI,Or we can't go back to Russia!
52657,m149,ninotchka,L419396,u2305,BULJANOFF,Or it might be the firing squad!
52658,m149,ninotchka,L419395,u2310,KOPALSKI,You must help us Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
52659,m149,ninotchka,L419372,u2305,BULJANOFF,Once in Petersburg I was driving down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart and Her Highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction and when I couldn't make way quick enough she spat in my face.
52660,m149,ninotchka,L419371,u2310,KOPALSKI,Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
52661,m149,ninotchka,L419370,u2305,BULJANOFF,That's her.
52662,m149,ninotchka,L419096,u2305,BULJANOFF,Positively not!
52663,m149,ninotchka,L419095,u2310,KOPALSKI,No that's not him...
52664,m149,ninotchka,L419068,u2305,BULJANOFF,Possibly.
52665,m149,ninotchka,L419067,u2310,KOPALSKI,Are we free Buljanoff?
52666,m149,ninotchka,L419061,u2305,BULJANOFF,...and little Lady Beatrice?
52667,m149,ninotchka,L419060,u2310,KOPALSKI,And how is Lord Lavenham?
52668,m149,ninotchka,L419045,u2305,BULJANOFF,He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
52669,m149,ninotchka,L419044,u2310,KOPALSKI,You wouldn't like Razinin.
52670,m149,ninotchka,L418989,u2305,BULJANOFF,All right let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
52671,m149,ninotchka,L418988,u2310,KOPALSKI,Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
52672,m149,ninotchka,L418877,u2305,BULJANOFF,I don't want to go to Siberia.
52673,m149,ninotchka,L418876,u2310,KOPALSKI,Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
52674,m149,ninotchka,L420072,u2305,BULJANOFF,No that's bad management.
52675,m149,ninotchka,L420071,u2309,IRANOFF,We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
52676,m149,ninotchka,L419999,u2309,IRANOFF,Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
52677,m149,ninotchka,L419998,u2305,BULJANOFF,And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
52678,m149,ninotchka,L419985,u2305,BULJANOFF,Just see how happy the people look... from here....
52679,m149,ninotchka,L419984,u2309,IRANOFF,She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
52680,m149,ninotchka,L419977,u2305,BULJANOFF,How many families live here with you?
52681,m149,ninotchka,L419976,u2309,IRANOFF,What a lovely room you have here.
52682,m149,ninotchka,L419964,u2309,IRANOFF,And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
52683,m149,ninotchka,L419963,u2305,BULJANOFF,Let's be happy that we're all alive.
52684,m149,ninotchka,L419960,u2309,IRANOFF,That's right... and we might as well face it.
52685,m149,ninotchka,L419959,u2305,BULJANOFF,You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
52686,m149,ninotchka,L419400,u2309,IRANOFF,Leon how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
52687,m149,ninotchka,L419399,u2305,BULJANOFF,Yes! We could stay with Leon!
52688,m149,ninotchka,L419384,u2305,BULJANOFF,What do you mean they might -- they will!
52689,m149,ninotchka,L419383,u2309,IRANOFF,And they might believe her in Moscow.
52690,m149,ninotchka,L419382,u2305,BULJANOFF,And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
52691,m149,ninotchka,L419135,u2309,IRANOFF,For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
52692,m149,ninotchka,L419134,u2305,BULJANOFF,We had to take it on account of the safe.
52693,m149,ninotchka,L419093,u2305,BULJANOFF,Yes he looks like a comrade!
52694,m149,ninotchka,L419092,u2309,IRANOFF,That must be the one!
52695,m149,ninotchka,L419080,u2305,BULJANOFF,A telegram from Moscow! It must have been here all day!
52696,m149,ninotchka,L419079,u2309,IRANOFF,What is it?
52697,m149,ninotchka,L419078,u2305,BULJANOFF,Misha! Misha!
52698,m149,ninotchka,L419047,u2305,BULJANOFF,We like you Leon -- don't we like Leon?
52699,m149,ninotchka,L419046,u2309,IRANOFF,We don't like Razinin.
52700,m149,ninotchka,L418987,u2305,BULJANOFF,But what can we do?... We have to accept.
52701,m149,ninotchka,L418986,u2309,IRANOFF,He's cutting our throat...
52702,m149,ninotchka,L418979,u2305,BULJANOFF,They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
52703,m149,ninotchka,L418978,u2309,IRANOFF,Capitalistic methods...
52704,m149,ninotchka,L418902,u2309,IRANOFF,We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
52705,m149,ninotchka,L418901,u2305,BULJANOFF,Now Comrades I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
52706,m149,ninotchka,L418875,u2309,IRANOFF,Where is your courage Comrade Buljanoff?
52707,m149,ninotchka,L418874,u2305,BULJANOFF,Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there we are on an official mission and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
52708,m149,ninotchka,L418892,u2305,BULJANOFF,Why should you be afraid?
52710,m149,ninotchka,L418890,u2305,BULJANOFF,May I ask how much your rooms are?
52712,m149,ninotchka,L418888,u2305,BULJANOFF,I am Comrade Buljanoff.
52713,m149,ninotchka,L418865,u2305,BULJANOFF,No no.
52715,m149,ninotchka,L420095,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
52716,m149,ninotchka,L420094,u2305,BULJANOFF,We are not only serving good food we are serving our country... we are making friends.
52717,m149,ninotchka,L420089,u2305,BULJANOFF,We have opened a restaurant...
52718,m149,ninotchka,L420088,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Guest?
52719,m149,ninotchka,L420085,u2305,BULJANOFF,Shall we tell her?
52720,m149,ninotchka,L420084,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
52721,m149,ninotchka,L420077,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Friends... friends Buljanoff Iranoff...
52722,m149,ninotchka,L420076,u2305,BULJANOFF,With our cream situation what it is it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
52723,m149,ninotchka,L420073,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
52724,m149,ninotchka,L420068,u2314,NINOTCHKA,But Comrades...
52725,m149,ninotchka,L420067,u2305,BULJANOFF,Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
52726,m149,ninotchka,L420066,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Don't forget the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
52727,m149,ninotchka,L420063,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I must be stern with you.
52728,m149,ninotchka,L420062,u2305,BULJANOFF,It is high time you got out of Russia.
52729,m149,ninotchka,L420003,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Don't worry... there will be enough.
52730,m149,ninotchka,L420002,u2305,BULJANOFF,Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
52731,m149,ninotchka,L419973,u2305,BULJANOFF,I think I need my glasses.
52732,m149,ninotchka,L419972,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
52733,m149,ninotchka,L419968,u2305,BULJANOFF,That's right.
52734,m149,ninotchka,L419967,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
52735,m149,ninotchka,L419509,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut Buljanoff? You all look so wintry Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well Comrades I don't think I need you any more.
52736,m149,ninotchka,L419508,u2305,BULJANOFF,There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
52737,m149,ninotchka,L419155,u2305,BULJANOFF,Yes Comrade.
52738,m149,ninotchka,L419154,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
52739,m149,ninotchka,L419153,u2305,BULJANOFF,Is there anything I can do Comrade?
52740,m149,ninotchka,L419147,u2305,BULJANOFF,With two f's if you please.
52741,m149,ninotchka,L419146,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
52742,m149,ninotchka,L419145,u2305,BULJANOFF,Yes Comrade?
52743,m149,ninotchka,L419144,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Comrade Buljanoff...
52744,m149,ninotchka,L419141,u2305,BULJANOFF,We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. They are very expensive here. If you just say hello to a lawyer... well there goes another cow.
52745,m149,ninotchka,L419140,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You didn't get legal advice?
52746,m149,ninotchka,L419139,u2305,BULJANOFF,Which lawyer?
52747,m149,ninotchka,L419125,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Which part of the room is mine?
52748,m149,ninotchka,L419124,u2305,BULJANOFF,This is the apartment we have reserved for you Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
52749,m149,ninotchka,L419120,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
52750,m149,ninotchka,L419119,u2305,BULJANOFF,How are things in Moscow?
52751,m149,ninotchka,L419402,u2305,BULJANOFF,Well if your mother turns against you you have to look for someone to adopt you.
52752,m149,ninotchka,L419401,u2312,LEON,Boys boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
52753,m149,ninotchka,L419394,u2312,LEON,Oh yes yes.
52754,m149,ninotchka,L419393,u2305,BULJANOFF,Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
52755,m149,ninotchka,L419038,u2305,BULJANOFF,Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
52756,m149,ninotchka,L419037,u2312,LEON,About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
52757,m149,ninotchka,L419031,u2312,LEON,Well gentlemen how about my proposition?
52758,m149,ninotchka,L419030,u2305,BULJANOFF,Not that we are giving in one inch but tell us... what is in your mind?
52759,m149,ninotchka,L419025,u2312,LEON,In any case gentlemen a charming beautiful exquisite woman. I warn you if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court and when the Duchess takes the stand...
52760,m149,ninotchka,L419024,u2305,BULJANOFF,The former Duchess!
52761,m149,ninotchka,L419023,u2312,LEON,The Duchess...
52762,m149,ninotchka,L419022,u2305,BULJANOFF,You think because you represent the former Duchess...
52764,m149,ninotchka,L419346,u2320,SWANA,Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
52767,m149,ninotchka,L419341,u2320,SWANA,Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
52768,m149,ninotchka,L419330,u2320,SWANA,That's all right.
52770,m149,ninotchka,L419328,u2320,SWANA,Good morning Gaston.
52774,m149,ninotchka,L419532,u2312,LEON,Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
52776,m149,ninotchka,L419530,u2312,LEON,I can't follow you Gaston isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
52778,m149,ninotchka,L419528,u2312,LEON,Ah there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane blanket blanket sheet sheet... it should be set to music!
52780,m149,ninotchka,L419526,u2312,LEON,And Gaston I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
52782,m149,ninotchka,L419524,u2312,LEON,Have you?
52784,m149,ninotchka,L419522,u2312,LEON,I am Gaston.
52786,m149,ninotchka,L419520,u2312,LEON,I guess it is eight forty-two.
52788,m149,ninotchka,L419518,u2312,LEON,What time have you Gaston?
52789,m149,ninotchka,L419340,u2312,LEON,I don't feel like any breakfast.
52791,m149,ninotchka,L419242,u2312,LEON,Go to bed.
52794,m149,ninotchka,L419232,u2312,LEON,Good evening Gaston.
52796,m149,ninotchka,L419634,u2320,SWANA,General would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
52798,m149,ninotchka,L419616,u2320,SWANA,You're looking magnificent Leon...  ...isn't he General Savitzky?
52799,m149,ninotchka,L419594,u2320,SWANA,General please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person will you please kill them at their source?
52801,m149,ninotchka,L419592,u2320,SWANA,Are they indeed? Thank you.
52803,m149,ninotchka,L419590,u2320,SWANA,Yes General Savitzky?
52805,m149,ninotchka,L419585,u2320,SWANA,Thank you Louis.
52807,m149,ninotchka,L419579,u2320,SWANA,That's perfect!
52810,m149,ninotchka,L419573,u2320,SWANA,Count d'Algout...
52812,m149,ninotchka,L419571,u2320,SWANA,Good evening Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
52814,m149,ninotchka,L420097,u2309,IRANOFF,...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
52815,m149,ninotchka,L420096,u2310,KOPALSKI,There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
52816,m149,ninotchka,L420093,u2309,IRANOFF,...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
52817,m149,ninotchka,L420092,u2310,KOPALSKI,Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht the Russia of beef Stroganoff blinis with sour cream...
52818,m149,ninotchka,L420082,u2309,IRANOFF,...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
52819,m149,ninotchka,L420081,u2310,KOPALSKI,Ninotchka we are in the magic East the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
52820,m149,ninotchka,L420080,u2309,IRANOFF,That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath but... we learned better.
52821,m149,ninotchka,L420023,u2309,IRANOFF,Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
52822,m149,ninotchka,L420022,u2310,KOPALSKI,Well I think it's getting late. Good night Ninotchka.
52823,m149,ninotchka,L420008,u2310,KOPALSKI,...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
52824,m149,ninotchka,L420007,u2309,IRANOFF,...des petites fraises des bois... de la crčme de Bretagne... 
52825,m149,ninotchka,L419971,u2309,IRANOFF,If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris.
52826,m149,ninotchka,L419970,u2310,KOPALSKI,It's a real Paris reunion.
52827,m149,ninotchka,L419969,u2309,IRANOFF,Let's do that.
52828,m149,ninotchka,L419842,u2310,KOPALSKI,While you eat you look at the view.
52829,m149,ninotchka,L419841,u2309,IRANOFF,They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
52830,m149,ninotchka,L419386,u2309,IRANOFF,We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well if you were to offer us a glass of champagne we wouldn't say no.
52831,m149,ninotchka,L419385,u2310,KOPALSKI,We don't blame you Leon but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
52832,m149,ninotchka,L419091,u2310,KOPALSKI,How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
52833,m149,ninotchka,L419090,u2309,IRANOFF,This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
52834,m149,ninotchka,L419082,u2309,IRANOFF,It is Thursday!
52835,m149,ninotchka,L419081,u2310,KOPALSKI,Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
52836,m149,ninotchka,L419040,u2310,KOPALSKI,Oh Leon you are so good.
52837,m149,ninotchka,L419039,u2309,IRANOFF,Leon my little boy.
52838,m149,ninotchka,L419036,u2309,IRANOFF,What is it my boy?
52839,m149,ninotchka,L419035,u2310,KOPALSKI,Yes Leon...
52840,m149,ninotchka,L419021,u2310,KOPALSKI,Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
52841,m149,ninotchka,L419020,u2309,IRANOFF,That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
52842,m149,ninotchka,L419008,u2309,IRANOFF,I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
52843,m149,ninotchka,L419007,u2310,KOPALSKI,We can call our ambassador.
52844,m149,ninotchka,L419003,u2310,KOPALSKI,These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana but like all private property they were confiscated by the State.
52845,m149,ninotchka,L419002,u2309,IRANOFF,You know Monsieur Mercier this is all non-sense.
52846,m149,ninotchka,L418983,u2309,IRANOFF,Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
52847,m149,ninotchka,L418982,u2310,KOPALSKI,We can wait.
52848,m149,ninotchka,L418878,u2309,IRANOFF,I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
52849,m149,ninotchka,L418873,u2309,IRANOFF,Comrades if we ring nine times... let's go in.
52850,m149,ninotchka,L418872,u2310,KOPALSKI,They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.
52851,m149,ninotchka,L418869,u2309,IRANOFF,Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
52852,m149,ninotchka,L418868,u2310,KOPALSKI,Comrades why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
52853,m149,ninotchka,L419392,u2312,LEON,No no.
52854,m149,ninotchka,L419391,u2309,IRANOFF,You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach were we?
52855,m149,ninotchka,L419381,u2309,IRANOFF,I think she covered you with the parasites.
52856,m149,ninotchka,L419380,u2312,LEON,What did she say about me?
52857,m149,ninotchka,L419379,u2309,IRANOFF,She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
52858,m149,ninotchka,L419052,u2312,LEON,I'll send you a muff.
52859,m149,ninotchka,L419051,u2309,IRANOFF,And if we have to go to Siberia...
52860,m149,ninotchka,L419043,u2312,LEON,Razinin Board of Trade Moscow.
52861,m149,ninotchka,L419042,u2309,IRANOFF,Razinin.
52862,m149,ninotchka,L419041,u2312,LEON,What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
52863,m149,ninotchka,L419033,u2312,LEON,I just said let's have a little lunch.  Room service.
52864,m149,ninotchka,L419032,u2309,IRANOFF,What proposition?
52865,m149,ninotchka,L419029,u2312,LEON,Oh no no. I am not a highwayman I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
52866,m149,ninotchka,L419028,u2309,IRANOFF,I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
52867,m149,ninotchka,L419027,u2312,LEON,But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen the judge will be French the jury will be French everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
52868,m149,ninotchka,L419026,u2309,IRANOFF,All right go ahead get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
52869,m149,ninotchka,L419015,u2312,LEON,Don't look so gloomy gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance.
52870,m149,ninotchka,L419014,u2309,IRANOFF,Get out of here!
52871,m149,ninotchka,L419013,u2312,LEON,Well gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
52872,m149,ninotchka,L418994,u2309,IRANOFF,But you can't...
52873,m149,ninotchka,L418993,u2312,LEON,I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
52874,m149,ninotchka,L418992,u2309,IRANOFF,If you want to see us you must come later.
52875,m149,ninotchka,L418991,u2312,LEON,My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
52876,m149,ninotchka,L418990,u2309,IRANOFF,We don't want to be disturbed.
52877,m149,ninotchka,L420091,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You mean you are deserting Russia?
52878,m149,ninotchka,L420061,u2309,IRANOFF,Buljanoff she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
52879,m149,ninotchka,L420060,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money not to spend it.
52880,m149,ninotchka,L420059,u2309,IRANOFF,Now please Ninotchka don't start figuring it out in cows.
52881,m149,ninotchka,L420058,u2314,NINOTCHKA,But Buljanoff Iranoff Kopalski...
52882,m149,ninotchka,L420021,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Look for yourselves.
52883,m149,ninotchka,L420020,u2309,IRANOFF,Bad news?
52884,m149,ninotchka,L419979,u2309,IRANOFF,Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
52885,m149,ninotchka,L419978,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
52886,m149,ninotchka,L419962,u2309,IRANOFF,Brave... that's right.
52887,m149,ninotchka,L419961,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Come now you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
52888,m149,ninotchka,L419505,u2309,IRANOFF,Too bad we have to waste all that time.
52889,m149,ninotchka,L419504,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Well it means another two weeks in Paris.
52890,m149,ninotchka,L419133,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows.  Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
52891,m149,ninotchka,L419132,u2309,IRANOFF,A cow?
52892,m149,ninotchka,L419131,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Do you know how much a cow costs Comrade Iranoff?
52893,m149,ninotchka,L419130,u2309,IRANOFF,A day.
52894,m149,ninotchka,L419129,u2314,NINOTCHKA,A week?
52895,m149,ninotchka,L419128,u2309,IRANOFF,Two thousand francs.
52896,m149,ninotchka,L419127,u2314,NINOTCHKA,How much does this cost?
52897,m149,ninotchka,L419104,u2309,IRANOFF,What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
52898,m149,ninotchka,L419103,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Comrade.
52899,m149,ninotchka,L419102,u2309,IRANOFF,Comrade Kopalski...
52900,m149,ninotchka,L419101,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Comrade.
52901,m149,ninotchka,L419100,u2309,IRANOFF,Comrade Buljanoff...
52902,m149,ninotchka,L419099,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova Envoy Extraordinary acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues.
52903,m149,ninotchka,L419098,u2309,IRANOFF,I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
52904,m149,ninotchka,L419097,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
52905,m149,ninotchka,L419087,u2309,IRANOFF,Right away... instantly!
52907,m149,ninotchka,L419085,u2309,IRANOFF,A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got.
52909,m149,ninotchka,L418896,u2309,IRANOFF,That's even better.
52911,m149,ninotchka,L418894,u2309,IRANOFF,Oh yes but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
52914,m149,ninotchka,L418886,u2309,IRANOFF,This is Comrade Kopalski.
52915,m149,ninotchka,L418867,u2309,IRANOFF,Just looking around.
52917,m149,ninotchka,L419390,u2310,KOPALSKI,We can't... but you are so ingenious Leon...
52918,m149,ninotchka,L419389,u2312,LEON,All right then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
52919,m149,ninotchka,L419388,u2310,KOPALSKI,She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
52920,m149,ninotchka,L419387,u2312,LEON,Well boys I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
52921,m149,ninotchka,L419378,u2310,KOPALSKI,Leon Leonitchka she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
52922,m149,ninotchka,L419377,u2312,LEON,What's new?
52923,m149,ninotchka,L419050,u2310,KOPALSKI,If we say that Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
52924,m149,ninotchka,L419049,u2312,LEON,How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin Board of Trade Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff Buljanoff and Kopalski.
52925,m149,ninotchka,L419019,u2312,LEON,All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
52926,m149,ninotchka,L419018,u2310,KOPALSKI,We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
52927,m149,ninotchka,L419017,u2312,LEON,Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
52928,m149,ninotchka,L419016,u2310,KOPALSKI,We may have a chance.
52929,m149,ninotchka,L418999,u2312,LEON,Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
52930,m149,ninotchka,L418998,u2310,KOPALSKI,Now monsieur you have no right...
52931,m149,ninotchka,L420079,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
52932,m149,ninotchka,L420078,u2310,KOPALSKI,...and Kopalski.
52933,m149,ninotchka,L419997,u2314,NINOTCHKA,We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring didn't we? We got the swallows and you will get your apfel strudel too.
52934,m149,ninotchka,L419996,u2310,KOPALSKI,Yes a good piece of apfel strudel....
52935,m149,ninotchka,L419995,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Now comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
52936,m149,ninotchka,L419989,u2310,KOPALSKI,Even the swallows are back.
52937,m149,ninotchka,L419988,u2314,NINOTCHKA,The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
52938,m149,ninotchka,L419983,u2314,NINOTCHKA,And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
52939,m149,ninotchka,L419982,u2310,KOPALSKI,Yes there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
52940,m149,ninotchka,L419981,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Sssh! Once and for all we're in Moscow!
52941,m149,ninotchka,L419980,u2310,KOPALSKI,And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
52942,m149,ninotchka,L419958,u2310,KOPALSKI,Well we're back home.
52943,m149,ninotchka,L419957,u2314,NINOTCHKA,How are you you three scoundrels?
52944,m149,ninotchka,L419511,u2314,NINOTCHKA,No not a thing. Would you like to go out?
52945,m149,ninotchka,L419510,u2310,KOPALSKI,If there is anything we can do for you...
52946,m149,ninotchka,L419507,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Oh yes Power and Light. Thank you.
52947,m149,ninotchka,L419506,u2310,KOPALSKI,I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
52948,m149,ninotchka,L419152,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You Comrade Iranoff go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
52949,m149,ninotchka,L419151,u2310,KOPALSKI,Yes Comrade.
52950,m149,ninotchka,L419150,u2314,NINOTCHKA,We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
52951,m149,ninotchka,L419149,u2310,KOPALSKI,We did it with the best intentions...
52952,m149,ninotchka,L419148,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Will you send me some cigarettes please?  Comrades I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State.  You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades...
52953,m149,ninotchka,L419143,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
52954,m149,ninotchka,L419142,u2310,KOPALSKI,We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
52955,m149,ninotchka,L419138,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I hope so for your sake.  Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?
52956,m149,ninotchka,L419137,u2310,KOPALSKI,We did our best Comrade.
52957,m149,ninotchka,L419136,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
52958,m149,ninotchka,L419122,u2310,KOPALSKI,It's a hat Comrade a woman's hat.
52959,m149,ninotchka,L419121,u2314,NINOTCHKA,What's that?
52960,m149,ninotchka,L419118,u2314,NINOTCHKA,No thank you.
52961,m149,ninotchka,L419117,u2310,KOPALSKI,Allow me Comrade.
52962,m149,ninotchka,L419113,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
52963,m149,ninotchka,L419112,u2310,KOPALSKI,He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
52964,m149,ninotchka,L419106,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
52965,m149,ninotchka,L419105,u2310,KOPALSKI,If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
52966,m149,ninotchka,L419503,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Au revoir.
52968,m149,ninotchka,L419501,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Well there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?
52970,m149,ninotchka,L419499,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I know gentlemen but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless aren't we?
52972,m149,ninotchka,L419497,u2314,NINOTCHKA,That's two weeks from Thursday...
52974,m149,ninotchka,L419495,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I'm sorry gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
52976,m149,ninotchka,L419690,u2312,LEON,You want me to go in there?
52978,m149,ninotchka,L419688,u2312,LEON,What can I do about it?
52980,m149,ninotchka,L419686,u2312,LEON,Give me another double brandy.
52981,m149,ninotchka,L419893,u2312,LEON,Suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... That's the trouble with you! If you don't let me in I'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!... I'll picket your whole country....
52983,m149,ninotchka,L419891,u2312,LEON,What for... why?
52985,m149,ninotchka,L419889,u2312,LEON,On what?
52987,m149,ninotchka,L419887,u2312,LEON,Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in you keep him out!
52989,m149,ninotchka,L419885,u2312,LEON,That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
52991,m149,ninotchka,L419883,u2312,LEON,I must get into that country of yours!
52993,m149,ninotchka,L419881,u2312,LEON,Yes!
52995,m149,ninotchka,L419879,u2312,LEON,I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
52997,m149,ninotchka,L419877,u2312,LEON,Listen I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
52999,m149,ninotchka,L419875,u2312,LEON,Believe me I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
53001,m149,ninotchka,L419873,u2312,LEON,She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
53003,m149,ninotchka,L419862,u2312,LEON,On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
53005,m149,ninotchka,L419860,u2312,LEON,Confess what?
53007,m149,ninotchka,L419858,u2312,LEON,Private.
53009,m149,ninotchka,L419856,u2312,LEON,Business.
53011,m149,ninotchka,L419854,u2312,LEON,Don't hold that against me... please!
53013,m149,ninotchka,L419852,u2312,LEON,Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
53015,m149,ninotchka,L419850,u2312,LEON,Pardon me I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
53016,m149,ninotchka,L420107,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Well when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.
53017,m149,ninotchka,L420106,u2312,LEON,If you don't stay with me I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs Iranoffs and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
53018,m149,ninotchka,L420105,u2314,NINOTCHKA,But Leon I am only here for a few days.
53019,m149,ninotchka,L420104,u2312,LEON,I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
53020,m149,ninotchka,L420102,u2312,LEON,Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way didn't I? Darling I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
53021,m149,ninotchka,L420101,u2314,NINOTCHKA,So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
53022,m149,ninotchka,L420100,u2312,LEON,They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
53023,m149,ninotchka,L419747,u2314,NINOTCHKA,So happy and so tired.
53024,m149,ninotchka,L419746,u2312,LEON,Yes sweetheart. 
53025,m149,ninotchka,L419745,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet please... wait wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy aren't we Leon?
53026,m149,ninotchka,L419744,u2312,LEON,Please.
53027,m149,ninotchka,L419743,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Thank you Leon... thank you masses.  Can I make a speech now?
53028,m149,ninotchka,L419742,u2312,LEON,It is their wish.
53029,m149,ninotchka,L419741,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Is this the wish of the masses?
53030,m149,ninotchka,L419740,u2312,LEON,I give them back to the people...  I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!
53031,m149,ninotchka,L419739,u2314,NINOTCHKA,They belong to the people.
53032,m149,ninotchka,L419738,u2312,LEON,Come sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
53033,m149,ninotchka,L419735,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Czar Peter gave it to his wife Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
53034,m149,ninotchka,L419734,u2312,LEON,Who cried that one?
53035,m149,ninotchka,L419733,u2314,NINOTCHKA,...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
53036,m149,ninotchka,L419732,u2312,LEON,...but big.
53037,m149,ninotchka,L419731,u2314,NINOTCHKA,It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things those jewels....
53038,m149,ninotchka,L419730,u2312,LEON,But I can throw it out of the window.
53039,m149,ninotchka,L419729,u2314,NINOTCHKA,There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
53040,m149,ninotchka,L419728,u2312,LEON,No no music.
53041,m149,ninotchka,L419727,u2314,NINOTCHKA,No music.
53042,m149,ninotchka,L419725,u2312,LEON,Well it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
53043,m149,ninotchka,L419724,u2314,NINOTCHKA,It's dead.
53044,m149,ninotchka,L419723,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Well then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
53045,m149,ninotchka,L419722,u2312,LEON,Yes sweetheart... all by ourselves.
53046,m149,ninotchka,L419721,u2314,NINOTCHKA,No no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone don't we?
53047,m149,ninotchka,L419720,u2312,LEON,What shall we get? The news!
53048,m149,ninotchka,L419718,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Oh yes yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see...
53049,m149,ninotchka,L419717,u2312,LEON,It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
53050,m149,ninotchka,L419716,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Radio! What is radio?
53051,m149,ninotchka,L419715,u2312,LEON,Let's turn on the radio.
53052,m149,ninotchka,L419714,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
53053,m149,ninotchka,L419713,u2312,LEON,All right.
53054,m149,ninotchka,L419712,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Much happier.
53055,m149,ninotchka,L419711,u2312,LEON,Would that make you any happier?
53056,m149,ninotchka,L419710,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon I should be stood up against the wall.
53057,m149,ninotchka,L419709,u2312,LEON,I know... it's the Russian soul.
53058,m149,ninotchka,L419708,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess darling.
53059,m149,ninotchka,L419707,u2312,LEON,Yes... a kiss... salute!
53060,m149,ninotchka,L419706,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Our salute will be a kiss.
53061,m149,ninotchka,L419705,u2312,LEON,No! No!
53062,m149,ninotchka,L419704,u2314,NINOTCHKA,...and we won't clench our fist...
53063,m149,ninotchka,L419703,u2312,LEON,No! No!
53064,m149,ninotchka,L419702,u2314,NINOTCHKA,And we won't stretch up our arms...
53065,m149,ninotchka,L419701,u2312,LEON,Right: Lovers of the world unite!
53066,m149,ninotchka,L419700,u2314,NINOTCHKA,No don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
53067,m149,ninotchka,L419699,u2312,LEON,All right we'll make it red.
53068,m149,ninotchka,L419698,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Not white darling.
53069,m149,ninotchka,L419697,u2312,LEON,Yes... a little white house.
53070,m149,ninotchka,L419696,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Are we going to build our little house?
53071,m149,ninotchka,L419695,u2312,LEON,No. Nobody will find us.
53072,m149,ninotchka,L419694,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Don't tell them where we're going sweetheart.
53073,m149,ninotchka,L419683,u2312,LEON,And I adore you Ninotchua.
53074,m149,ninotchka,L419682,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I love you my little Leonitchka!
53075,m149,ninotchka,L419681,u2312,LEON,No speech.
53076,m149,ninotchka,L419680,u2314,NINOTCHKA,No speech?
53077,m149,ninotchka,L419679,u2312,LEON,Quite right... yes yes yes but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
53078,m149,ninotchka,L419678,u2314,NINOTCHKA,They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
53079,m149,ninotchka,L419677,u2312,LEON,Now Ninotchka... please!
53080,m149,ninotchka,L419676,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Comrades! Good people of France!
53081,m149,ninotchka,L419675,u2312,LEON,But darling you can't do that.
53082,m149,ninotchka,L419674,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Don't shush me. I am People! I want to make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess!
53083,m149,ninotchka,L419673,u2312,LEON,Shhh! Shhh!
53084,m149,ninotchka,L419672,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I must talk to my brothers!
53085,m149,ninotchka,L419671,u2312,LEON,Darling darling... please!
53086,m149,ninotchka,L419670,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Comrades! Comrades!
53087,m149,ninotchka,L419669,u2312,LEON,Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
53088,m149,ninotchka,L419668,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Thursday.
53089,m149,ninotchka,L419667,u2312,LEON,What darling?
53090,m149,ninotchka,L419666,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Oh everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
53091,m149,ninotchka,L419665,u2312,LEON,You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
53092,m149,ninotchka,L419664,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
53093,m149,ninotchka,L419662,u2314,NINOTCHKA,To the loveliest story I ever heard.
53094,m149,ninotchka,L419661,u2312,LEON,You must darling.
53095,m149,ninotchka,L419660,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
53096,m149,ninotchka,L419659,u2312,LEON,No darling. I'll tell you another story a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
53097,m149,ninotchka,L419658,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Go on.
53098,m149,ninotchka,L419657,u2312,LEON,Well there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
53099,m149,ninotchka,L419656,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
53100,m149,ninotchka,L419655,u2312,LEON,A funny story?
53101,m149,ninotchka,L419654,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Quickly please... tell me one of your funny stories.
53102,m149,ninotchka,L419629,u2312,LEON,And General Savitzky.
53103,m149,ninotchka,L419628,u2314,NINOTCHKA,How do you do?
53104,m149,ninotchka,L419612,u2312,LEON,There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us Ninotchka!
53105,m149,ninotchka,L419611,u2314,NINOTCHKA,From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
53106,m149,ninotchka,L419609,u2312,LEON,From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
53107,m149,ninotchka,L419608,u2314,NINOTCHKA,It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk I had a ration of vodka in the army and now champagne.
53108,m149,ninotchka,L419607,u2312,LEON,It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
53109,m149,ninotchka,L419606,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
53110,m149,ninotchka,L419569,u2312,LEON,My darling.
53111,m149,ninotchka,L419568,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Leon don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe I couldn't stand it.
53112,m149,ninotchka,L419567,u2312,LEON,Ninotchka you're jealous.
53113,m149,ninotchka,L419566,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her so witty so glamorous...
53114,m149,ninotchka,L419565,u2312,LEON,Ninotchka I love you.
53115,m149,ninotchka,L419564,u2314,NINOTCHKA,She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world isn't she?
53116,m149,ninotchka,L419562,u2314,NINOTCHKA,When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?
53117,m149,ninotchka,L419561,u2312,LEON,I don't think so.
53118,m149,ninotchka,L419560,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Did you make any change in this room?
53119,m149,ninotchka,L419559,u2312,LEON,I promise... I swear.
53120,m149,ninotchka,L419558,u2314,NINOTCHKA,If you don't want to answer you needn't. But if you do you must tell me the truth.
53121,m149,ninotchka,L419557,u2312,LEON,Anything Ninotchka.
53122,m149,ninotchka,L419556,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Leon I would like to ask you something.
53123,m149,ninotchka,L419554,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Leon I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say which I thought nobody ever should say because I thought it didn't exist... and Leon... I can't say it...
53124,m149,ninotchka,L419553,u2312,LEON,No... go on.
53125,m149,ninotchka,L419552,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Leon you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
53126,m149,ninotchka,L419551,u2312,LEON,You see I couldn't shout that.
53127,m149,ninotchka,L419548,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
53128,m149,ninotchka,L419547,u2312,LEON,A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
53129,m149,ninotchka,L419546,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Well first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
53130,m149,ninotchka,L419544,u2314,NINOTCHKA,It's nine o'clock.
53131,m149,ninotchka,L419543,u2312,LEON,Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The son-of-a-gun made a detour!...  But he got you here.
53132,m149,ninotchka,L419542,u2314,NINOTCHKA,For twelve francs seventy-five.
53133,m149,ninotchka,L419541,u2312,LEON,You see? Life can be so simple.
53134,m149,ninotchka,L419539,u2312,LEON,You remember this room?
53135,m149,ninotchka,L419537,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I don't look too foolish?
53136,m149,ninotchka,L419490,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Yes.
53137,m149,ninotchka,L419489,u2312,LEON,He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
53138,m149,ninotchka,L419488,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Yes.
53139,m149,ninotchka,L419487,u2312,LEON,I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
53140,m149,ninotchka,L419486,u2312,LEON,So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it.
53141,m149,ninotchka,L419485,u2314,NINOTCHKA,No.
53142,m149,ninotchka,L419484,u2312,LEON,Not funny huh?
53143,m149,ninotchka,L419482,u2312,LEON,Maybe you haven't any sense of humor. Well I'll give you one more chance! Now listen!
53144,m149,ninotchka,L419481,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I don't think so.
53145,m149,ninotchka,L419480,u2312,LEON,It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
53146,m149,ninotchka,L419479,u2314,NINOTCHKA,No.
53147,m149,ninotchka,L419478,u2312,LEON,I suppose you don't think that's funny?
53148,m149,ninotchka,L419476,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I wish they had never met.
53149,m149,ninotchka,L419474,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I have never heard one.
53150,m149,ninotchka,L419473,u2312,LEON,Do you like Scotch stories?
53151,m149,ninotchka,L419472,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Probably not.
53152,m149,ninotchka,L419471,u2312,LEON,Well er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
53153,m149,ninotchka,L419470,u2314,NINOTCHKA,On which boat?
53154,m149,ninotchka,L419469,u2312,LEON,That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
53155,m149,ninotchka,L419468,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Ha! Ha! Now go back.
53156,m149,ninotchka,L419467,u2312,LEON,No I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once.
53157,m149,ninotchka,L419466,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Then you should go back to your table.
53158,m149,ninotchka,L419465,u2312,LEON,Because we are an odd couple.
53159,m149,ninotchka,L419464,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Why?
53160,m149,ninotchka,L419463,u2312,LEON,At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
53161,m149,ninotchka,L419462,u2314,NINOTCHKA,At what?
53162,m149,ninotchka,L419461,u2312,LEON,Just smile.
53163,m149,ninotchka,L419460,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Why?
53164,m149,ninotchka,L419459,u2312,LEON,Will you smile?
53165,m149,ninotchka,L419458,u2314,NINOTCHKA,What?
53166,m149,ninotchka,L419457,u2312,LEON,Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you Sergeant... smile!
53167,m149,ninotchka,L419456,u2314,NINOTCHKA,But you have now and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
53168,m149,ninotchka,L419455,u2312,LEON,Oh Ninotchka who wants to talk business. If you win the suit fine. If we win the suit better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
53169,m149,ninotchka,L419454,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff Iranoff nor Kopalski.
53170,m149,ninotchka,L419453,u2312,LEON,Must one always be after something?
53171,m149,ninotchka,L419452,u2314,NINOTCHKA,What are you after?
53172,m149,ninotchka,L419451,u2312,LEON,Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
53173,m149,ninotchka,L419445,u2312,LEON,But my dear child I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all what are any of us? Workingmen! At least those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?
53174,m149,ninotchka,L419444,u2314,NINOTCHKA,This is a place for workmen.
53175,m149,ninotchka,L419443,u2312,LEON,I always eat here.
53176,m149,ninotchka,L419442,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Then how did you get here?
53177,m149,ninotchka,L419441,u2312,LEON,I didn't follow you.
53178,m149,ninotchka,L419440,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I don't like your following me.
53179,m149,ninotchka,L419439,u2312,LEON,Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people Comrade Yakushova but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish by drinking everything with gusto by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
53180,m149,ninotchka,L419413,u2312,LEON,So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite!
53181,m149,ninotchka,L419412,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here Comrade I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
53182,m149,ninotchka,L419411,u2312,LEON,Room service speaking.
53183,m149,ninotchka,L419326,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
53184,m149,ninotchka,L419325,u2312,LEON,But Ninotchka I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
53185,m149,ninotchka,L419323,u2312,LEON,Ninotchka you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
53186,m149,ninotchka,L419322,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Then do it through my lawyer!
53187,m149,ninotchka,L419321,u2312,LEON,You know I want to...
53188,m149,ninotchka,L419320,u2314,NINOTCHKA,It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
53189,m149,ninotchka,L419319,u2312,LEON,Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
53190,m149,ninotchka,L419318,u2314,NINOTCHKA,As a representative of Moscow...
53191,m149,ninotchka,L419317,u2312,LEON,All right fight me fight me as much as you want but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
53192,m149,ninotchka,L419316,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I was sent here by my country to fight you.
53193,m149,ninotchka,L419315,u2312,LEON,I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
53194,m149,ninotchka,L419314,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Let's forget that we ever met.
53195,m149,ninotchka,L419313,u2312,LEON,Ninotchka or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
53196,m149,ninotchka,L419312,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I must go.
53197,m149,ninotchka,L419306,u2314,NINOTCHKA,But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.
53198,m149,ninotchka,L419305,u2312,LEON,Oh let it ring.
53199,m149,ninotchka,L419304,u2314,NINOTCHKA,The telephone is ringing.
53200,m149,ninotchka,L419303,u2312,LEON,Glorious analytical...
53201,m149,ninotchka,L419302,u2312,LEON,Oh my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible unromantic statistical...
53202,m149,ninotchka,L419301,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Thank you.
53203,m149,ninotchka,L419300,u2314,NINOTCHKA,No that was restful. Again.
53204,m149,ninotchka,L419299,u2312,LEON,Was that talkative?
53205,m149,ninotchka,L419297,u2312,LEON,You analyze everything out of existence. You analyze me out of existence. I won't let you. Love is not so simple. Ninotchka Ninotchka why do doves bill and coo? Why do snails coldest of all creatures circle interminably around each other? Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? Why do flowers open their petals? Oh Ninotchka Ninotchka surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing more exalting than thirst?
53206,m149,ninotchka,L419296,u2314,NINOTCHKA,It's false sentimentality.
53207,m149,ninotchka,L419295,u2312,LEON,I can't possibly think of a better reason.
53208,m149,ninotchka,L419294,u2314,NINOTCHKA,That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
53209,m149,ninotchka,L419293,u2312,LEON,It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
53210,m149,ninotchka,L419292,u2314,NINOTCHKA,It's twelve o'clock.
53211,m149,ninotchka,L419291,u2312,LEON,Do you hear that?
53212,m149,ninotchka,L419290,u2312,LEON,You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka Cogitska let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.
53213,m149,ninotchka,L419289,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
53214,m149,ninotchka,L419288,u2312,LEON,What kind of a girl are you anyway?
53215,m149,ninotchka,L419287,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. After all I'm alive.
53216,m149,ninotchka,L419286,u2312,LEON,Poor Ninotchka. Poor poor Ninotchka.
53217,m149,ninotchka,L419285,u2314,NINOTCHKA,A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
53218,m149,ninotchka,L419284,u2312,LEON,I'd love to.  Tsk tsk tsk.
53219,m149,ninotchka,L419283,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
53220,m149,ninotchka,L419282,u2312,LEON,Wounded? How?
53221,m149,ninotchka,L419281,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I was wounded before Warsaw.
53222,m149,ninotchka,L419280,u2312,LEON,The bayonet? Did you really?
53223,m149,ninotchka,L419279,u2314,NINOTCHKA,It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm but I preferred the bayonet.
53224,m149,ninotchka,L419278,u2312,LEON,I'm at a loss Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all I'm just a poor bourgeois.
53225,m149,ninotchka,L419277,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Don't do it please.
53226,m149,ninotchka,L419276,u2312,LEON,I'd like to say it a thousand times.
53227,m149,ninotchka,L419275,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You repeat yourself.
53228,m149,ninotchka,L419274,u2312,LEON,You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life Ninotchka Ninotchka...
53229,m149,ninotchka,L419273,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
53230,m149,ninotchka,L419272,u2312,LEON,What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
53231,m149,ninotchka,L419271,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
53232,m149,ninotchka,L419270,u2312,LEON,Oh I see. What do you use instead?
53233,m149,ninotchka,L419269,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological or shall we say chemical process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
53234,m149,ninotchka,L419268,u2312,LEON,Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
53235,m149,ninotchka,L419267,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
53236,m149,ninotchka,L419266,u2312,LEON,Thank you.
53237,m149,ninotchka,L419265,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Your general appearance is not distasteful.
53238,m149,ninotchka,L419264,u2312,LEON,Ninotchka do you like me just a little bit?
53239,m149,ninotchka,L419263,u2314,NINOTCHKA,That is correct.
53240,m149,ninotchka,L419262,u2312,LEON,Ni-notchka.
53241,m149,ninotchka,L419261,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
53242,m149,ninotchka,L419260,u2312,LEON,I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me it frightens me a little but it fascinates me Ninotchka.
53243,m149,ninotchka,L419259,u2314,NINOTCHKA,That is why I believe in the future of my country.
53244,m149,ninotchka,L419258,u2312,LEON,Thank you. Thank you.
53245,m149,ninotchka,L419257,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You are something we do not have in Russia.
53246,m149,ninotchka,L419256,u2312,LEON,For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
53247,m149,ninotchka,L419255,u2314,NINOTCHKA,And what do you do for mankind?
53248,m149,ninotchka,L419254,u2312,LEON,Keeping my body fit keeping my mind alert keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
53249,m149,ninotchka,L419253,u2314,NINOTCHKA,And what is your profession?
53250,m149,ninotchka,L419252,u2312,LEON,That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
53251,m149,ninotchka,L419251,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I will start with you.
53252,m149,ninotchka,L419250,u2312,LEON,Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books and here am I. Where shall we begin?
53253,m149,ninotchka,L419249,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
53254,m149,ninotchka,L419248,u2312,LEON,It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand I shall turn on the radio.
53255,m149,ninotchka,L419247,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Is that customary?
53256,m149,ninotchka,L419246,u2312,LEON,We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
53257,m149,ninotchka,L419245,u2314,NINOTCHKA,What do we do now?
53258,m149,ninotchka,L419244,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
53259,m149,ninotchka,L419243,u2312,LEON,Well may I offer you a drink or how about something to eat?
53260,m149,ninotchka,L419240,u2314,NINOTCHKA,The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed little father. We want to be alone.
53261,m149,ninotchka,L419239,u2312,LEON,No though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
53262,m149,ninotchka,L419238,u2314,NINOTCHKA,He looks sad. Do you whip him?
53263,m149,ninotchka,L419237,u2312,LEON,He takes good care of that.
53264,m149,ninotchka,L419236,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Good evening comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
53265,m149,ninotchka,L419235,u2312,LEON,Yes.
53266,m149,ninotchka,L419230,u2312,LEON,I will do my best.
53267,m149,ninotchka,L419229,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
53268,m149,ninotchka,L419228,u2312,LEON,Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
53269,m149,ninotchka,L419227,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Then you don't want me to go there.
53270,m149,ninotchka,L419226,u2312,LEON,Please don't misunderstand me...
53271,m149,ninotchka,L419225,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Does that mean that you want me to go there?
53272,m149,ninotchka,L419224,u2312,LEON,Well let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort easy to reach close to street car bus and subway...
53273,m149,ninotchka,L419223,u2314,NINOTCHKA,So that is your house?
53274,m149,ninotchka,L419222,u2312,LEON,It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
53275,m149,ninotchka,L419221,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
53276,m149,ninotchka,L419220,u2312,LEON,What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohčme... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here look....  What do you see?
53277,m149,ninotchka,L419219,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I do not deny its beauty but it is a waste of electricity.
53278,m149,ninotchka,L419218,u2312,LEON,You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!
53279,m149,ninotchka,L419217,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
53280,m149,ninotchka,L419216,u2312,LEON,I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
53281,m149,ninotchka,L419215,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Yes it is.
53282,m149,ninotchka,L419214,u2312,LEON,And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful isn't it?
53283,m149,ninotchka,L419213,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
53284,m149,ninotchka,L419211,u2312,LEON,Yes very strange.
53285,m149,ninotchka,L419210,u2314,NINOTCHKA,That's a strange angle.
53286,m149,ninotchka,L419209,u2312,LEON,Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...
53287,m149,ninotchka,L419208,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Go ahead.
53288,m149,ninotchka,L419207,u2312,LEON,The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
53289,m149,ninotchka,L419203,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Your type will soon be extinct.
53290,m149,ninotchka,L419202,u2312,LEON,A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
53291,m149,ninotchka,L419201,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
53292,m149,ninotchka,L419200,u2312,LEON,Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
53293,m149,ninotchka,L419199,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You are very sure of yourself aren't you?
53294,m149,ninotchka,L419198,u2312,LEON,Madame it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
53295,m149,ninotchka,L419197,u2314,NINOTCHKA,For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
53296,m149,ninotchka,L419196,u2312,LEON,I'll try.
53297,m149,ninotchka,L419195,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Suppress it.
53298,m149,ninotchka,L419194,u2312,LEON,I don't have to but I find it natural.
53299,m149,ninotchka,L419193,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
53300,m149,ninotchka,L419192,u2312,LEON,Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
53301,m149,ninotchka,L419191,u2314,NINOTCHKA,And where are we?
53302,m149,ninotchka,L419190,u2312,LEON,Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
53303,m149,ninotchka,L419189,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Why do you need my finger?
53304,m149,ninotchka,L419188,u2312,LEON,Now isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it!  Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger please.
53305,m149,ninotchka,L419187,u2314,NINOTCHKA,How long does it take a man to land?
53306,m149,ninotchka,L419186,u2312,LEON,Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
53307,m149,ninotchka,L419185,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
53308,m149,ninotchka,L419184,u2312,LEON,Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
53309,m149,ninotchka,L419183,u2314,NINOTCHKA,No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
53310,m149,ninotchka,L419182,u2312,LEON,Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
53311,m149,ninotchka,L419181,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north aren't we?
53312,m149,ninotchka,L419180,u2312,LEON,Love to.
53313,m149,ninotchka,L419179,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You might hold this for me.
53314,m149,ninotchka,L419178,u2312,LEON,Can I help you?
53315,m149,ninotchka,L419177,u2312,LEON,You're welcome.
53316,m149,ninotchka,L419176,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Thank you.
53317,m149,ninotchka,L419175,u2312,LEON,No.
53318,m149,ninotchka,L419174,u2314,NINOTCHKA,In other words you don't know.
53319,m149,ninotchka,L419173,u2312,LEON,Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
53320,m149,ninotchka,L419172,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
53321,m149,ninotchka,L419171,u2312,LEON,That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
53322,m149,ninotchka,L419170,u2314,NINOTCHKA,How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
53323,m149,ninotchka,L419169,u2312,LEON,What?
53324,m149,ninotchka,L419168,u2314,NINOTCHKA,At what intervals does he whistle?
53325,m149,ninotchka,L419167,u2312,LEON,Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
53326,m149,ninotchka,L419166,u2314,NINOTCHKA,How long do we have to wait here?
53327,m149,ninotchka,L419165,u2312,LEON,Gladly.
53328,m149,ninotchka,L419164,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Yes. Could you give me some information?
53329,m149,ninotchka,L419163,u2312,LEON,Me?
53330,m149,ninotchka,L419162,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You please.
53331,m149,ninotchka,L419872,u2312,LEON,Thank you Swana. You are very gracious.
53332,m149,ninotchka,L419871,u2320,SWANA,Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine and if you feel the need of a change...
53333,m149,ninotchka,L419870,u2312,LEON,That does it Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
53334,m149,ninotchka,L419869,u2320,SWANA,Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
53335,m149,ninotchka,L419868,u2312,LEON,Now please Swana.
53336,m149,ninotchka,L419867,u2320,SWANA,After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.
53337,m149,ninotchka,L419866,u2312,LEON,Hello.
53338,m149,ninotchka,L419865,u2320,SWANA,Hello Leon darling!
53339,m149,ninotchka,L419837,u2312,LEON,Do you expect me to believe that?
53340,m149,ninotchka,L419836,u2320,SWANA,She's gone Leon.
53341,m149,ninotchka,L419835,u2312,LEON,Has done what?
53342,m149,ninotchka,L419834,u2320,SWANA,Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
53343,m149,ninotchka,L419833,u2312,LEON,What is this Swana?
53344,m149,ninotchka,L419832,u2320,SWANA,The same old trouble Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop you're never on time. And now when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
53345,m149,ninotchka,L419831,u2312,LEON,I'm afraid that's what it is.
53346,m149,ninotchka,L419830,u2320,SWANA,Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
53347,m149,ninotchka,L419829,u2312,LEON,I have to be simple again Swana and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
53348,m149,ninotchka,L419828,u2320,SWANA,Say it over and over again Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible don't you?
53349,m149,ninotchka,L419827,u2312,LEON,It must be serious Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering without a blush. I'm in love Swana.
53350,m149,ninotchka,L419826,u2320,SWANA,And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
53351,m149,ninotchka,L419825,u2312,LEON,There are a hundred ways to approach it but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love Swana.
53352,m149,ninotchka,L419824,u2320,SWANA,Brutal frankness if you insist.
53353,m149,ninotchka,L419823,u2312,LEON,I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if at this moment I'm not in the least subtle?
53354,m149,ninotchka,L419822,u2320,SWANA,All right I'll listen.
53355,m149,ninotchka,L419821,u2312,LEON,This time Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
53356,m149,ninotchka,L419820,u2320,SWANA,Oh no my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty otherwise I'll...
53357,m149,ninotchka,L419819,u2312,LEON,Yes.
53358,m149,ninotchka,L419818,u2320,SWANA,Is this by any chance going to be a confession?
53359,m149,ninotchka,L419817,u2312,LEON,I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
53360,m149,ninotchka,L419816,u2320,SWANA,Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
53361,m149,ninotchka,L419815,u2312,LEON,No thanks Swana.
53362,m149,ninotchka,L419814,u2320,SWANA,Leon darling how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
53363,m149,ninotchka,L419649,u2320,SWANA,A very wise suggestion Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
53364,m149,ninotchka,L419648,u2312,LEON,Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
53365,m149,ninotchka,L419643,u2320,SWANA,I'm going Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
53366,m149,ninotchka,L419642,u2312,LEON,There's a charming crowd here tonight isn't there?
53367,m149,ninotchka,L419639,u2320,SWANA,Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
53368,m149,ninotchka,L419638,u2312,LEON,Months Swana.
53369,m149,ninotchka,L419637,u2320,SWANA,He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy didn't you Leon?
53370,m149,ninotchka,L419633,u2312,LEON,No... please...
53371,m149,ninotchka,L419632,u2320,SWANA,I've some wonderful news for you Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
53372,m149,ninotchka,L419627,u2320,SWANA,How do you do?
53373,m149,ninotchka,L419626,u2312,LEON,Not at all. Your Highness may I present Madame Yakushova?
53374,m149,ninotchka,L419625,u2320,SWANA,Am I interrupting?
53375,m149,ninotchka,L419624,u2312,LEON,Yes Swana.
53376,m149,ninotchka,L419623,u2320,SWANA,It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything but I was right wasn't I?
53377,m149,ninotchka,L419622,u2312,LEON,Yes Swana you did.
53378,m149,ninotchka,L419621,u2320,SWANA,Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
53379,m149,ninotchka,L419620,u2312,LEON,Yes Swana.
53380,m149,ninotchka,L419619,u2320,SWANA,Is this your new dress suit?
53381,m149,ninotchka,L419618,u2312,LEON,Thank you.
53382,m149,ninotchka,L419362,u2320,SWANA,Now darling soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
53383,m149,ninotchka,L419361,u2312,LEON,Darling if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
53384,m149,ninotchka,L419360,u2320,SWANA,You saw all that in one glimpse?
53385,m149,ninotchka,L419359,u2312,LEON,Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
53386,m149,ninotchka,L419358,u2320,SWANA,That bad?  Old or young?
53387,m149,ninotchka,L419357,u2312,LEON,You can't imagine.
53388,m149,ninotchka,L419356,u2320,SWANA,Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
53389,m149,ninotchka,L419355,u2312,LEON,Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
53390,m149,ninotchka,L419354,u2320,SWANA,You just told me you hadn't seen her.
53391,m149,ninotchka,L419353,u2312,LEON,That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
53392,m149,ninotchka,L419352,u2320,SWANA,That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
53393,m149,ninotchka,L419351,u2312,LEON,No and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
53394,m149,ninotchka,L419350,u2320,SWANA,You haven't seen her yet?
53395,m149,ninotchka,L419349,u2312,LEON,Oh please Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
53396,m149,ninotchka,L419348,u2320,SWANA,Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter plenty of pepper and salt... Darling I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
53397,m149,ninotchka,L419344,u2320,SWANA,Not in your condition.  Make it tepid Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
53398,m149,ninotchka,L419343,u2312,LEON,Make it ice cold.
53399,m149,ninotchka,L419337,u2320,SWANA,Darling you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.
53400,m149,ninotchka,L419336,u2312,LEON,I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
53401,m149,ninotchka,L419335,u2320,SWANA,Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
53402,m149,ninotchka,L419334,u2312,LEON,No.
53403,m149,ninotchka,L419333,u2320,SWANA,Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
53404,m149,ninotchka,L419332,u2312,LEON,Huh?
53405,m149,ninotchka,L419331,u2320,SWANA,Leon! What in heaven's name...!
53406,m149,ninotchka,L418974,u2312,LEON,Darling calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman?
53407,m149,ninotchka,L418973,u2320,SWANA,It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money money money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
53408,m149,ninotchka,L418972,u2312,LEON,What did he say?
53409,m149,ninotchka,L418971,u2320,SWANA,Shhh!  ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right I'll let you know!
53410,m149,ninotchka,L418970,u2312,LEON,What does he say?
53411,m149,ninotchka,L418969,u2320,SWANA,This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well then get an injunction!... But do something Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
53412,m149,ninotchka,L418965,u2320,SWANA,Rakonin bless him has given me the most amazing news!
53413,m149,ninotchka,L418964,u2312,LEON,Did I hear something about jewels?
53414,m149,ninotchka,L418951,u2320,SWANA,Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
53415,m149,ninotchka,L418950,u2312,LEON,Oh yes.
53416,m149,ninotchka,L418949,u2320,SWANA,He's a waiter at the Clarence poor devil. You know him.
53417,m149,ninotchka,L418945,u2312,LEON,Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
53418,m149,ninotchka,L418944,u2320,SWANA,Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
53419,m149,ninotchka,L418943,u2312,LEON,Darling this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
53420,m149,ninotchka,L418942,u2320,SWANA,A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
53421,m149,ninotchka,L418939,u2312,LEON,Yes I'm your little Volga boatman.
53422,m149,ninotchka,L418938,u2320,SWANA,First tell me are you my little Volga boatman?
53423,m149,ninotchka,L418937,u2312,LEON,Now Swana...
53424,m149,ninotchka,L418936,u2320,SWANA,My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
53425,m149,ninotchka,L418934,u2320,SWANA,Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!
53426,m149,ninotchka,L418933,u2312,LEON,I understand how you feel but there is a limit to everything particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
53427,m149,ninotchka,L418932,u2320,SWANA,Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
53428,m149,ninotchka,L418931,u2312,LEON,Sweetheart we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
53429,m149,ninotchka,L418930,u2320,SWANA,Oh Leon!
53430,m149,ninotchka,L418928,u2320,SWANA,What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
53431,m149,ninotchka,L418927,u2312,LEON,You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
53432,m149,ninotchka,L418926,u2320,SWANA,Those newspaper people?
53433,m149,ninotchka,L418925,u2312,LEON,We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
53434,m149,ninotchka,L418924,u2320,SWANA,Oh Leon you are so good to me. 
53435,m149,ninotchka,L418923,u2312,LEON,We can forget horse racing roulette the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
53436,m149,ninotchka,L418922,u2320,SWANA,Did you win?
53437,m149,ninotchka,L418921,u2312,LEON,Darling I was busy looking out for your interests.
53438,m149,ninotchka,L418920,u2320,SWANA,Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
53439,m149,ninotchka,L418919,u2312,LEON,Your conversation has one marvelous advantage Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
53440,m149,ninotchka,L418918,u2320,SWANA,It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh well I guess one gets the face one deserves.
53441,m149,ninotchka,L418917,u2312,LEON,Good morning Swana.
53442,m149,ninotchka,L418916,u2320,SWANA,Hello Leon!
53443,m149,ninotchka,L419804,u2320,SWANA,I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition Comrade Yakushova.
53444,m149,ninotchka,L419803,u2314,NINOTCHKA,That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
53445,m149,ninotchka,L419802,u2320,SWANA,I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
53446,m149,ninotchka,L419801,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Go on.
53447,m149,ninotchka,L419800,u2320,SWANA,No I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
53448,m149,ninotchka,L419799,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
53449,m149,ninotchka,L419798,u2320,SWANA,I may run out of money but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
53450,m149,ninotchka,L419797,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people but now...
53451,m149,ninotchka,L419796,u2320,SWANA,My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court but I will drag you through every court don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am as always conservative.
53452,m149,ninotchka,L419795,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
53453,m149,ninotchka,L419794,u2320,SWANA,Unfortunately.
53454,m149,ninotchka,L419793,u2314,NINOTCHKA,In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
53455,m149,ninotchka,L419792,u2320,SWANA,Now let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
53456,m149,ninotchka,L419791,u2320,SWANA,I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
53457,m149,ninotchka,L419790,u2314,NINOTCHKA,They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat their blood their lives and you will give them back!
53458,m149,ninotchka,L419789,u2320,SWANA,That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother in fact they're mine you cannot steal what belongs to you!
53459,m149,ninotchka,L419788,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I will have to face the consequences but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
53460,m149,ninotchka,L419787,u2320,SWANA,Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
53461,m149,ninotchka,L419786,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You leave me no choice.
53462,m149,ninotchka,L419785,u2320,SWANA,Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
53463,m149,ninotchka,L419784,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Where are they?
53464,m149,ninotchka,L419783,u2320,SWANA,You were very careless with our precious jewels my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
53465,m149,ninotchka,L419782,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Where are they?
53466,m149,ninotchka,L419781,u2320,SWANA,Believe me Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.
53467,m149,ninotchka,L419780,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I told you to go madame.
53468,m149,ninotchka,L419779,u2320,SWANA,I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
53469,m149,ninotchka,L419777,u2314,NINOTCHKA,In that case I can only say good-by.
53470,m149,ninotchka,L419776,u2320,SWANA,Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
53471,m149,ninotchka,L419775,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I must insist that you leave.
53472,m149,ninotchka,L419774,u2320,SWANA,You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
53473,m149,ninotchka,L419773,u2320,SWANA,My dear you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
53474,m149,ninotchka,L419772,u2314,NINOTCHKA,It is not enough to be witty madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
53475,m149,ninotchka,L419771,u2320,SWANA,Very interesting my dear but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
53476,m149,ninotchka,L419770,u2314,NINOTCHKA,People cannot be taken away madame neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer and that's why you came here this morning.
53477,m149,ninotchka,L419769,u2320,SWANA,My palace in Petrograd... yes you took that away from me. You took away my czar my country my people everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
53478,m149,ninotchka,L419768,u2314,NINOTCHKA,If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
53479,m149,ninotchka,L419767,u2320,SWANA,Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
53480,m149,ninotchka,L419766,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Madame if you...
53481,m149,ninotchka,L419765,u2320,SWANA,Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
53482,m149,ninotchka,L419764,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I must ask you to leave.
53483,m149,ninotchka,L419763,u2320,SWANA,That's all right... I grow on people.
53484,m149,ninotchka,L419761,u2320,SWANA,Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
53485,m149,ninotchka,L419760,u2314,NINOTCHKA,We have nothing to discuss.
53486,m149,ninotchka,L419759,u2320,SWANA,I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
53487,m149,ninotchka,L419758,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Please come to the point. What is it you want?
53488,m149,ninotchka,L419757,u2320,SWANA,Don't worry you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties at least.
53489,m149,ninotchka,L419756,u2314,NINOTCHKA,If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
53490,m149,ninotchka,L419755,u2320,SWANA,How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
53491,m149,ninotchka,L419754,u2320,SWANA,Of course not my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
53492,m149,ninotchka,L419753,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
53493,m149,ninotchka,L419751,u2320,SWANA,It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon to be exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. Don't you recognize me? I am the Duchess Swana.
53494,m149,ninotchka,L419750,u2314,NINOTCHKA,What?
53495,m149,ninotchka,L419749,u2320,SWANA,Good morning.
53496,m149,ninotchka,L419651,u2320,SWANA,It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night Leon.
53497,m149,ninotchka,L419650,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You're right madame it will all be over by Thursday.
53498,m149,ninotchka,L419647,u2320,SWANA,You're absolutely right about the Cossacks. We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They had such reliable guns.
53499,m149,ninotchka,L419646,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Exactly. You see it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming and you know how vain women are.
53500,m149,ninotchka,L419645,u2320,SWANA,Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
53501,m149,ninotchka,L419641,u2320,SWANA,Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
53502,m149,ninotchka,L419640,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Not at all.... I understand perfectly Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear madame.
53504,m149,ninotchka,L419115,u2314,NINOTCHKA,That's no business... that's a social injustice.
53506,m149,ninotchka,L419111,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Why?
53508,m149,ninotchka,L419109,u2314,NINOTCHKA,What do you want?
53510,m149,ninotchka,L420054,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I will do my best.
53512,m149,ninotchka,L420052,u2314,NINOTCHKA,How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
53514,m149,ninotchka,L420050,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I am sorry I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
53516,m149,ninotchka,L420048,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I appreciate the confidence you show in me but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
53518,m149,ninotchka,L420046,u2314,NINOTCHKA,You want me to go to Constantinople?
53520,m149,ninotchka,L420044,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Oh they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
53521,m149,ninotchka,L420042,u2314,NINOTCHKA,May I ask what has happened?
53523,m149,ninotchka,L420040,u2314,NINOTCHKA,No.
53525,m149,ninotchka,L420038,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Thank you.
53528,m149,ninotchka,L420035,u2314,NINOTCHKA,May I ask why?
53530,m149,ninotchka,L420033,u2314,NINOTCHKA,I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
53532,m149,ninotchka,L420031,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Yes.
53534,m149,ninotchka,L420029,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Yes it does.
53536,m149,ninotchka,L420027,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Good morning Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
53539,m149,ninotchka,L419437,u2314,NINOTCHKA,The future of the common people.
53541,m149,ninotchka,L419435,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
53543,m149,ninotchka,L419428,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Raw carrots and beets.
53545,m149,ninotchka,L419426,u2314,NINOTCHKA,This will do. 
53548,m149,ninotchka,L419422,u2314,NINOTCHKA,Where is it?

53563,m149,ninotchka,L418958,u2320,SWANA,My jewels?!
53565,m149,ninotchka,L418956,u2320,SWANA,What is it Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
53567,m149,ninotchka,L418954,u2320,SWANA,How do you do my friend.
54901,m152,nurse betty,L424468,u2369,BETTY,Sheriff I don't...
54902,m152,nurse betty,L423718,u2369,BETTY,I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
54904,m152,nurse betty,L423716,u2369,BETTY,IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
54906,m152,nurse betty,L423714,u2369,BETTY,I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
54908,m152,nurse betty,L423343,u2369,BETTY,...I meant your food.
54910,m152,nurse betty,L423341,u2369,BETTY,Hey Sheriff. How's everything?
54925,m152,nurse betty,L423412,u2369,BETTY,'Kay good. Bye then...
54927,m152,nurse betty,L423410,u2369,BETTY,Hmm.  So Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
54929,m152,nurse betty,L423408,u2369,BETTY,They're fine... you miss it?
54931,m152,nurse betty,L423406,u2369,BETTY,Oh. How come?
54933,m152,nurse betty,L423404,u2369,BETTY,No I was just... How you doing?
54936,m152,nurse betty,L424570,u2369,BETTY,I don't think I am.
54937,m152,nurse betty,L424569,u2371,CHARLIE,Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me but I insisted...  I have to ask you Betty...are you crazy?
54938,m152,nurse betty,L424568,u2369,BETTY,I wouldn't have put it quite that way but...
54939,m152,nurse betty,L424567,u2371,CHARLIE,So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
54940,m152,nurse betty,L424566,u2369,BETTY,Yes... Not the actor though the doctor. I think.
54941,m152,nurse betty,L424565,u2371,CHARLIE,Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
54942,m152,nurse betty,L424564,u2371,CHARLIE,When a Roman general knew a battle was lost he'd throw himself on his sword.
54943,m152,nurse betty,L424563,u2369,BETTY,...what're you saying?
54944,m152,nurse betty,L424562,u2371,CHARLIE,Betty I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
54945,m152,nurse betty,L424561,u2369,BETTY,I'd rather not...
54946,m152,nurse betty,L424560,u2371,CHARLIE,Ahh it's too late anyway. It's too late.  Listen I could shoot my way out maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
54947,m152,nurse betty,L424559,u2369,BETTY,This is really awkward...
54948,m152,nurse betty,L424558,u2371,CHARLIE,Wait Betty... you still haven't answered me.
54949,m152,nurse betty,L424557,u2369,BETTY,I better go check on them.
54950,m152,nurse betty,L424556,u2371,CHARLIE,If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
54951,m152,nurse betty,L424544,u2369,BETTY,WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
54952,m152,nurse betty,L424543,u2371,CHARLIE,You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
54953,m152,nurse betty,L424542,u2369,BETTY,I'm sorry.
54954,m152,nurse betty,L424541,u2371,CHARLIE,That's my son! My son is dead!
54955,m152,nurse betty,L424528,u2371,CHARLIE,Yes but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
54956,m152,nurse betty,L424527,u2369,BETTY,I thought you were a garbageman of humanity or something.
54957,m152,nurse betty,L424526,u2371,CHARLIE,I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry they're fine...  Look I used to feel that same way said practically those same words sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country Betty and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
54958,m152,nurse betty,L424525,u2369,BETTY,I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
54959,m152,nurse betty,L424523,u2369,BETTY,I don't feel that no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
54960,m152,nurse betty,L424522,u2371,CHARLIE,Well thirty-three but I'm not counting Del on account of you... so what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
54961,m152,nurse betty,L424520,u2371,CHARLIE,Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony walks in the rain sunsets animals and children. I read passionately and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit excuse my language.
54962,m152,nurse betty,L424519,u2369,BETTY,Umm I don't think that...
54963,m152,nurse betty,L424518,u2371,CHARLIE,I'm appreciably older than you but my health is good. I take care of myself and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
54964,m152,nurse betty,L424517,u2371,CHARLIE,Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself and you don't even realize it.
54965,m152,nurse betty,L424516,u2369,BETTY,I am?
54966,m152,nurse betty,L424515,u2371,CHARLIE,...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash mostly people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
54967,m152,nurse betty,L424496,u2371,CHARLIE,...to see you.
54968,m152,nurse betty,L424495,u2369,BETTY,...well if you're not going to slit my throat why'd you come up here?
54969,m152,nurse betty,L424494,u2371,CHARLIE,Damn life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
54970,m152,nurse betty,L424493,u2369,BETTY,Drugs? God no! I'm totally against drugs.
54971,m152,nurse betty,L424492,u2371,CHARLIE,So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs Betty?
54972,m152,nurse betty,L424491,u2369,BETTY,I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
54973,m152,nurse betty,L424490,u2371,CHARLIE,You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing did you?
54974,m152,nurse betty,L424489,u2369,BETTY,I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me so kill me. You want me to be afraid but I'm not. I don't care who you are or why you two killed my husband...
54975,m152,nurse betty,L424488,u2371,CHARLIE,Do you know why I'm here?
54976,m152,nurse betty,L424487,u2369,BETTY,...I... I know what you are.
54977,m152,nurse betty,L424486,u2371,CHARLIE,Do you know who I am?
54978,m152,nurse betty,L424485,u2371,CHARLIE,No just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
54979,m152,nurse betty,L424484,u2369,BETTY,...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
54980,m152,nurse betty,L424477,u2371,CHARLIE,Oh this is wonderful...
54981,m152,nurse betty,L424476,u2369,BETTY,This is Roy Ostrey he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
54982,m152,nurse betty,L424475,u2371,CHARLIE,Who are these idiots?
54984,m152,nurse betty,L423944,u2369,BETTY,Umm... yes. Back home.
54987,m152,nurse betty,L423941,u2369,BETTY,Yes ma'am.
54990,m152,nurse betty,L423897,u2369,BETTY,It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun has palm trees out front mountains in the background...
54992,m152,nurse betty,L423895,u2369,BETTY,Of course he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
54994,m152,nurse betty,L423893,u2369,BETTY,Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome gentle considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now but --  It's not true. He was set up.
54997,m152,nurse betty,L423793,u2369,BETTY,I gotta go.
54999,m152,nurse betty,L423791,u2369,BETTY,Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick but I need to do this.
55000,m152,nurse betty,L423790,u2369,BETTY,What are you talking about?
55002,m152,nurse betty,L423788,u2369,BETTY,Sue Ann I thought you of all people would back me up on this you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
55004,m152,nurse betty,L423669,u2369,BETTY,Sue Ann I'm sorry about all this but I just know there's something special out there for me...
55006,m152,nurse betty,L423667,u2369,BETTY,Something bad happened to Del and me didn't it?
55008,m152,nurse betty,L423665,u2369,BETTY,All the time...
55010,m152,nurse betty,L423663,u2369,BETTY,Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good even if it's only a little bit.
55012,m152,nurse betty,L423661,u2369,BETTY,Are you and Larry happy?
55014,m152,nurse betty,L423437,u2369,BETTY,I gotta go make dinner.
55016,m152,nurse betty,L423435,u2369,BETTY,Yeah me too.
55018,m152,nurse betty,L423433,u2369,BETTY,He wasn't going to let us use it so I just took it.
55020,m152,nurse betty,L423431,u2369,BETTY,Maroon.  I stole it.
55022,m152,nurse betty,L423429,u2369,BETTY,What?
55024,m152,nurse betty,L423427,u2369,BETTY,Uh-huh. No we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday right? I'll have another one next year...
55026,m152,nurse betty,L423425,u2369,BETTY,It's all right.
55028,m152,nurse betty,L423423,u2369,BETTY,No... what about your sister?
55030,m152,nurse betty,L423421,u2369,BETTY,I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
55032,m152,nurse betty,L423419,u2369,BETTY,Yep. Hey I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
55034,m152,nurse betty,L423417,u2369,BETTY,Did you watch it yet?
55035,m152,nurse betty,L424594,u2369,BETTY,...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
55036,m152,nurse betty,L424593,u2379,GEORGE,Thanks...
55037,m152,nurse betty,L424592,u2369,BETTY,...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
55038,m152,nurse betty,L424591,u2379,GEORGE,George...
55039,m152,nurse betty,L424590,u2369,BETTY,Mmm-hmm. Listen I forgive you Mr. McCord...
55040,m152,nurse betty,L424589,u2379,GEORGE,I have... did it sound that bad?
55041,m152,nurse betty,L424588,u2369,BETTY,Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
55042,m152,nurse betty,L424587,u2379,GEORGE,Right... I was. I was an idiot plain and simple and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
55043,m152,nurse betty,L424586,u2369,BETTY,My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
55044,m152,nurse betty,L424585,u2379,GEORGE,Oh. Of course... sorry.
55045,m152,nurse betty,L424392,u2369,BETTY,No I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
55046,m152,nurse betty,L424391,u2379,GEORGE,You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
55047,m152,nurse betty,L424390,u2369,BETTY,Why are you screaming at me? I mean what am I... why am I here? I don't...
55048,m152,nurse betty,L424389,u2379,GEORGE,But I'm David... I mean I'm not David but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy she is!
55049,m152,nurse betty,L424386,u2379,GEORGE,...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
55050,m152,nurse betty,L424385,u2369,BETTY,I'm sorry... Oh my gosh are you George McCord?!
55051,m152,nurse betty,L424382,u2379,GEORGE,STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
55052,m152,nurse betty,L424381,u2369,BETTY,David please --
55053,m152,nurse betty,L424380,u2379,GEORGE,Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
55054,m152,nurse betty,L424379,u2369,BETTY,What do you mean? What did I do to you...
55055,m152,nurse betty,L424378,u2379,GEORGE,Well I don't know what you had in mind but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you my reputation and you're making me look like an idiot.
55056,m152,nurse betty,L424369,u2379,GEORGE,Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
55057,m152,nurse betty,L424368,u2369,BETTY,Why are you doing this to me?
55058,m152,nurse betty,L424367,u2379,GEORGE,Stop calling me David. We're on set for Christ's sake you don't have to call me David here.
55059,m152,nurse betty,L424366,u2369,BETTY,David I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
55060,m152,nurse betty,L424355,u2379,GEORGE,In fact I want you to ad lib that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
55061,m152,nurse betty,L424354,u2369,BETTY,Ad lib?
55062,m152,nurse betty,L424353,u2379,GEORGE,Your lines are in the script but you can ad lib.
55063,m152,nurse betty,L424325,u2379,GEORGE,Yes... maybe it was.
55064,m152,nurse betty,L424324,u2369,BETTY,I remember. You said it to her but it was meant for me wasn't it?
55065,m152,nurse betty,L424323,u2379,GEORGE,You know I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie once at her funeral remember?...
55066,m152,nurse betty,L424322,u2369,BETTY,Well I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
55067,m152,nurse betty,L424321,u2379,GEORGE,Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
55068,m152,nurse betty,L424320,u2369,BETTY,...but I love listening to you so that's okay...
55069,m152,nurse betty,L424318,u2369,BETTY,It's easy to be dedicated when you care about something...
55070,m152,nurse betty,L424317,u2379,GEORGE,No I mean your dedication scares me...
55071,m152,nurse betty,L424316,u2369,BETTY,I know that's why we were meant to be together...
55072,m152,nurse betty,L424315,u2379,GEORGE,I've never met anyone like you Betty.
55073,m152,nurse betty,L424314,u2369,BETTY,No I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
55074,m152,nurse betty,L424313,u2379,GEORGE,Didn't I?
55075,m152,nurse betty,L424312,u2369,BETTY,You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
55076,m152,nurse betty,L424310,u2379,GEORGE,Well first I thought Patina and then the Ivy but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
55077,m152,nurse betty,L424309,u2369,BETTY,She's a little jealous I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
55078,m152,nurse betty,L424308,u2379,GEORGE,I don't think your friend likes me.
55079,m152,nurse betty,L424223,u2369,BETTY,I know. It's up to us.
55080,m152,nurse betty,L424222,u2379,GEORGE,At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined but... it's not up to me.
55081,m152,nurse betty,L424221,u2369,BETTY,Of course.
55082,m152,nurse betty,L424220,u2379,GEORGE,I know. Listen we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
55083,m152,nurse betty,L424219,u2369,BETTY,I just want everything to be perfect between us.
55084,m152,nurse betty,L424218,u2379,GEORGE,Wow... You just gave me goosebumps you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
55085,m152,nurse betty,L424300,u2386,ROSA,Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients the hospital?
55086,m152,nurse betty,L424299,u2369,BETTY,You should have a little faith in people.
55087,m152,nurse betty,L424298,u2386,ROSA,Well what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
55088,m152,nurse betty,L424297,u2369,BETTY,Rosa...
55089,m152,nurse betty,L424296,u2386,ROSA,No please. Go ahead it's your funeral...
55090,m152,nurse betty,L424295,u2369,BETTY,Are you sure I can borrow this?
55091,m152,nurse betty,L424239,u2386,ROSA,But you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here you meet this guy who should laugh in your face and instead you leave with him!  Betty you are one-of-a-kind...
55092,m152,nurse betty,L424238,u2369,BETTY,No almost never.
55093,m152,nurse betty,L424237,u2386,ROSA,This isn't fair you know. Do you always get what you want?
55094,m152,nurse betty,L424236,u2386,ROSA,I have lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
55095,m152,nurse betty,L424235,u2369,BETTY,Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
55096,m152,nurse betty,L424234,u2386,ROSA,Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
55097,m152,nurse betty,L424233,u2369,BETTY,To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
55098,m152,nurse betty,L424232,u2386,ROSA,No I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So where'd you go?
55099,m152,nurse betty,L424231,u2369,BETTY,Oh my gosh everything! My trip out here what we've both been doing you know...
55100,m152,nurse betty,L424230,u2386,ROSA,Uh-huh... So what'd you talk about?
55101,m152,nurse betty,L424229,u2369,BETTY,He is real.
55102,m152,nurse betty,L424228,u2386,ROSA,Does he know you think he's real?
55103,m152,nurse betty,L424227,u2386,ROSA,You still in love?
55104,m152,nurse betty,L424226,u2369,BETTY,Oh God! You scared me! Yes...
55105,m152,nurse betty,L424225,u2386,ROSA,Were you with him this whole time?
55106,m152,nurse betty,L424118,u2386,ROSA,You never know who you'll see.
55107,m152,nurse betty,L424117,u2369,BETTY,Looking for someone?
55108,m152,nurse betty,L424101,u2369,BETTY,Umm...
55109,m152,nurse betty,L424100,u2386,ROSA,Oh it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause but I don't have anybody to go with...
55110,m152,nurse betty,L424099,u2369,BETTY,What are those for?
55111,m152,nurse betty,L424098,u2369,BETTY,...okay.
55112,m152,nurse betty,L424097,u2386,ROSA,So what do you say? Can we be friends?
55113,m152,nurse betty,L424096,u2386,ROSA,This is crazy. I come home you go to your room. You go in the kitchen I go to my room. It's stupid.
55114,m152,nurse betty,L424095,u2369,BETTY,Don't worry I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
55115,m152,nurse betty,L424070,u2369,BETTY,Fine.
55116,m152,nurse betty,L424069,u2386,ROSA,I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
55117,m152,nurse betty,L424067,u2369,BETTY,HE IS REAL!!
55118,m152,nurse betty,L424066,u2386,ROSA,I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
55119,m152,nurse betty,L424065,u2369,BETTY,Why'd you help me in the first place?
55120,m152,nurse betty,L424063,u2386,ROSA,IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George by the way. His character!
55121,m152,nurse betty,L424062,u2369,BETTY,If you didn't want to do it you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
55122,m152,nurse betty,L424061,u2386,ROSA,I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother but I was with you.
55123,m152,nurse betty,L424060,u2369,BETTY,Shhh! I heard you the first time.
55124,m152,nurse betty,L424059,u2386,ROSA,I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
55125,m152,nurse betty,L424058,u2369,BETTY,I have no idea what you're talking about.
55126,m152,nurse betty,L424057,u2386,ROSA,Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
55127,m152,nurse betty,L424056,u2386,ROSA,ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit will you!
55128,m152,nurse betty,L424055,u2369,BETTY,What? Where was he?!
55129,m152,nurse betty,L424054,u2386,ROSA,Doctor David Ravell.
55130,m152,nurse betty,L424053,u2369,BETTY,Who?
55131,m152,nurse betty,L424052,u2386,ROSA,Guess who I saw today.
55132,m152,nurse betty,L424022,u2386,ROSA,I was talking about what you could wear!
55133,m152,nurse betty,L424021,u2369,BETTY,You said in L.A. anything goes.
55134,m152,nurse betty,L424020,u2386,ROSA,Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
55135,m152,nurse betty,L424019,u2369,BETTY,How many men have I talked to?
55136,m152,nurse betty,L424017,u2369,BETTY,Rosa I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
55137,m152,nurse betty,L424016,u2386,ROSA,Fuck the details they're always to blame... Look too many of these guys duck out on us especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your you know fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
55138,m152,nurse betty,L424015,u2369,BETTY,David isn't hiding from me I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
55139,m152,nurse betty,L424014,u2386,ROSA,...so we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
55140,m152,nurse betty,L424013,u2386,ROSA,Jesus I thought my love life was crazy...
55141,m152,nurse betty,L424012,u2369,BETTY,No no! Well see she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
55142,m152,nurse betty,L424011,u2386,ROSA,Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
55143,m152,nurse betty,L424010,u2369,BETTY,It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
55144,m152,nurse betty,L424009,u2386,ROSA,God that's awful!
55145,m152,nurse betty,L424008,u2369,BETTY,Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
55146,m152,nurse betty,L424007,u2386,ROSA,He has a wife?!
55147,m152,nurse betty,L424006,u2369,BETTY,I know what you mean I recently had some trouble with a man a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
55148,m152,nurse betty,L424005,u2386,ROSA,What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily I'm currently off men so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
55149,m152,nurse betty,L424004,u2369,BETTY,You know the more I think about it this really isn't David's kind of place.
55150,m152,nurse betty,L424003,u2369,BETTY,Ummm... no no. Different 'Ravell.'
55151,m152,nurse betty,L424002,u2386,ROSA,You made it! Hey that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So how'd it go today? You find him?
55152,m152,nurse betty,L424001,u2386,ROSA,Huh? Sure look in my closet take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight right?
55153,m152,nurse betty,L424000,u2369,BETTY,Okay... oh umm would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
55154,m152,nurse betty,L423999,u2386,ROSA,Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
55155,m152,nurse betty,L423998,u2369,BETTY,The Five?
55156,m152,nurse betty,L423997,u2386,ROSA,Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
55157,m152,nurse betty,L423996,u2369,BETTY,Hey Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
55158,m152,nurse betty,L423975,u2386,ROSA,Oh I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
55159,m152,nurse betty,L423974,u2369,BETTY,Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
55160,m152,nurse betty,L423973,u2386,ROSA,Yeah well at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
55161,m152,nurse betty,L423972,u2369,BETTY,It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
55162,m152,nurse betty,L423971,u2386,ROSA,No this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there which I'm trusting you with 'cause if it gets out I'm on the street...
55163,m152,nurse betty,L423970,u2369,BETTY,The one you were telling me about?
55164,m152,nurse betty,L423969,u2386,ROSA,I got this apartment with a guy.
55165,m152,nurse betty,L423967,u2386,ROSA,Listen when someone does the kind of thing you did you gotta do something in return. So you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
55166,m152,nurse betty,L423966,u2369,BETTY,No that's not I couldn't...
55167,m152,nurse betty,L423965,u2386,ROSA,You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
55168,m152,nurse betty,L423962,u2386,ROSA,Man that is love.
55169,m152,nurse betty,L423961,u2369,BETTY,No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
55170,m152,nurse betty,L423960,u2386,ROSA,'David.' That's your guy. So you staying with him?
55171,m152,nurse betty,L423959,u2369,BETTY,It's something I had to do. For David.
55172,m152,nurse betty,L423956,u2369,BETTY,I came for love. My fiancé is here.
55173,m152,nurse betty,L423955,u2386,ROSA,So why'd you come to L.A.?
55174,m152,nurse betty,L423954,u2369,BETTY,I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
55175,m152,nurse betty,L423953,u2386,ROSA,You don't sound like you're from here.
55176,m152,nurse betty,L423917,u2369,BETTY,LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS HE'S DEAD!
55177,m152,nurse betty,L423916,u2386,ROSA,ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
55178,m152,nurse betty,L423915,u2369,BETTY,I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
55179,m152,nurse betty,L423914,u2386,ROSA,You're hurting him!!
55180,m152,nurse betty,L423913,u2369,BETTY,He has no heartbeat!
55181,m152,nurse betty,L423912,u2386,ROSA,What are you doing?
55188,m152,nurse betty,L424401,u2379,GEORGE,Good.
55189,m152,nurse betty,L424400,u2371,CHARLIE,No that should be more than --
55190,m152,nurse betty,L424399,u2379,GEORGE,More than you know. Is there anything else?
55191,m152,nurse betty,L424398,u2371,CHARLIE,Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
55192,m152,nurse betty,L424397,u2379,GEORGE,That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
55193,m152,nurse betty,L424396,u2379,GEORGE,Deranged. That would be the right word.
55194,m152,nurse betty,L424395,u2371,CHARLIE,How do you do Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours... a Ms. Betty...
55195,m152,nurse betty,L424394,u2379,GEORGE,What can I do for you gentlemen?
55196,m152,nurse betty,L423689,u2371,CHARLIE,Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
55198,m152,nurse betty,L423687,u2371,CHARLIE,Did you know the most brutal inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
55200,m152,nurse betty,L423685,u2371,CHARLIE,Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
55202,m152,nurse betty,L423683,u2371,CHARLIE,Jeb Stuart Stonewall Jackson Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
55204,m152,nurse betty,L423681,u2371,CHARLIE,You know it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War but they still seem to get all the glory.
55207,m152,nurse betty,L423676,u2371,CHARLIE,What part of Dixie are you from Duane?
55208,m152,nurse betty,L423534,u2371,CHARLIE,...and put them in your mouth.
55211,m152,nurse betty,L423529,u2371,CHARLIE,Well my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off please?
55213,m152,nurse betty,L423527,u2371,CHARLIE,Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa Kickapoo or Osage if I'm not mistaken.
55215,m152,nurse betty,L423525,u2371,CHARLIE,Like what?
55217,m152,nurse betty,L424280,u2371,CHARLIE,Wesley...
55218,m152,nurse betty,L424279,u2389,WESLEY,I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
55219,m152,nurse betty,L424278,u2371,CHARLIE,You need to remember who you're talking to...
55220,m152,nurse betty,L424277,u2389,WESLEY,I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
55221,m152,nurse betty,L424276,u2371,CHARLIE,'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
55222,m152,nurse betty,L424275,u2389,WESLEY,No you believed her we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
55223,m152,nurse betty,L424274,u2371,CHARLIE,I never said that I believed...
55224,m152,nurse betty,L424273,u2389,WESLEY,You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory you believe that dumbshit trucker you believe this woman...
55225,m152,nurse betty,L424272,u2371,CHARLIE,What doesn't?
55226,m152,nurse betty,L424271,u2389,WESLEY,Wait wait wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
55227,m152,nurse betty,L424270,u2371,CHARLIE,No no Betty came here strictly for business 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So first thing we...
55228,m152,nurse betty,L424269,u2389,WESLEY,I dunno that lady sounded pretty sure...
55229,m152,nurse betty,L424268,u2371,CHARLIE,That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
55230,m152,nurse betty,L424267,u2389,WESLEY,Well... I think I saw her soul.
55231,m152,nurse betty,L424266,u2371,CHARLIE,So you believed the bartender. Why?
55232,m152,nurse betty,L424192,u2389,WESLEY,Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees doesn't she?!...
55233,m152,nurse betty,L424191,u2371,CHARLIE,This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
55234,m152,nurse betty,L424175,u2389,WESLEY,I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
55235,m152,nurse betty,L424174,u2371,CHARLIE,What?
55236,m152,nurse betty,L424173,u2389,WESLEY,I'm not telling.
55237,m152,nurse betty,L424172,u2371,CHARLIE,Where? Where is she?
55238,m152,nurse betty,L424171,u2389,WESLEY,Well guess what? I found Betty... where she's been anyway.
55239,m152,nurse betty,L424114,u2389,WESLEY,Yes I am and we're not going. Act professional.
55240,m152,nurse betty,L424113,u2371,CHARLIE,Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
55241,m152,nurse betty,L424112,u2389,WESLEY,Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
55242,m152,nurse betty,L424110,u2389,WESLEY,I said 'No.' N-O.
55243,m152,nurse betty,L424109,u2371,CHARLIE,What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City or Houston or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
55244,m152,nurse betty,L424108,u2389,WESLEY,No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
55245,m152,nurse betty,L424107,u2371,CHARLIE,One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
55246,m152,nurse betty,L424106,u2389,WESLEY,No.
55247,m152,nurse betty,L424105,u2371,CHARLIE,It's a very moving experience trust me.
55248,m152,nurse betty,L424104,u2389,WESLEY,We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
55249,m152,nurse betty,L424103,u2371,CHARLIE,We should go.
55250,m152,nurse betty,L424038,u2371,CHARLIE,Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde thin' yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?
55251,m152,nurse betty,L424037,u2389,WESLEY,You know blonde thin whatever...
55252,m152,nurse betty,L424036,u2371,CHARLIE,How'd they describe her?
55253,m152,nurse betty,L424031,u2389,WESLEY,I don't know but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
55254,m152,nurse betty,L424030,u2371,CHARLIE,I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
55255,m152,nurse betty,L424029,u2389,WESLEY,What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
55256,m152,nurse betty,L424027,u2389,WESLEY,I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
55257,m152,nurse betty,L424026,u2371,CHARLIE,That was a really shitty thing to do.
55258,m152,nurse betty,L424025,u2389,WESLEY,What the hell's the matter with you?
55259,m152,nurse betty,L424024,u2371,CHARLIE,You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention do you? Nah. You're like me.
55260,m152,nurse betty,L423989,u2371,CHARLIE,Well I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
55261,m152,nurse betty,L423988,u2389,WESLEY,Worse... you're in Texas.
55262,m152,nurse betty,L423987,u2371,CHARLIE,Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
55263,m152,nurse betty,L423986,u2371,CHARLIE,AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
55264,m152,nurse betty,L423985,u2389,WESLEY,I know that.
55265,m152,nurse betty,L423984,u2371,CHARLIE,That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
55266,m152,nurse betty,L423926,u2389,WESLEY,And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
55267,m152,nurse betty,L423925,u2371,CHARLIE,It's not an exact science Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
55268,m152,nurse betty,L423924,u2389,WESLEY,Thas' it thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
55269,m152,nurse betty,L423880,u2389,WESLEY,Well then did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
55270,m152,nurse betty,L423879,u2371,CHARLIE,Wise beyond her years I'm sure and such poise too.  Very very impressive...
55271,m152,nurse betty,L423852,u2371,CHARLIE,No... like a worthy adversary Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
55272,m152,nurse betty,L423851,u2389,WESLEY,Like... us?
55273,m152,nurse betty,L423850,u2371,CHARLIE,Oh for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
55274,m152,nurse betty,L423849,u2389,WESLEY,So what the fuck's a Finn?
55275,m152,nurse betty,L423848,u2371,CHARLIE,Betty Betty Betty...
55276,m152,nurse betty,L423847,u2371,CHARLIE,You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for what three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
55277,m152,nurse betty,L423846,u2389,WESLEY,A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
55278,m152,nurse betty,L423845,u2371,CHARLIE,No I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
55279,m152,nurse betty,L423841,u2389,WESLEY,Yeah well if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur just like Del was.
55280,m152,nurse betty,L423840,u2371,CHARLIE,I'd say that about torches her credibility wouldn't you?
55281,m152,nurse betty,L423839,u2389,WESLEY,...among others.
55282,m152,nurse betty,L423838,u2371,CHARLIE,Joyce was screwing Del.
55283,m152,nurse betty,L423837,u2389,WESLEY,You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
55284,m152,nurse betty,L423836,u2371,CHARLIE,So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
55285,m152,nurse betty,L423737,u2389,WESLEY,...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here and get the fuck gone.
55286,m152,nurse betty,L423736,u2371,CHARLIE,I hope you're right...
55287,m152,nurse betty,L423735,u2389,WESLEY,I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
55288,m152,nurse betty,L423734,u2371,CHARLIE,Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
55289,m152,nurse betty,L423730,u2371,CHARLIE,We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift remember?
55290,m152,nurse betty,L423729,u2389,WESLEY,So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
55291,m152,nurse betty,L423709,u2371,CHARLIE,You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
55292,m152,nurse betty,L423708,u2389,WESLEY,Well no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
55293,m152,nurse betty,L423707,u2371,CHARLIE,What the hell was that another statement?
55294,m152,nurse betty,L423702,u2371,CHARLIE,Wait. Any last words General Lee?
55295,m152,nurse betty,L423701,u2389,WESLEY,Should I kill him now?
55296,m152,nurse betty,L423700,u2371,CHARLIE,He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
55297,m152,nurse betty,L423695,u2389,WESLEY,Actually I scalped him and then you killed him.
55298,m152,nurse betty,L423694,u2371,CHARLIE,Del's dead by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
55299,m152,nurse betty,L423679,u2371,CHARLIE,I'm a Yankee myself. Massachusetts.
55300,m152,nurse betty,L423678,u2389,WESLEY,We can live with that.
55301,m152,nurse betty,L423674,u2389,WESLEY,I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
55302,m152,nurse betty,L423673,u2371,CHARLIE,Mmmm. Well it was a piece of luck running into you Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
55303,m152,nurse betty,L423629,u2371,CHARLIE,Fine I'll get you a bumpersticker but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
55304,m152,nurse betty,L423628,u2389,WESLEY,...that's a good motto.
55305,m152,nurse betty,L423627,u2371,CHARLIE,Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy just good. They get in they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom boom boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
55306,m152,nurse betty,L423626,u2389,WESLEY,I wanted to make a statement.
55307,m152,nurse betty,L423625,u2371,CHARLIE,Why not it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something now that you fucked it up.
55308,m152,nurse betty,L423624,u2389,WESLEY,You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
55309,m152,nurse betty,L423623,u2371,CHARLIE,It's not here. Let's go.
55310,m152,nurse betty,L423622,u2371,CHARLIE,What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
55311,m152,nurse betty,L423621,u2389,WESLEY,Well why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
55312,m152,nurse betty,L423620,u2371,CHARLIE,I wasn't done I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out you scalped him. Christ I almost puked did I tell you that?
55313,m152,nurse betty,L423619,u2389,WESLEY,That one look you got! I thought you were done so I took him out...
55314,m152,nurse betty,L423618,u2371,CHARLIE,What 'look'?
55315,m152,nurse betty,L423617,u2389,WESLEY,I didn't. You gave me a look!
55316,m152,nurse betty,L423616,u2371,CHARLIE,I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
55317,m152,nurse betty,L423615,u2389,WESLEY,I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
55318,m152,nurse betty,L423570,u2371,CHARLIE,I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
55319,m152,nurse betty,L423569,u2389,WESLEY,Well why'd you shoot him?
55320,m152,nurse betty,L423568,u2371,CHARLIE,We don't know which Buick do we?
55321,m152,nurse betty,L423567,u2389,WESLEY,He told us it's in the Buick.
55322,m152,nurse betty,L423566,u2371,CHARLIE,This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
55323,m152,nurse betty,L423565,u2371,CHARLIE,That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing will you?
55324,m152,nurse betty,L423564,u2389,WESLEY,You told me how to do it!
55325,m152,nurse betty,L423563,u2371,CHARLIE,Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
55326,m152,nurse betty,L423560,u2389,WESLEY,IT SURE IS!!
55327,m152,nurse betty,L423559,u2371,CHARLIE,I'm all for them owning casinos getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony isn't it Wesley?
55328,m152,nurse betty,L423549,u2389,WESLEY,A mark huh?
55329,m152,nurse betty,L423548,u2371,CHARLIE,Hold still Del we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
55330,m152,nurse betty,L423546,u2371,CHARLIE,It wasn't always fatal Wesley. We could scalp Del right now and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
55331,m152,nurse betty,L423545,u2389,WESLEY,Hell of a way to die.
55332,m152,nurse betty,L423544,u2371,CHARLIE,You know a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
55333,m152,nurse betty,L423542,u2371,CHARLIE,So you see we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
55334,m152,nurse betty,L423541,u2389,WESLEY,Now that's really stupid.
55335,m152,nurse betty,L423540,u2371,CHARLIE,Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
55336,m152,nurse betty,L423539,u2389,WESLEY,That is so right.
55337,m152,nurse betty,L423538,u2371,CHARLIE,Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are by their very nature untrustworthy.
55338,m152,nurse betty,L423537,u2389,WESLEY,That's right.
55339,m152,nurse betty,L423517,u2371,CHARLIE,That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
55340,m152,nurse betty,L423516,u2389,WESLEY,No that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
55341,m152,nurse betty,L423513,u2371,CHARLIE,I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
55342,m152,nurse betty,L423512,u2389,WESLEY,Relax we brought the cash.
55343,m152,nurse betty,L423479,u2371,CHARLIE,Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
55344,m152,nurse betty,L423478,u2389,WESLEY,Hey... you got a fine one right here!
55345,m152,nurse betty,L423476,u2389,WESLEY,Beer please.
55346,m152,nurse betty,L423475,u2371,CHARLIE,Bourbon little water thank you.
55347,m152,nurse betty,L423884,u2371,CHARLIE,Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now without a doubt that your granddaughter is alive and did not kill Del Sizemore.
55349,m152,nurse betty,L423882,u2371,CHARLIE,What do you mean?
55352,m152,nurse betty,L423874,u2371,CHARLIE,Very graceful. Perfect form.
55355,m152,nurse betty,L423758,u2371,CHARLIE,Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
55357,m152,nurse betty,L423756,u2371,CHARLIE,I see.  May I?
55359,m152,nurse betty,L423754,u2371,CHARLIE,But she wanted more out of life right?
55361,m152,nurse betty,L423752,u2371,CHARLIE,Hmm... you two in high school together?
55363,m152,nurse betty,L423750,u2371,CHARLIE,...and how long did she work here?
55365,m152,nurse betty,L423520,u2389,WESLEY,He's waiting...
55368,m152,nurse betty,L423502,u2389,WESLEY,Really?
55370,m152,nurse betty,L423498,u2389,WESLEY,Seems like a nice place.
55372,m152,nurse betty,L423492,u2389,WESLEY,Isn't that the point?
55374,m152,nurse betty,L423485,u2389,WESLEY,What'd you get her?
55376,m152,nurse betty,L424579,u2379,GEORGE,Jesus don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me I'll never land a pilot.
55377,m152,nurse betty,L424578,u2379,GEORGE,That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
55379,m152,nurse betty,L424576,u2379,GEORGE,What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
55381,m152,nurse betty,L424574,u2379,GEORGE,I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
55384,m152,nurse betty,L424376,u2379,GEORGE,Let me try this goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
55385,m152,nurse betty,L424373,u2379,GEORGE,No! Let me try this!
55387,m152,nurse betty,L424371,u2379,GEORGE,No! No problem there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days now do it!
55389,m152,nurse betty,L424365,u2379,GEORGE,If you need a minute that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
55391,m152,nurse betty,L424363,u2379,GEORGE,Betty I thought this would be the best way. You know throw you into it...
55392,m152,nurse betty,L424265,u2379,GEORGE,...yeah.
55393,m152,nurse betty,L424263,u2379,GEORGE,Hmm?
55395,m152,nurse betty,L424261,u2379,GEORGE,Fine but promise me one thing. If we use her I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
55397,m152,nurse betty,L424259,u2379,GEORGE,It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
55399,m152,nurse betty,L424257,u2379,GEORGE,I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
55401,m152,nurse betty,L424255,u2379,GEORGE,Oh of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
55403,m152,nurse betty,L424253,u2379,GEORGE,Can I have an evil twin?
55405,m152,nurse betty,L424251,u2379,GEORGE,She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring Lyla.
55408,m152,nurse betty,L424161,u2379,GEORGE,Right uhh... I feel terrible about this we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
55409,m152,nurse betty,L424150,u2379,GEORGE,I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
55411,m152,nurse betty,L424135,u2379,GEORGE,No wait... what happened next Betty?
55414,m152,nurse betty,L424291,u2389,WESLEY,Hey can you sneak me on the lot?
55415,m152,nurse betty,L424290,u2389,WESLEY,Oh fuck...
55417,m152,nurse betty,L424288,u2389,WESLEY,Damn that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
55419,m152,nurse betty,L424286,u2389,WESLEY,Yeah? The sport utility?
55421,m152,nurse betty,L424284,u2389,WESLEY,...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
55422,m152,nurse betty,L423888,u2389,WESLEY,What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
55424,m152,nurse betty,L423886,u2389,WESLEY,...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
55427,m152,nurse betty,L423877,u2389,WESLEY,Would you say she was ambitious?
55443,m152,nurse betty,L424093,u2386,ROSA,Oh yeah... Man I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
55445,m152,nurse betty,L424050,u2386,ROSA,I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
55447,m152,nurse betty,L424048,u2386,ROSA,David Ravell.
55449,m152,nurse betty,L424046,u2386,ROSA,She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
55451,m152,nurse betty,L424044,u2386,ROSA,Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
55453,m152,nurse betty,L424042,u2386,ROSA,Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
55456,m152,nurse betty,L424511,u2389,WESLEY,You lie motherfucker...
55458,m152,nurse betty,L424509,u2389,WESLEY,Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
55460,m152,nurse betty,L424507,u2389,WESLEY,Did Chloe crack?
55462,m152,nurse betty,L424505,u2389,WESLEY,SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up both of you before I kill you!
55464,m152,nurse betty,L424168,u2389,WESLEY,Oh umm yes this is Dwight Campbell.
55466,m152,nurse betty,L424166,u2389,WESLEY,Huh?
55468,m152,nurse betty,L424164,u2389,WESLEY,Yeah?
55469,m152,nurse betty,L423749,u2389,WESLEY,Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape by any chance?
55471,m152,nurse betty,L423747,u2389,WESLEY,I see.  Did Chloe testify?
55472,m152,nurse betty,L423745,u2389,WESLEY,Her show?
55474,m152,nurse betty,L423743,u2389,WESLEY,I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
55476,m152,nurse betty,L423741,u2389,WESLEY,Aren't they precious?  Ma'am she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
55478,m152,nurse betty,L423739,u2389,WESLEY,Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
57574,m162,pleasantville,L447968,u2496,BETTY,Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.
57575,m162,pleasantville,L447967,u2506,JENNIFER,What?
57576,m162,pleasantville,L447966,u2496,BETTY,Yes ...  It's just that ...
57577,m162,pleasantville,L447963,u2506,JENNIFER,Okay.
57578,m162,pleasantville,L447962,u2496,BETTY,Yes.
57579,m162,pleasantville,L447961,u2506,JENNIFER,You sure you want to know this?
57580,m162,pleasantville,L447959,u2496,BETTY,Ah.
57581,m162,pleasantville,L447958,u2506,JENNIFER,... Sex.
57582,m162,pleasantville,L447957,u2496,BETTY,No. I want to know.
57583,m162,pleasantville,L447956,u2506,JENNIFER,It doesn't matter.
57584,m162,pleasantville,L447955,u2496,BETTY,What?
57585,m162,pleasantville,L447954,u2506,JENNIFER,Yeah ...  That--and ...
57586,m162,pleasantville,L447953,u2496,BETTY,Well you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
57587,m162,pleasantville,L447952,u2506,JENNIFER,What do you mean?
57588,m162,pleasantville,L447951,u2496,BETTY,What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
57589,m162,pleasantville,L447950,u2506,JENNIFER,Sure.
57590,m162,pleasantville,L447949,u2496,BETTY,Can I ask you a question?
57591,m162,pleasantville,L447948,u2506,JENNIFER,Yeah?
57592,m162,pleasantville,L447947,u2496,BETTY,Mary Sue?
57593,m162,pleasantville,L447659,u2496,BETTY,Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
57594,m162,pleasantville,L447658,u2506,JENNIFER,Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
57595,m162,pleasantville,L447657,u2496,BETTY,I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
57596,m162,pleasantville,L447652,u2506,JENNIFER,Thanks.
57597,m162,pleasantville,L447651,u2496,BETTY,I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
57598,m162,pleasantville,L448542,u2496,BETTY,I love you too.
57599,m162,pleasantville,L448541,u2502,DAVID,Thanks ... I love you.

57604,m162,pleasantville,L448536,u2496,BETTY,There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
57605,m162,pleasantville,L448535,u2496,BETTY,I had to say goodbye.

57625,m162,pleasantville,L447648,u2502,DAVID,It can't be possible.
57626,m162,pleasantville,L447647,u2496,BETTY,Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.

57682,m162,pleasantville,L447835,u2496,BETTY,Oh George ...
57684,m162,pleasantville,L447482,u2496,BETTY,Oh darling that's wonderful!  I always knew you could do it.
57686,m162,pleasantville,L447480,u2496,BETTY,How was your day?
57687,m162,pleasantville,L448386,u2506,JENNIFER,I said NO!  ... I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire ...
57689,m162,pleasantville,L448384,u2506,JENNIFER,Don't! Just let go.
57691,m162,pleasantville,L448210,u2506,JENNIFER,I'm busy.
57693,m162,pleasantville,L448208,u2506,JENNIFER,Oh.  I can't.
57695,m162,pleasantville,L448206,u2506,JENNIFER,So.
57697,m162,pleasantville,L448204,u2506,JENNIFER,What are you doing?
57699,m162,pleasantville,L447843,u2506,JENNIFER,Trust me ...
57701,m162,pleasantville,L447841,u2506,JENNIFER,It's s'posed to happen Biff.
57703,m162,pleasantville,L447838,u2506,JENNIFER,... Why?
57705,m162,pleasantville,L447824,u2506,JENNIFER,Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
57708,m162,pleasantville,L447816,u2506,JENNIFER,... Lover's Lane.
57710,m162,pleasantville,L447814,u2506,JENNIFER,You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
57712,m162,pleasantville,L447812,u2506,JENNIFER,You want to get out of here?
57714,m162,pleasantville,L447802,u2506,JENNIFER,Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
57716,m162,pleasantville,L447800,u2506,JENNIFER,Oh gosh no.
57719,m162,pleasantville,L447797,u2506,JENNIFER,Well sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
57720,m162,pleasantville,L447790,u2506,JENNIFER,Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
57722,m162,pleasantville,L447788,u2506,JENNIFER,Really Biff? The keenest?
57725,m162,pleasantville,L447689,u2506,JENNIFER,Um ... It's ...
57728,m162,pleasantville,L447899,u2502,DAVID,What'll it be?
57730,m162,pleasantville,L447727,u2502,DAVID,I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
57732,m162,pleasantville,L447724,u2502,DAVID,Lucky guess.  Look Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...
57734,m162,pleasantville,L447722,u2502,DAVID,You want to ask her out tonight right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
57736,m162,pleasantville,L447720,u2502,DAVID,I don't believe it.
57738,m162,pleasantville,L447718,u2502,DAVID,Oh God! Are we in that episode?
57740,m162,pleasantville,L448508,u2502,DAVID,But it could happen.
57742,m162,pleasantville,L448506,u2502,DAVID,C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
57743,m162,pleasantville,L448494,u2502,DAVID,Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
57755,m162,pleasantville,L448503,u2502,DAVID,Oh sure it is.
57757,m162,pleasantville,L448501,u2502,DAVID,But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
57759,m162,pleasantville,L448499,u2502,DAVID,Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
57761,m162,pleasantville,L448497,u2502,DAVID,Why am I out of order?
57763,m162,pleasantville,L448476,u2502,DAVID,I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
57765,m162,pleasantville,L448474,u2502,DAVID,I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
57767,m162,pleasantville,L448470,u2502,DAVID,Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
57769,m162,pleasantville,L448468,u2502,DAVID,It's like the basketball team.
57771,m162,pleasantville,L448464,u2502,DAVID,I think I've got something to say.
57773,m162,pleasantville,L448460,u2502,DAVID,It was accessible to everyone.
57775,m162,pleasantville,L448458,u2502,DAVID,Well--it was dark out ...
57777,m162,pleasantville,L448455,u2502,DAVID,Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
57779,m162,pleasantville,L448423,u2502,DAVID,Still doesn't make it right.
57781,m162,pleasantville,L448421,u2502,DAVID,Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
57783,m162,pleasantville,L448419,u2502,DAVID,Yes I do.
57785,m162,pleasantville,L448417,u2502,DAVID,Yes I did.
57793,m162,pleasantville,L448025,u2502,DAVID,I thought the books were blank?
57795,m162,pleasantville,L448014,u2502,DAVID,Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
57797,m162,pleasantville,L448012,u2502,DAVID,Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
57800,m162,pleasantville,L448008,u2502,DAVID,What?
57802,m162,pleasantville,L448483,u2502,DAVID,The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
57804,m162,pleasantville,L448481,u2502,DAVID,No not that hedge. The other one.
57806,m162,pleasantville,L448479,u2502,DAVID,What color is that hedge of yours?
57808,m162,pleasantville,L448477,u2502,DAVID,Mr. Simpson ...
57809,m162,pleasantville,L447674,u2502,DAVID,Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
57811,m162,pleasantville,L447672,u2502,DAVID,Hello Mr. Simpson.
57813,m162,pleasantville,L448520,u2506,JENNIFER,I've done the slut thing David. It's really kinda old.

57816,m162,pleasantville,L448517,u2502,DAVID,You got the admissions letter.
57817,m162,pleasantville,L448516,u2502,DAVID,Honestly ... no.
57818,m162,pleasantville,L448515,u2506,JENNIFER,Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
57819,m162,pleasantville,L448514,u2506,JENNIFER,I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
57820,m162,pleasantville,L448513,u2502,DAVID,This thing works. We could go home right now.

57824,m162,pleasantville,L448160,u2502,DAVID,Oh I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
57825,m162,pleasantville,L448159,u2506,JENNIFER,Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
57826,m162,pleasantville,L448158,u2502,DAVID,What?
57827,m162,pleasantville,L448157,u2506,JENNIFER,How come I'm still in black and white?

57835,m162,pleasantville,L448149,u2506,JENNIFER,Yeah ...

57846,m162,pleasantville,L448137,u2506,JENNIFER,Nothing?
57847,m162,pleasantville,L448136,u2502,DAVID,Nothing.
57848,m162,pleasantville,L448135,u2506,JENNIFER,What's wrong?
57849,m162,pleasantville,L448029,u2506,JENNIFER,But like only up to the part about the raft because I didn't read any farther.
57850,m162,pleasantville,L448028,u2502,DAVID,The pages filled in?
57851,m162,pleasantville,L448027,u2506,JENNIFER,Okay look this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade But I told them what I DID remember and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
57852,m162,pleasantville,L448004,u2502,DAVID,Sure.
57853,m162,pleasantville,L448003,u2506,JENNIFER,Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
57854,m162,pleasantville,L448002,u2502,DAVID,It's fine.
57855,m162,pleasantville,L448001,u2506,JENNIFER,Not directly anyhow ...
57856,m162,pleasantville,L448000,u2502,DAVID,It's okay.
57857,m162,pleasantville,L447999,u2506,JENNIFER,I had nothing to do with that fire.
57858,m162,pleasantville,L447902,u2502,DAVID,Really? It seems so fattening.
57859,m162,pleasantville,L447901,u2506,JENNIFER,Me too. Sounds swell.
57860,m162,pleasantville,L447891,u2506,JENNIFER,Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
57861,m162,pleasantville,L447890,u2502,DAVID,They don't have that kind of potential.

57863,m162,pleasantville,L447887,u2506,JENNIFER,I mean you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
57864,m162,pleasantville,L447886,u2506,JENNIFER,David nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
57865,m162,pleasantville,L447885,u2502,DAVID,They're happy like this.
57866,m162,pleasantville,L447884,u2506,JENNIFER,Well if I don't who will?
57867,m162,pleasantville,L447883,u2502,DAVID,You have no right to do this.
57868,m162,pleasantville,L447879,u2506,JENNIFER,Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know they don't want to be like this it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
57869,m162,pleasantville,L447878,u2502,DAVID,You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
57870,m162,pleasantville,L447877,u2506,JENNIFER,So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod what a tragedy.
57871,m162,pleasantville,L447876,u2502,DAVID,You can't do this Jennifer. I WARNED you.
57872,m162,pleasantville,L447867,u2506,JENNIFER,Nothing.
57873,m162,pleasantville,L447866,u2502,DAVID,What did you do to him?
57874,m162,pleasantville,L447809,u2502,DAVID,Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything I'll be right over there.
57875,m162,pleasantville,L447759,u2502,DAVID,Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
57876,m162,pleasantville,L447758,u2506,JENNIFER,He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
57877,m162,pleasantville,L447757,u2502,DAVID,Jen please ...
57878,m162,pleasantville,L447756,u2506,JENNIFER,So what's the point?
57879,m162,pleasantville,L447755,u2502,DAVID,They don't notice that kind of thing.
57880,m162,pleasantville,L447754,u2506,JENNIFER,What do you mean?
57881,m162,pleasantville,L447753,u2502,DAVID,He won't notice anyway.
57882,m162,pleasantville,L447752,u2506,JENNIFER,I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
57883,m162,pleasantville,L447751,u2502,DAVID,It's in your closet.
57884,m162,pleasantville,L447750,u2506,JENNIFER,I could like kill a guy with these things.
57885,m162,pleasantville,L447742,u2502,DAVID,I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
57886,m162,pleasantville,L447741,u2506,JENNIFER,I like--really need a cigarette too.
57887,m162,pleasantville,L447740,u2502,DAVID,Jen listen ...
57888,m162,pleasantville,L447739,u2506,JENNIFER,Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
57889,m162,pleasantville,L447738,u2502,DAVID,JENNIFER!
57890,m162,pleasantville,L447737,u2506,JENNIFER,I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!
57891,m162,pleasantville,L447736,u2502,DAVID,What were you doing in a library?
57892,m162,pleasantville,L447735,u2506,JENNIFER,I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
57893,m162,pleasantville,L447734,u2502,DAVID,What?
57894,m162,pleasantville,L447733,u2506,JENNIFER,It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
57895,m162,pleasantville,L447732,u2502,DAVID,One date Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
57896,m162,pleasantville,L447731,u2506,JENNIFER,No way.
57897,m162,pleasantville,L447699,u2502,DAVID,I don't think so.
57898,m162,pleasantville,L447698,u2506,JENNIFER,Can we do any better?
57899,m162,pleasantville,L447697,u2502,DAVID,Peggy Jane Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.

57904,m162,pleasantville,L447691,u2506,JENNIFER,Who's that?
57905,m162,pleasantville,L447684,u2502,DAVID,To who?
57906,m162,pleasantville,L447683,u2506,JENNIFER,Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
57907,m162,pleasantville,L447682,u2502,DAVID,We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
57908,m162,pleasantville,L447681,u2506,JENNIFER,No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!

57910,m162,pleasantville,L447679,u2506,JENNIFER,Play along?
57911,m162,pleasantville,L447678,u2502,DAVID,We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
57912,m162,pleasantville,L447677,u2506,JENNIFER,Okay now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!

57916,m162,pleasantville,L447669,u2502,DAVID,We're supposed to be in school.
57917,m162,pleasantville,L447668,u2506,JENNIFER,I still don't see why we're doing this.
57918,m162,pleasantville,L447667,u2506,JENNIFER,All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.
57919,m162,pleasantville,L447666,u2502,DAVID,Just take deep breaths.
57920,m162,pleasantville,L447665,u2506,JENNIFER,I'm gonna hurl David. I swear to God.
57921,m162,pleasantville,L447655,u2506,JENNIFER,Neither do I.
57922,m162,pleasantville,L447654,u2502,DAVID,I don't believe this.
57923,m162,pleasantville,L447646,u2502,DAVID,I don't know ... It's not possible ...  Is it possible?
57924,m162,pleasantville,L447645,u2506,JENNIFER,What's going to happen?
57925,m162,pleasantville,L447644,u2502,DAVID,Oh God.
57926,m162,pleasantville,L447627,u2502,DAVID,You--you gotta get us out of here.

57931,m162,pleasantville,L447608,u2502,DAVID,I'm not sure.

58003,m162,pleasantville,L447991,u2502,DAVID,Oh. Thanks Margaret.
58005,m162,pleasantville,L447515,u2502,DAVID,Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
58007,m162,pleasantville,L447513,u2502,DAVID,Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
58009,m162,pleasantville,L447509,u2502,DAVID,Marmalade.

58012,m162,pleasantville,L447506,u2502,DAVID,Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
58014,m162,pleasantville,L448453,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
58015,m162,pleasantville,L448452,u2502,DAVID,There's worse places.
58016,m162,pleasantville,L448451,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,This is TV pal. They don't fool around.
58017,m162,pleasantville,L448450,u2502,DAVID,I'm going on trial tomorrow?
58018,m162,pleasantville,L448449,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Now Buddy you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries and that's rounding down.
58019,m162,pleasantville,L448447,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Much less than that.  An hour and a half.
58020,m162,pleasantville,L448446,u2502,DAVID,I don't know ... Three four weeks.
58021,m162,pleasantville,L448445,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,How long do you think you've been here?
58022,m162,pleasantville,L448444,u2502,DAVID,They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
58023,m162,pleasantville,L448443,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...
58024,m162,pleasantville,L448442,u2502,DAVID,I'm sorry. I can't do that.
58025,m162,pleasantville,L448441,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Just gimme the damn remote!
58026,m162,pleasantville,L448440,u2502,DAVID,So ... I guess as long as I'm here all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
58027,m162,pleasantville,L448439,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you?  It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came.
58028,m162,pleasantville,L448438,u2502,DAVID,Why don't you just take me back without it?
58029,m162,pleasantville,L448437,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Because you're coming home.
58030,m162,pleasantville,L448436,u2502,DAVID,Why?
58031,m162,pleasantville,L448435,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Okay let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
58032,m162,pleasantville,L448434,u2502,DAVID,I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
58033,m162,pleasantville,L448433,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Hope you're proud of yourself.
58034,m162,pleasantville,L448368,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!
58035,m162,pleasantville,L448367,u2502,DAVID,I'm going to leave now.
58036,m162,pleasantville,L448366,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,OW!
58037,m162,pleasantville,L448365,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
58038,m162,pleasantville,L448364,u2502,DAVID,I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
58039,m162,pleasantville,L448363,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,EXCUSE ME?
58040,m162,pleasantville,L448362,u2502,DAVID,No you're not.
58041,m162,pleasantville,L448361,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
58042,m162,pleasantville,L448360,u2502,DAVID,Why?
58043,m162,pleasantville,L448359,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Where's the remote control I gave you?
58044,m162,pleasantville,L448356,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Oh no? Let me show you something!
58045,m162,pleasantville,L448355,u2502,DAVID,I didn't do anything wrong.
58046,m162,pleasantville,L448354,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
58047,m162,pleasantville,L448353,u2502,DAVID,... Only if they mean it.
58048,m162,pleasantville,L448352,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
58049,m162,pleasantville,L448351,u2502,DAVID,Look ...
58050,m162,pleasantville,L448350,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in again?
58051,m162,pleasantville,L448349,u2502,DAVID,I had nothing to do with that.
58052,m162,pleasantville,L448346,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
58053,m162,pleasantville,L448345,u2502,DAVID,What do you mean?
58054,m162,pleasantville,L448343,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,NOW!
58055,m162,pleasantville,L448342,u2502,DAVID,Oh--well ...
58056,m162,pleasantville,L448341,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,I want a word with you ...
58057,m162,pleasantville,L448134,u2502,DAVID,Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
58058,m162,pleasantville,L448133,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,BUD.
58059,m162,pleasantville,L448132,u2502,DAVID,Well they're not just cookies. I mean they're great cookies ... Look I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
58060,m162,pleasantville,L448131,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Excuse me?
58061,m162,pleasantville,L448129,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
58062,m162,pleasantville,L448128,u2502,DAVID,Re-runs?
58063,m162,pleasantville,L448127,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
58064,m162,pleasantville,L448125,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
58065,m162,pleasantville,L448124,u2502,DAVID,Talk about it. Right now I mean. I got to ... um ...
58066,m162,pleasantville,L448123,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,What?
58067,m162,pleasantville,L448122,u2502,DAVID,I can't.
58068,m162,pleasantville,L448121,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,So even though I can't make any promises well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
58069,m162,pleasantville,L448119,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Well c'mere young fella.
58070,m162,pleasantville,L448118,u2502,DAVID,... Hi.

58073,m162,pleasantville,L447642,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
58074,m162,pleasantville,L447641,u2502,DAVID,WAIT A MINUTE!!
58075,m162,pleasantville,L447640,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
58076,m162,pleasantville,L447639,u2502,DAVID,Where are you going ...
58077,m162,pleasantville,L447638,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
58078,m162,pleasantville,L447637,u2502,DAVID,Don't get upset.
58079,m162,pleasantville,L447635,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
58080,m162,pleasantville,L447634,u2502,DAVID,Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
58081,m162,pleasantville,L447631,u2502,DAVID,My name's David.
58082,m162,pleasantville,L447629,u2502,DAVID,Because we don't belong!
58083,m162,pleasantville,L447628,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Why would I do that?
58084,m162,pleasantville,L447619,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're in ...  You know ...
58085,m162,pleasantville,L447618,u2502,DAVID,What the hell's going on!
58086,m162,pleasantville,L447617,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,... See every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
58087,m162,pleasantville,L447588,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
58088,m162,pleasantville,L447587,u2502,DAVID,How much does it cost?
58089,m162,pleasantville,L447585,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.

58101,m162,pleasantville,L447562,u2502,DAVID,You know we didn't call any TV repair.
58102,m162,pleasantville,L447561,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
58103,m162,pleasantville,L447560,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,We'll get you fixed up in no time.
58104,m162,pleasantville,L447559,u2502,DAVID,Yeah ... Sort of ...
58105,m162,pleasantville,L447558,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
58106,m162,pleasantville,L448532,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Just a little--You know.
58107,m162,pleasantville,L448531,u2502,DAVID,It's beautiful.
58108,m162,pleasantville,L448528,u2502,DAVID,You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
58109,m162,pleasantville,L448527,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
58110,m162,pleasantville,L448413,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
58111,m162,pleasantville,L448412,u2502,DAVID,It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
58112,m162,pleasantville,L448104,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,No that's not it.
58113,m162,pleasantville,L448103,u2502,DAVID,Oh well--you're just starting out. I mean you can't do it ...
58114,m162,pleasantville,L448102,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,I'll never be able to do that.
58115,m162,pleasantville,L448101,u2502,DAVID,What's wrong?
58116,m162,pleasantville,L448097,u2502,DAVID,Open it.
58117,m162,pleasantville,L448096,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Oh my Gosh Bud ...
58118,m162,pleasantville,L448095,u2502,DAVID,It's an art book.
58119,m162,pleasantville,L448094,u2502,DAVID,I brought you something ... From the library.
58120,m162,pleasantville,L448093,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Aren't you a little early?
58121,m162,pleasantville,L448092,u2502,DAVID,Hi.
58122,m162,pleasantville,L448091,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Oh hi.
58123,m162,pleasantville,L447929,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
58124,m162,pleasantville,L447928,u2502,DAVID,Yeah.
58125,m162,pleasantville,L447927,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Really?
58126,m162,pleasantville,L447926,u2502,DAVID,I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
58127,m162,pleasantville,L447925,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Well don't you?
58128,m162,pleasantville,L447923,u2502,DAVID,Wow ... That's pretty good ...
58129,m162,pleasantville,L447921,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Christmastime.
58130,m162,pleasantville,L447920,u2502,DAVID,... What's that?
58131,m162,pleasantville,L447919,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,You know what I really like?
58132,m162,pleasantville,L447918,u2502,DAVID,So they can have their hamburgers!
58133,m162,pleasantville,L447917,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Why?
58134,m162,pleasantville,L447916,u2502,DAVID,Look you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it you just gotta do it anyway.
58135,m162,pleasantville,L447915,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
58136,m162,pleasantville,L447914,u2502,DAVID,Forget about that!
58137,m162,pleasantville,L447913,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,... Like the other night when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
58138,m162,pleasantville,L447912,u2502,DAVID,Just listen to me ...
58139,m162,pleasantville,L447911,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same you know? Grill the bun flip the meat melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
58140,m162,pleasantville,L447910,u2502,DAVID,What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
58141,m162,pleasantville,L447909,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
58142,m162,pleasantville,L447906,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Oh--what's the point Bud?
58143,m162,pleasantville,L447905,u2502,DAVID,Look. I thought we talked about this I thought we said ...
58144,m162,pleasantville,L447904,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,There aren't any cheeseburgers.
58145,m162,pleasantville,L447903,u2502,DAVID,Two cheeseburgers two cherry cokes.
58146,m162,pleasantville,L447857,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself.
58147,m162,pleasantville,L447856,u2502,DAVID,Yeah ...
58148,m162,pleasantville,L447855,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,You know how when we close up I close the register then you lower the shades then I turn out the lights then we both lock the doors.
58149,m162,pleasantville,L447854,u2502,DAVID,Yeah ...
58150,m162,pleasantville,L447853,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Bud ...
58151,m162,pleasantville,L447852,u2502,DAVID,Oh yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
58152,m162,pleasantville,L447851,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
58153,m162,pleasantville,L447850,u2502,DAVID,Oh hi!
58154,m162,pleasantville,L447783,u2502,DAVID,Well you can just put on the lettuce finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
58155,m162,pleasantville,L447782,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Yes.
58156,m162,pleasantville,L447781,u2502,DAVID,Have you cooked the burgers?
58157,m162,pleasantville,L447780,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,... Yeah.
58158,m162,pleasantville,L447779,u2502,DAVID,Do you have the lettuce?
58159,m162,pleasantville,L447778,u2502,DAVID,Listen to me!
58160,m162,pleasantville,L447777,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Well usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
58161,m162,pleasantville,L447776,u2502,DAVID,What?
58162,m162,pleasantville,L447775,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,There aren't any cheeseburgers.
58163,m162,pleasantville,L447771,u2502,DAVID,I understand.
58164,m162,pleasantville,L447770,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,I'm so glad you're here.
58165,m162,pleasantville,L447769,u2502,DAVID,You know if this ever happens again you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
58166,m162,pleasantville,L447767,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
58167,m162,pleasantville,L447766,u2502,DAVID,Yeah ...
58168,m162,pleasantville,L447765,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
58169,m162,pleasantville,L447764,u2502,DAVID,What's wrong?
58170,m162,pleasantville,L447762,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Oh.
58171,m162,pleasantville,L447761,u2502,DAVID,Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
58172,m162,pleasantville,L447760,u2509,MR. JOHNSON,Bud?
58173,m162,pleasantville,L447633,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
58174,m162,pleasantville,L447632,u2506,JENNIFER,Oh GOD ...
58175,m162,pleasantville,L447624,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Well you don't have to worry about that anymore.
58176,m162,pleasantville,L447623,u2506,JENNIFER,This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
58177,m162,pleasantville,L447622,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Dream come true hunh?
58178,m162,pleasantville,L447616,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,A miracle.
58179,m162,pleasantville,L447615,u2506,JENNIFER,What happened?
58180,m162,pleasantville,L447614,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
58181,m162,pleasantville,L447590,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
58182,m162,pleasantville,L447589,u2506,JENNIFER,Free?
58183,m162,pleasantville,L447576,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
58184,m162,pleasantville,L447575,u2506,JENNIFER,Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
58185,m162,pleasantville,L447570,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?
58186,m162,pleasantville,L447569,u2506,JENNIFER,That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
58187,m162,pleasantville,L447568,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Gosh I loved that show. Watched it for years.
58188,m162,pleasantville,L447565,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,What's the rush?
58189,m162,pleasantville,L447564,u2506,JENNIFER,You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
58190,m162,pleasantville,L447557,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Well here I am.
58191,m162,pleasantville,L447556,u2506,JENNIFER,Yeah ...
58192,m162,pleasantville,L447555,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,Yeah. TV busted?
58193,m162,pleasantville,L447554,u2506,JENNIFER,TV repair?
58194,m162,pleasantville,L447553,u2503,DICK VAN DYKE,TV repair.
58196,m162,pleasantville,L447532,u2506,JENNIFER,Cool.
58199,m162,pleasantville,L447528,u2506,JENNIFER,So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
58200,m162,pleasantville,L447527,u2506,JENNIFER,Yeah ... Saw you too.
58202,m162,pleasantville,L447523,u2506,JENNIFER,Hey.
58964,m165,rko 281,L469159,u2557,WELLES,That poor woman.
58966,m165,rko 281,L469153,u2557,WELLES,Carole you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
58968,m165,rko 281,L469151,u2557,WELLES,Oh but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
58970,m165,rko 281,L469147,u2557,WELLES,Am I?
58972,m165,rko 281,L469145,u2557,WELLES,I wonder sometimes.
58974,m165,rko 281,L469143,u2557,WELLES,Not you too
58977,m165,rko 281,L469090,u2557,WELLES,No when I was but a tender lad--
58978,m165,rko 281,L469089,u2557,WELLES,Ever met Walter Winchell?
58979,m165,rko 281,L469654,u2551,MARION,But I am That's the killer honey.
58981,m165,rko 281,L469652,u2551,MARION,The character that's supposed to be me Susan Alexander--
58983,m165,rko 281,L469650,u2551,MARION,You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
58984,m165,rko 281,L469649,u2551,MARION,Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
58986,m165,rko 281,L469647,u2551,MARION,Thing that bothers me now though looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
58988,m165,rko 281,L469645,u2551,MARION,I did my best but well you know me
58990,m165,rko 281,L469642,u2551,MARION,When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
58991,m165,rko 281,L469131,u2551,MARION,He needs me here.
58993,m165,rko 281,L469129,u2551,MARION,I can't
58996,m165,rko 281,L469126,u2551,MARION,And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
58998,m165,rko 281,L469124,u2551,MARION,Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
58999,m165,rko 281,L469123,u2551,MARION,It's not so bad here. After all what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
59000,m165,rko 281,L469122,u2551,MARION,With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
59002,m165,rko 281,L469120,u2551,MARION,That's why he has the parties he says it's like bringing the world to me.
59004,m165,rko 281,L469118,u2551,MARION,God these parties are the worst
59006,m165,rko 281,L469071,u2551,MARION,And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
59007,m165,rko 281,L469815,u2547,HEARST,So where does that leave us Mr. Welles? What kind of sad future are we two making? A future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies? A future where no price is too high for fame and power? When we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard?
59008,m165,rko 281,L469814,u2557,WELLES,Elegant words sir when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
59009,m165,rko 281,L469813,u2547,HEARST,Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief perhaps you will think it old fashioned undoubtedly you will but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
59010,m165,rko 281,L469812,u2557,WELLES,Do you?
59011,m165,rko 281,L469811,u2547,HEARST,I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
59012,m165,rko 281,L469107,u2557,WELLES,I'll remember that.
59013,m165,rko 281,L469106,u2547,HEARST,In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
59014,m165,rko 281,L469105,u2557,WELLES,So I've been told.
59015,m165,rko 281,L469104,u2547,HEARST,Well I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
59016,m165,rko 281,L469101,u2557,WELLES,To make pictures.
59017,m165,rko 281,L469100,u2547,HEARST,I see. And you are in California for what reason?
59018,m165,rko 281,L469099,u2557,WELLES,And director.
59019,m165,rko 281,L469098,u2547,HEARST,The actor
59020,m165,rko 281,L469097,u2557,WELLES,My name is Orson Welles
59021,m165,rko 281,L469096,u2547,HEARST,Who are you sir?
59023,m165,rko 281,L469494,u2547,HEARST,See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture won't you?
59025,m165,rko 281,L469491,u2547,HEARST,Why is that Louis?
59026,m165,rko 281,L469490,u2547,HEARST,Oh why is that?
59028,m165,rko 281,L469488,u2547,HEARST,And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
59030,m165,rko 281,L469484,u2547,HEARST,Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
59032,m165,rko 281,L469482,u2547,HEARST,Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
59034,m165,rko 281,L469480,u2547,HEARST,Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
59035,m165,rko 281,L469478,u2547,HEARST,Hope you don't mind my popping in--
59037,m165,rko 281,L469476,u2547,HEARST,Louis
59038,m165,rko 281,L469641,u2547,HEARST,There is nothing to understand but this:   I am a man who could have been great but was not.
59039,m165,rko 281,L469640,u2551,MARION,I don't want you to--
59040,m165,rko 281,L469639,u2547,HEARST,castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
59041,m165,rko 281,L469638,u2547,HEARST,No you don't. You want to condemn me like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
59042,m165,rko 281,L469637,u2551,MARION,I just want to understand--
59043,m165,rko 281,L469636,u2547,HEARST,I will not have this in my home.
59044,m165,rko 281,L469635,u2551,MARION,Fuck you Mr. Kane.
59045,m165,rko 281,L469634,u2547,HEARST,You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't  t-t-t-tolerate it.
59046,m165,rko 281,L469633,u2551,MARION,Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
59047,m165,rko 281,L469632,u2547,HEARST,You are repellant when you drink.
59048,m165,rko 281,L469631,u2551,MARION,You will not walk out on me
59049,m165,rko 281,L469630,u2547,HEARST,That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
59050,m165,rko 281,L469629,u2551,MARION,But why? Just so you can show it all off -- just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?!
59051,m165,rko 281,L469628,u2547,HEARST,Not for me.
59052,m165,rko 281,L469627,u2551,MARION,There's a different between want and
59053,m165,rko 281,L469626,u2547,HEARST,I wanted it
59054,m165,rko 281,L469625,u2551,MARION,Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
59055,m165,rko 281,L469624,u2547,HEARST,You needn't use that language with me
59056,m165,rko 281,L469623,u2551,MARION,I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
59057,m165,rko 281,L469622,u2547,HEARST,It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
59058,m165,rko 281,L469621,u2551,MARION,That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
59059,m165,rko 281,L469620,u2551,MARION,You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
59060,m165,rko 281,L469619,u2547,HEARST,You are being typically theatrical Marion. I need the Tribune to--
59061,m165,rko 281,L469618,u2551,MARION,You don't have any money left okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it nobody else will say it but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
59062,m165,rko 281,L469617,u2547,HEARST,There is nothing to discuss-
59063,m165,rko 281,L469616,u2551,MARION,You gotta wake up now. Pops.
59064,m165,rko 281,L469614,u2551,MARION,I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
59065,m165,rko 281,L469613,u2547,HEARST,I will not defend my life to you--
59066,m165,rko 281,L469612,u2551,MARION,A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
59067,m165,rko 281,L469611,u2547,HEARST,There's nothing to explain
59068,m165,rko 281,L469610,u2551,MARION,Then you explain it to me?!
59069,m165,rko 281,L469570,u2551,MARION,I am not that woman.
59070,m165,rko 281,L469569,u2547,HEARST,This picture--
59071,m165,rko 281,L469568,u2551,MARION,Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
59072,m165,rko 281,L469567,u2547,HEARST,Marion--
59073,m165,rko 281,L469566,u2551,MARION,Nailed us hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
59074,m165,rko 281,L469565,u2551,MARION,Well -- he got us didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
59075,m165,rko 281,L469522,u2547,HEARST,One . . . buys things.
59076,m165,rko 281,L469521,u2551,MARION,How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
59077,m165,rko 281,L469520,u2547,HEARST,Yes.
59078,m165,rko 281,L469519,u2551,MARION,We're 125 million dollars in debt?
59079,m165,rko 281,L469517,u2551,MARION,How much?
59080,m165,rko 281,L469516,u2547,HEARST,It's not really--
59081,m165,rko 281,L469515,u2551,MARION,How much?
59082,m165,rko 281,L469514,u2547,HEARST,The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.
59083,m165,rko 281,L469513,u2551,MARION,Pops
59084,m165,rko 281,L469512,u2547,HEARST,Nothing for you to worry about darling
59085,m165,rko 281,L469511,u2551,MARION,How bad is it?
59086,m165,rko 281,L469507,u2551,MARION,Don't
59087,m165,rko 281,L469506,u2547,HEARST,He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
59088,m165,rko 281,L469505,u2551,MARION,You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president after all.
59089,m165,rko 281,L469504,u2547,HEARST,The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
59090,m165,rko 281,L469298,u2551,MARION,Nuts. She only cares about the money. She thinks I'll make you cut her out of the w-w-w-w...  will.
59091,m165,rko 281,L469297,u2547,HEARST,She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin apparently.
59092,m165,rko 281,L469296,u2551,MARION,There. That's right.
59093,m165,rko 281,L469294,u2547,HEARST,Darling I talked to Millicent.
59094,m165,rko 281,L469293,u2551,MARION,This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--
59095,m165,rko 281,L469158,u2551,MARION,There certainly is I There certainly is! Aw to hell with you!
59096,m165,rko 281,L469157,u2547,HEARST,There's no call for that language-
59097,m165,rko 281,L469156,u2551,MARION,Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
59098,m165,rko 281,L469468,u2547,HEARST,Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both
59100,m165,rko 281,L469466,u2547,HEARST,And how do you feel when you are lied to?
59103,m165,rko 281,L469463,u2547,HEARST,Please be quiet.
59105,m165,rko 281,L469461,u2547,HEARST,I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
59107,m165,rko 281,L469459,u2547,HEARST,Why did we not know about this sooner?
59109,m165,rko 281,L469457,u2547,HEARST,Miss Parsons I have one additional question for you.
59111,m165,rko 281,L469455,u2547,HEARST,Thank you for your time
59113,m165,rko 281,L469452,u2547,HEARST,Yes?
59115,m165,rko 281,L469450,u2547,HEARST,How so?
59117,m165,rko 281,L469410,u2557,WELLES,You're not going to get another chance boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--
59119,m165,rko 281,L469408,u2557,WELLES,This is the chance you've been waiting for boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
59120,m165,rko 281,L469407,u2557,WELLES,Then make them up! You're drunk and you're angry.
59122,m165,rko 281,L469405,u2557,WELLES,Keep filming.
59123,m165,rko 281,L469263,u2557,WELLES,I am not doing Hearst.
59125,m165,rko 281,L469261,u2557,WELLES,That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
59127,m165,rko 281,L469259,u2557,WELLES,Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
59129,m165,rko 281,L469257,u2557,WELLES,We're using-
59131,m165,rko 281,L469247,u2557,WELLES,What we are going to do is shoot life -- in all it's joyous complexity.
59133,m165,rko 281,L469245,u2557,WELLES,Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
59135,m165,rko 281,L469502,u2554,SCHAEFER,Can I talk to Hearst?
59137,m165,rko 281,L469500,u2554,SCHAEFER,Oh for God's sake Louella-
59139,m165,rko 281,L469498,u2554,SCHAEFER,Louella please be reasonable I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
59142,m165,rko 281,L469442,u2554,SCHAEFER,Hearst?
59144,m165,rko 281,L469440,u2554,SCHAEFER,He personally asked you to?
59146,m165,rko 281,L469438,u2554,SCHAEFER,That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
59148,m165,rko 281,L469436,u2554,SCHAEFER,No -- no -- I mean--
59150,m165,rko 281,L469434,u2554,SCHAEFER,Louella hello I was just fixing a drink would you like--?
59152,m165,rko 281,L469843,u2550,MANK,Yeah you're probably right.
59153,m165,rko 281,L469842,u2557,WELLES,You know all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
59154,m165,rko 281,L469838,u2550,MANK,Aw cheer up George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink.
59155,m165,rko 281,L469837,u2557,WELLES,What have I done?
59156,m165,rko 281,L469835,u2557,WELLES,George...
59157,m165,rko 281,L469834,u2550,MANK,Shit
59158,m165,rko 281,L469826,u2550,MANK,Face it Orson they're gonna hate it. I told you not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
59159,m165,rko 281,L469825,u2557,WELLES,Mank!
59160,m165,rko 281,L469824,u2550,MANK,Hell I know how it ends.  Hey Rosebud's the sled!
59161,m165,rko 281,L469823,u2557,WELLES,You gonna watch?
59162,m165,rko 281,L469793,u2550,MANK,This ain't George's doing--!
59163,m165,rko 281,L469792,u2557,WELLES,YOU STUPID LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?
59164,m165,rko 281,L469777,u2550,MANK,Kinda.
59165,m165,rko 281,L469776,u2557,WELLES,Is that from one of the Gospels?
59166,m165,rko 281,L469557,u2550,MANK,I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes okay? I got my check kid and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
59167,m165,rko 281,L469556,u2557,WELLES,You wrote the damn thing Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
59168,m165,rko 281,L469555,u2550,MANK,They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
59169,m165,rko 281,L469554,u2557,WELLES,It's too late. The movie's made
59170,m165,rko 281,L469553,u2550,MANK,If he had known about KANE before you made it you'd be dead already.
59171,m165,rko 281,L469551,u2557,WELLES,What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
59172,m165,rko 281,L469550,u2550,MANK,Believe you me they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
59173,m165,rko 281,L469549,u2557,WELLES,What does this have to do with--?
59174,m165,rko 281,L469548,u2550,MANK,Me I'm proud to be a Jew I got no problem. You don't like it fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
59175,m165,rko 281,L469547,u2557,WELLES,Christ.
59176,m165,rko 281,L469546,u2550,MANK,This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
59177,m165,rko 281,L469545,u2557,WELLES,So they're Jews. . .
59178,m165,rko 281,L469543,u2550,MANK,Jews. She's talking about Jews.
59179,m165,rko 281,L469542,u2557,WELLES,Hedy Lamarr?
59180,m165,rko 281,L469540,u2557,WELLES,Well at least she's off KANE today
59181,m165,rko 281,L469534,u2550,MANK,No you gotta hear this-
59182,m165,rko 281,L469533,u2557,WELLES,Mank sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
59183,m165,rko 281,L469532,u2550,MANK,Hey kid. Gregg.
59184,m165,rko 281,L469377,u2557,WELLES,He was a drunk. And he was my father and I was ashamed of him.
59185,m165,rko 281,L469376,u2550,MANK,I don't give a shit about-
59186,m165,rko 281,L469375,u2557,WELLES,Did I ever tell you about my father?
59187,m165,rko 281,L469371,u2550,MANK,I don't care.
59188,m165,rko 281,L469370,u2557,WELLES,I'm sorry.
59189,m165,rko 281,L469369,u2550,MANK,Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
59190,m165,rko 281,L469368,u2557,WELLES,I want you back
59191,m165,rko 281,L469367,u2557,WELLES,I just can't . . see it anymore
59192,m165,rko 281,L469366,u2550,MANK,Uh huh.
59193,m165,rko 281,L469365,u2557,WELLES,And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
59194,m165,rko 281,L469285,u2550,MANK,YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!
59195,m165,rko 281,L469284,u2557,WELLES,Jesus Christ --
59196,m165,rko 281,L469280,u2557,WELLES,To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
59197,m165,rko 281,L469279,u2550,MANK,I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--
59198,m165,rko 281,L469278,u2557,WELLES,But it's not a great syllable
59199,m165,rko 281,L469277,u2550,MANK,Craig is one syllable
59200,m165,rko 281,L469276,u2557,WELLES,K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
59201,m165,rko 281,L469275,u2550,MANK,Cain -- like the Bible guy?
59202,m165,rko 281,L469273,u2550,MANK,The title?
59203,m165,rko 281,L469272,u2557,WELLES,Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
59204,m165,rko 281,L469271,u2550,MANK,What?
59205,m165,rko 281,L469270,u2557,WELLES,Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping of course and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
59206,m165,rko 281,L469269,u2550,MANK,It's good huh?
59207,m165,rko 281,L469266,u2557,WELLES,It is 350 pages of ... ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION!
59208,m165,rko 281,L469265,u2550,MANK,Yeah but the margins are real wide.
59209,m165,rko 281,L469264,u2557,WELLES,It's 350 pages long.
59210,m165,rko 281,L469231,u2550,MANK,And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
59211,m165,rko 281,L469230,u2557,WELLES,The people. When they pay him homage he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
59212,m165,rko 281,L469229,u2550,MANK,And what does he see?
59213,m165,rko 281,L469228,u2557,WELLES,Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
59214,m165,rko 281,L469227,u2557,WELLES,He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.

59221,m165,rko 281,L469215,u2550,MANK,Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
59222,m165,rko 281,L469214,u2557,WELLES,How?
59223,m165,rko 281,L469213,u2550,MANK,Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
59224,m165,rko 281,L469212,u2557,WELLES,So who is he? We have to know him.
59225,m165,rko 281,L469209,u2557,WELLES,Then let him. What have we got to lose you and I?

59230,m165,rko 281,L469203,u2550,MANK,And yeah sure Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
59231,m165,rko 281,L469202,u2557,WELLES,It doesn't have to be
59232,m165,rko 281,L469201,u2550,MANK,When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
59233,m165,rko 281,L469200,u2550,MANK,I don't have it anymore?!
59234,m165,rko 281,L469199,u2557,WELLES,I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
59235,m165,rko 281,L469198,u2550,MANK,Fuck you--

59237,m165,rko 281,L469196,u2550,MANK,Let me out.
59238,m165,rko 281,L469194,u2557,WELLES,--Because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a sycophant! Because he has been thrown out of every studio in Hollywood and no one will hire him because he's a drunk- -!
59239,m165,rko 281,L469193,u2550,MANK,Don't do this
59240,m165,rko 281,L469192,u2557,WELLES,Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
59241,m165,rko 281,L469191,u2550,MANK,Don't do this
59242,m165,rko 281,L469190,u2557,WELLES,I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
59243,m165,rko 281,L469188,u2557,WELLES,How does it feel Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
59244,m165,rko 281,L469187,u2550,MANK,Sorry to disappoint.
59245,m165,rko 281,L469186,u2557,WELLES,I expected more from you.

59248,m165,rko 281,L469183,u2550,MANK,You may think you know what you're talking about kid but believe me you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
59249,m165,rko 281,L469182,u2557,WELLES,We're doing Hearst.
59250,m165,rko 281,L469181,u2550,MANK,Howard Hughes he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
59251,m165,rko 281,L469180,u2550,MANK,Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
59252,m165,rko 281,L469179,u2557,WELLES,Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
59253,m165,rko 281,L469178,u2550,MANK,Orson. Stop. Just stop
59254,m165,rko 281,L469177,u2557,WELLES,How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
59255,m165,rko 281,L469176,u2550,MANK,Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
59256,m165,rko 281,L469175,u2557,WELLES,Mank-
59257,m165,rko 281,L469174,u2550,MANK,Please don't say this.
59258,m165,rko 281,L469173,u2557,WELLES,Yes.
59259,m165,rko 281,L469172,u2550,MANK,Oh Christ
59260,m165,rko 281,L469171,u2557,WELLES,Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
59261,m165,rko 281,L469170,u2550,MANK,Oh Christ...
59262,m165,rko 281,L469169,u2557,WELLES,Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man like a baron living in a palace a glorious palace on a hill and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
59263,m165,rko 281,L469168,u2550,MANK,This better be good
59264,m165,rko 281,L469167,u2557,WELLES,I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
59265,m165,rko 281,L469166,u2550,MANK,Oh for Christ's sake-
59266,m165,rko 281,L469165,u2557,WELLES,Listen ... I've got it! It came to me like a thief in the night! Pure inspiration! Total magnificence!
59267,m165,rko 281,L469164,u2550,MANK,Okay boy wonder what?
59268,m165,rko 281,L469163,u2557,WELLES,Here you are up with the birds for once you vampire!
59269,m165,rko 281,L469162,u2550,MANK,Orson please ... it's too bright
59270,m165,rko 281,L469161,u2557,WELLES,Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
59271,m165,rko 281,L469135,u2550,MANK,Yeah it's the place God would have built if he'd had the money.
59272,m165,rko 281,L469134,u2557,WELLES,Jesus
59273,m165,rko 281,L469133,u2550,MANK,The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
59274,m165,rko 281,L469116,u2550,MANK,No baby those are the hands of a killer
59275,m165,rko 281,L469115,u2557,WELLES,Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
59276,m165,rko 281,L469113,u2557,WELLES,He's nothing but a hypocrite. He preaches morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the world but he lives openly with his mistress.
59277,m165,rko 281,L469112,u2550,MANK,The old man has his own way of doing things
59278,m165,rko 281,L469111,u2557,WELLES,The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
59279,m165,rko 281,L469082,u2557,WELLES,No it's perfect! When in doubt put on a cape! False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and Booth.  Imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian plains--
59280,m165,rko 281,L469081,u2550,MANK,I don't wanna write about no spic.
59281,m165,rko 281,L469080,u2557,WELLES,The great Spanish bullfighter
59282,m165,rko 281,L469079,u2550,MANK,Who the hell's Manolete?
59283,m165,rko 281,L469078,u2557,WELLES,Manolete?!
59284,m165,rko 281,L469077,u2550,MANK,Kid you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so goddamn smart.
59285,m165,rko 281,L469076,u2557,WELLES,Sigmund Freud?
59286,m165,rko 281,L469070,u2550,MANK,Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
59287,m165,rko 281,L469069,u2557,WELLES,Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
59288,m165,rko 281,L469068,u2550,MANK,I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead baby. Just like Jean Harlow
59289,m165,rko 281,L469067,u2557,WELLES,How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
59290,m165,rko 281,L469065,u2550,MANK,Christ we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.

59292,m165,rko 281,L469063,u2550,MANK,Like a bug.
59293,m165,rko 281,L469062,u2557,WELLES,We find the man and then we dissect him-
59294,m165,rko 281,L469061,u2550,MANK,Right-
59295,m165,rko 281,L469060,u2557,WELLES,So we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
59296,m165,rko 281,L469058,u2550,MANK,You're a laugh-riot kid.
59297,m165,rko 281,L469057,u2557,WELLES,That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
59298,m165,rko 281,L469056,u2550,MANK,Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
59299,m165,rko 281,L469055,u2557,WELLES,Not for me.
59300,m165,rko 281,L469054,u2550,MANK,Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
59301,m165,rko 281,L469053,u2557,WELLES,Magic
59302,m165,rko 281,L469052,u2550,MANK,Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane not Tristan and Isolde.

59384,m165,rko 281,L469675,u2554,SCHAEFER,Well it' s all you've got !
59385,m165,rko 281,L469673,u2554,SCHAEFER,Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
59386,m165,rko 281,L469672,u2557,WELLES,Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!
59387,m165,rko 281,L469671,u2554,SCHAEFER,You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
59388,m165,rko 281,L469670,u2557,WELLES,Then find another theater
59389,m165,rko 281,L469669,u2554,SCHAEFER,What do you want me to do Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
59390,m165,rko 281,L469473,u2557,WELLES,The ad..
59391,m165,rko 281,L469472,u2554,SCHAEFER,And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
59392,m165,rko 281,L469424,u2557,WELLES,The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
59393,m165,rko 281,L469423,u2554,SCHAEFER,They've all seen a rough cut
59394,m165,rko 281,L469422,u2557,WELLES,This is an abomination There's no music and--
59395,m165,rko 281,L469318,u2557,WELLES,Ah it's a grand title.
59396,m165,rko 281,L469317,u2554,SCHAEFER,For the title
59397,m165,rko 281,L469312,u2554,SCHAEFER,It's the safe bet Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
59398,m165,rko 281,L469311,u2557,WELLES,Please don't ask me to do this.
59399,m165,rko 281,L469310,u2554,SCHAEFER,Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
59400,m165,rko 281,L469309,u2557,WELLES,Jesus
59401,m165,rko 281,L469308,u2554,SCHAEFER,Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
59402,m165,rko 281,L469307,u2554,SCHAEFER,Listen get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
59403,m165,rko 281,L469306,u2557,WELLES,I know I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
59404,m165,rko 281,L469305,u2554,SCHAEFER,Now look Orson let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
59405,m165,rko 281,L469303,u2554,SCHAEFER,CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
59406,m165,rko 281,L469302,u2557,WELLES,Pardon?
59407,m165,rko 281,L469301,u2554,SCHAEFER,CITIZEN KANE
59408,m165,rko 281,L469300,u2557,WELLES,It's an awful title of course but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or God forbid Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
59409,m165,rko 281,L469531,u2557,WELLES,Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
59411,m165,rko 281,L469529,u2557,WELLES,I'm Christ
59413,m165,rko 281,L469527,u2557,WELLES,Yes!
59415,m165,rko 281,L469417,u2557,WELLES,Yeah.
59417,m165,rko 281,L469415,u2557,WELLES,How 'bout a real drink?
59419,m165,rko 281,L469396,u2557,WELLES,Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
59421,m165,rko 281,L469394,u2557,WELLES,I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
59423,m165,rko 281,L469392,u2557,WELLES,It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
59424,m165,rko 281,L469359,u2557,WELLES,Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
64933,m190,stalag 17,L533279,u2889,HOFFY,You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
64935,m190,stalag 17,L533153,u2889,HOFFY,Plenty.
64937,m190,stalag 17,L533136,u2889,HOFFY,They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
64939,m190,stalag 17,L533134,u2889,HOFFY,I wouldn't talk about things like that.
64962,m190,stalag 17,L533555,u2889,HOFFY,Get going on the trap door.
64964,m190,stalag 17,L533553,u2889,HOFFY,Three's a crowd especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
64965,m190,stalag 17,L533500,u2889,HOFFY,Okay. Move on.
64967,m190,stalag 17,L533498,u2889,HOFFY,Ready?
64969,m190,stalag 17,L532941,u2889,HOFFY,Come on!
64971,m190,stalag 17,L532713,u2889,HOFFY,They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
64973,m190,stalag 17,L533614,u2894,SEFTON,So long Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
64974,m190,stalag 17,L533470,u2894,SEFTON,Yeah. Security.
64977,m190,stalag 17,L533467,u2894,SEFTON,That's not the point Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
64979,m190,stalag 17,L533465,u2894,SEFTON,Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
64981,m190,stalag 17,L533463,u2894,SEFTON,I understand how you feel Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed and how our radar operates. Could be couldn't it?
64983,m190,stalag 17,L533461,u2894,SEFTON,What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
64984,m190,stalag 17,L533143,u2894,SEFTON,We'll get some more.
64986,m190,stalag 17,L532735,u2894,SEFTON,That'll do.
64988,m190,stalag 17,L533603,u2894,SEFTON,Forget it.
64991,m190,stalag 17,L533567,u2894,SEFTON,Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
64992,m190,stalag 17,L533507,u2894,SEFTON,No? Aren't you a little afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound? For a tip-off like this you know what the Krauts would pay?
64994,m190,stalag 17,L533505,u2894,SEFTON,I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
64996,m190,stalag 17,L533421,u2894,SEFTON,Have a cigar.
64997,m190,stalag 17,L533400,u2894,SEFTON,Why not?
64999,m190,stalag 17,L533398,u2894,SEFTON,Take it.
65001,m190,stalag 17,L533255,u2894,SEFTON,You're all wire happy boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
65003,m190,stalag 17,L533253,u2894,SEFTON,Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
65005,m190,stalag 17,L533039,u2894,SEFTON,A little something what?
65007,m190,stalag 17,L533037,u2894,SEFTON,I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
65008,m190,stalag 17,L533034,u2894,SEFTON,Ask Security.  You tell him Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
65010,m190,stalag 17,L533032,u2894,SEFTON,That's right.
65012,m190,stalag 17,L532944,u2894,SEFTON,Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh Duke?
65015,m190,stalag 17,L532900,u2894,SEFTON,You would would you? Listen Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package my blanket and my left shoe. Well I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
65017,m190,stalag 17,L532898,u2894,SEFTON,What's your beef boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
65018,m190,stalag 17,L532895,u2894,SEFTON,Look this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
65020,m190,stalag 17,L532891,u2894,SEFTON,Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
65023,m190,stalag 17,L532822,u2894,SEFTON,Private property bub.
65024,m190,stalag 17,L532748,u2894,SEFTON,Anybody here wanna double their bet?
65026,m190,stalag 17,L532721,u2894,SEFTON,No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
65029,m190,stalag 17,L533536,u2889,HOFFY,Then we're all in on it?
65031,m190,stalag 17,L533490,u2889,HOFFY,The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
65033,m190,stalag 17,L533228,u2889,HOFFY,How did he get over there?
65034,m190,stalag 17,L533043,u2889,HOFFY,There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
65036,m190,stalag 17,L533041,u2889,HOFFY,Break it off!
65038,m190,stalag 17,L532830,u2889,HOFFY,Come again?
65040,m190,stalag 17,L532740,u2889,HOFFY,Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
65042,m190,stalag 17,L532729,u2889,HOFFY,Put me down for ten you louse.
65043,m190,stalag 17,L532970,u2893,SCHULTZ,You are talking crazy!
65045,m190,stalag 17,L532966,u2893,SCHULTZ,Which one of you is what?
65047,m190,stalag 17,L532962,u2893,SCHULTZ,Tipping me off? I do not understand.
65050,m190,stalag 17,L532758,u2893,SCHULTZ,Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
65053,m190,stalag 17,L533645,u2894,SEFTON,Let's blow Chauncey.
65054,m190,stalag 17,L533635,u2894,SEFTON,We'll know in forty seconds.  Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.
65056,m190,stalag 17,L533633,u2894,SEFTON,You won't get off that cheap.
65058,m190,stalag 17,L533631,u2894,SEFTON,Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
65060,m190,stalag 17,L533629,u2894,SEFTON,What some brandy?
65062,m190,stalag 17,L533627,u2894,SEFTON,What did you expect a St. Bernard dog?
65064,m190,stalag 17,L533625,u2894,SEFTON,You'd better get that blue blood circulating because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
65066,m190,stalag 17,L533623,u2894,SEFTON,Shut off the moaning or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off Lieutenant. This is orders!
65067,m190,stalag 17,L533150,u2894,SEFTON,Look Lieutenant. All your dough won't help you here. Because here you're on your own. And no mother to throw you a lifebelt. Now let's see how good you can swim.
65069,m190,stalag 17,L533148,u2894,SEFTON,What did you expect glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
65070,m190,stalag 17,L533116,u2894,SEFTON,They've got a summer house in Nantucket with an upstairs polo field.  You better put a canopy over his bunk.
65072,m190,stalag 17,L533114,u2894,SEFTON,Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together remember? They turned me down but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
65074,m190,stalag 17,L533111,u2894,SEFTON,Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
65122,m190,stalag 17,L533190,u2893,SCHULTZ,And this?
65123,m190,stalag 17,L533189,u2888,HARRY,It's a mouse trap.
65124,m190,stalag 17,L533188,u2893,SCHULTZ,What is this? This is water?
65125,m190,stalag 17,L532974,u2893,SCHULTZ,Raus! Raus! All of you!
65126,m190,stalag 17,L532973,u2888,HARRY,Why don't we accept Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
65127,m190,stalag 17,L532957,u2893,SCHULTZ,Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
65128,m190,stalag 17,L532956,u2888,HARRY,Hey Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
65129,m190,stalag 17,L532950,u2888,HARRY,You should live so long.
65130,m190,stalag 17,L532949,u2893,SCHULTZ,You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
65131,m190,stalag 17,L532948,u2888,HARRY,Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?
65132,m190,stalag 17,L532790,u2893,SCHULTZ,Some are not bad at all.
65133,m190,stalag 17,L532789,u2888,HARRY,Jawohl!
65134,m190,stalag 17,L532771,u2893,SCHULTZ,Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
65135,m190,stalag 17,L532770,u2888,HARRY,Then droppen Sie dead!
65136,m190,stalag 17,L532769,u2893,SCHULTZ,Jawohl.
65137,m190,stalag 17,L532768,u2888,HARRY,Sprechen Sie deutsch?
65138,m190,stalag 17,L532767,u2893,SCHULTZ,Jawohl?
65139,m190,stalag 17,L532766,u2888,HARRY,Say Schulz --
65140,m190,stalag 17,L532765,u2893,SCHULTZ,Aufstehen gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
65141,m190,stalag 17,L533541,u2888,HARRY,No. I want to draw.
65142,m190,stalag 17,L533540,u2895,STOSH,You want to go?
65143,m190,stalag 17,L533539,u2888,HARRY,Let me do it Hoffy.
65144,m190,stalag 17,L533488,u2888,HARRY,This is me Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
65145,m190,stalag 17,L533487,u2895,STOSH,Betty! Betty!
65146,m190,stalag 17,L533486,u2888,HARRY,Animal! Animal! Wake up!
65147,m190,stalag 17,L533485,u2895,STOSH,I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
65148,m190,stalag 17,L533484,u2888,HARRY,Hey Animal! Animal!
65149,m190,stalag 17,L533483,u2895,STOSH,But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
65150,m190,stalag 17,L533478,u2888,HARRY,Why sure!
65151,m190,stalag 17,L533477,u2895,STOSH,May I have this dance Miss?
65152,m190,stalag 17,L533457,u2895,STOSH,There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
65153,m190,stalag 17,L533456,u2888,HARRY,You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
65154,m190,stalag 17,L533455,u2895,STOSH,It's that song Harry!
65155,m190,stalag 17,L533454,u2888,HARRY,You're crying Animal.
65156,m190,stalag 17,L533453,u2895,STOSH,Let me alone.
65157,m190,stalag 17,L533452,u2888,HARRY,Come on Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
65158,m190,stalag 17,L533429,u2895,STOSH,I'll open mine too.
65159,m190,stalag 17,L533428,u2888,HARRY,I'll open mine now.
65160,m190,stalag 17,L533426,u2888,HARRY,Animal! Got a little something for you!
65161,m190,stalag 17,L533425,u2895,STOSH,There Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
65162,m190,stalag 17,L533417,u2888,HARRY,Hey here's Esther Williams.
65163,m190,stalag 17,L533416,u2895,STOSH,Do Grable.
65164,m190,stalag 17,L533407,u2888,HARRY,Do Jimmy Durante!
65165,m190,stalag 17,L533406,u2895,STOSH,Grable not Gable!
65166,m190,stalag 17,L533212,u2895,STOSH,Come on you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
65167,m190,stalag 17,L533211,u2888,HARRY,Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
65168,m190,stalag 17,L533197,u2895,STOSH,You hold him. I'll slug him.

65171,m190,stalag 17,L533092,u2895,STOSH,Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening ain't it?
65172,m190,stalag 17,L533091,u2888,HARRY,So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth the fifth the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
65173,m190,stalag 17,L533090,u2895,STOSH,Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
65174,m190,stalag 17,L533089,u2888,HARRY,It's not good for you Animal.
65175,m190,stalag 17,L533088,u2895,STOSH,That's what I wanna hear.
65176,m190,stalag 17,L533087,u2888,HARRY,What do they always say?
65177,m190,stalag 17,L533086,u2895,STOSH,What do those broads say?
65178,m190,stalag 17,L533018,u2888,HARRY,Blind? How stupid can you get Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
65179,m190,stalag 17,L533017,u2895,STOSH,Harry -- I'm blind!
65180,m190,stalag 17,L533011,u2888,HARRY,Bombs away!
65181,m190,stalag 17,L533010,u2895,STOSH,She'll never forgive me!
65182,m190,stalag 17,L533009,u2888,HARRY,To the Brick Kremlin!
65183,m190,stalag 17,L533008,u2888,HARRY,Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
65184,m190,stalag 17,L533007,u2895,STOSH,You did?
65185,m190,stalag 17,L533006,u2888,HARRY,It takes a gimmick Animal and I figured us a little gimmick.
65186,m190,stalag 17,L533005,u2895,STOSH,How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
65187,m190,stalag 17,L533004,u2888,HARRY,Sure Animal! I'll get you over there!
65188,m190,stalag 17,L533003,u2895,STOSH,You'll fix me up!
65189,m190,stalag 17,L533002,u2888,HARRY,Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
65190,m190,stalag 17,L533001,u2895,STOSH,Not for me! Betty! Betty!
65191,m190,stalag 17,L533000,u2888,HARRY,So what? There's other women!
65192,m190,stalag 17,L532999,u2895,STOSH,Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
65193,m190,stalag 17,L532993,u2895,STOSH,You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?
65194,m190,stalag 17,L532992,u2888,HARRY,I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
65195,m190,stalag 17,L532991,u2895,STOSH,Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
65196,m190,stalag 17,L532988,u2895,STOSH,Come on baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
65197,m190,stalag 17,L532987,u2888,HARRY,Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you Animal?
65198,m190,stalag 17,L532939,u2895,STOSH,He's the grrrrreatest!
65199,m190,stalag 17,L532938,u2888,HARRY,Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
65200,m190,stalag 17,L532897,u2888,HARRY,He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
65201,m190,stalag 17,L532896,u2895,STOSH,Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
65202,m190,stalag 17,L532887,u2888,HARRY,Plant it Animal and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
65203,m190,stalag 17,L532886,u2895,STOSH,Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
65204,m190,stalag 17,L532880,u2895,STOSH,It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
65205,m190,stalag 17,L532879,u2888,HARRY,Don't you remember Animal? A chicken lays those things.
65206,m190,stalag 17,L532876,u2895,STOSH,Where'd that come from?
65207,m190,stalag 17,L532875,u2888,HARRY,Easy Animal! Easy!
65208,m190,stalag 17,L532873,u2888,HARRY,No. Your eyeball goes. The top of your head. Gotta wind up with athlete's stomach.

65212,m190,stalag 17,L532860,u2895,STOSH,You're teasing me again!
65213,m190,stalag 17,L532859,u2888,HARRY,If she don't want you she don't get anything.
65214,m190,stalag 17,L532858,u2895,STOSH,Me? What if she don't want me?
65215,m190,stalag 17,L532857,u2888,HARRY,What d'ya think jerko! You're the award!
65216,m190,stalag 17,L532856,u2895,STOSH,What's the award?
65217,m190,stalag 17,L532855,u2888,HARRY,How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say 'Congratulations Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with and I'm here to present the award'.
65218,m190,stalag 17,L532854,u2895,STOSH,Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
65219,m190,stalag 17,L532853,u2888,HARRY,Animal! When the war's over remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
65220,m190,stalag 17,L532852,u2888,HARRY,Betty Grable!
65221,m190,stalag 17,L532851,u2895,STOSH,Let me go!
65222,m190,stalag 17,L532850,u2888,HARRY,You want Betty Grable!
65223,m190,stalag 17,L532849,u2895,STOSH,I don't care if they wear galoshes!
65224,m190,stalag 17,L532848,u2888,HARRY,No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
65225,m190,stalag 17,L532847,u2895,STOSH,Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
65226,m190,stalag 17,L532846,u2888,HARRY,It's chow Animal! Chow!
65227,m190,stalag 17,L532844,u2888,HARRY,They'll shoot you Animal!
65228,m190,stalag 17,L532843,u2895,STOSH,Let me go! Let me go!
65229,m190,stalag 17,L532840,u2895,STOSH,Lay off! The blonde is mine!
65230,m190,stalag 17,L532839,u2888,HARRY,Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!

65233,m190,stalag 17,L532835,u2895,STOSH,Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
65234,m190,stalag 17,L532821,u2895,STOSH,I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
65235,m190,stalag 17,L532820,u2888,HARRY,I'm telling you Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
65236,m190,stalag 17,L532819,u2895,STOSH,You can say that again!
65237,m190,stalag 17,L532818,u2888,HARRY,I'm telling you Animal these Nazis ain't Kosher.
65238,m190,stalag 17,L532817,u2895,STOSH,'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
65239,m190,stalag 17,L532780,u2888,HARRY,Let go Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
65240,m190,stalag 17,L532779,u2895,STOSH,I'll kill you Harry -- so help me!
65241,m190,stalag 17,L532778,u2888,HARRY,Hamburger and onions! Strawberry shortcake! Gefillte fish! Banana split! French fried potatoes! Chicken a la king!
65242,m190,stalag 17,L532777,u2895,STOSH,Why do you do this to me every morning?
65243,m190,stalag 17,L532776,u2888,HARRY,Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
65244,m190,stalag 17,L532775,u2895,STOSH,Stop it Harry!
65245,m190,stalag 17,L532774,u2888,HARRY,Good morning Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
65246,m190,stalag 17,L532745,u2895,STOSH,Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
65247,m190,stalag 17,L532744,u2888,HARRY,Shut up Animal!
65248,m190,stalag 17,L532711,u2888,HARRY,Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
65249,m190,stalag 17,L532710,u2895,STOSH,When you get going on those broads think of me!
65251,m190,stalag 17,L533276,u2889,HOFFY,Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
65252,m190,stalag 17,L533263,u2889,HOFFY,Yes sir.
65255,m190,stalag 17,L533260,u2889,HOFFY,Yes sir.
65258,m190,stalag 17,L532807,u2889,HOFFY,Yes. According to the Geneva Convention dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
65260,m190,stalag 17,L532805,u2889,HOFFY,As the duly elected Compound Chief I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
65262,m190,stalag 17,L532803,u2889,HOFFY,Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
65263,m190,stalag 17,L533559,u2889,HOFFY,Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
65265,m190,stalag 17,L533557,u2889,HOFFY,You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
65267,m190,stalag 17,L533548,u2889,HOFFY,Any objections men?
65269,m190,stalag 17,L533546,u2889,HOFFY,We've all done a poor job of it.
65271,m190,stalag 17,L533544,u2889,HOFFY,No volunteers Price. I said we're all in on it.
65272,m190,stalag 17,L533514,u2889,HOFFY,We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
65274,m190,stalag 17,L533504,u2889,HOFFY,Good.
65276,m190,stalag 17,L533502,u2889,HOFFY,Maybe it's crazy but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
65278,m190,stalag 17,L533493,u2889,HOFFY,I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
65281,m190,stalag 17,L533198,u2889,HOFFY,It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is he's sure batting a thousand.
65283,m190,stalag 17,L533156,u2889,HOFFY,Cut the horseplay Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
65284,m190,stalag 17,L533036,u2889,HOFFY,Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
65287,m190,stalag 17,L532963,u2889,HOFFY,You're wasting your time Duke.  Outside everybody! Let's get it over with.
65288,m190,stalag 17,L532925,u2889,HOFFY,Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
65290,m190,stalag 17,L532825,u2889,HOFFY,Kill it Duke. It's got us all spinning.
65292,m190,stalag 17,L533437,u2889,HOFFY,Come on everybody!  Let's go!
65293,m190,stalag 17,L533436,u2893,SCHULTZ,You must get out. For your own good you must get out.
65294,m190,stalag 17,L533182,u2893,SCHULTZ,The one you are hiding in the barrack don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
65295,m190,stalag 17,L533181,u2889,HOFFY,What radio?
65296,m190,stalag 17,L533180,u2893,SCHULTZ,One more thing gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
65297,m190,stalag 17,L533179,u2889,HOFFY,We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone the blankets were gone.
65298,m190,stalag 17,L532764,u2889,HOFFY,Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
65299,m190,stalag 17,L532763,u2893,SCHULTZ,Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
65300,m190,stalag 17,L532762,u2889,HOFFY,Lay off Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
65301,m190,stalag 17,L532761,u2893,SCHULTZ,Los los. Dummkopf!
65302,m190,stalag 17,L533620,u2894,SEFTON,Check.
65303,m190,stalag 17,L533619,u2889,HOFFY,Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two sharp.
65304,m190,stalag 17,L533618,u2894,SEFTON,You could use a new one yourself.
65305,m190,stalag 17,L533612,u2889,HOFFY,Shoot!
65306,m190,stalag 17,L533611,u2894,SEFTON,Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say Barracks' Chief?
65307,m190,stalag 17,L533610,u2889,HOFFY,What's the decoy?
65308,m190,stalag 17,L533609,u2894,SEFTON,I told you boys I'm no escape artist but for the first time I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.
65309,m190,stalag 17,L533608,u2894,SEFTON,You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
65310,m190,stalag 17,L533607,u2889,HOFFY,You taking Dunbar?
65311,m190,stalag 17,L533605,u2894,SEFTON,Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
65312,m190,stalag 17,L533604,u2889,HOFFY,What are we going to do with him?
65313,m190,stalag 17,L533592,u2894,SEFTON,He's a Nazi Price is. For all I know his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure he lived in Cleveland but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school gave him phony dogtags --
65314,m190,stalag 17,L533591,u2889,HOFFY,Go on.
65315,m190,stalag 17,L533580,u2894,SEFTON,Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
65316,m190,stalag 17,L533579,u2889,HOFFY,You off your rocker?
65317,m190,stalag 17,L533578,u2894,SEFTON,You did!
65318,m190,stalag 17,L533577,u2889,HOFFY,Who did?
65319,m190,stalag 17,L533576,u2894,SEFTON,You told them Hoffy.
65320,m190,stalag 17,L533575,u2889,HOFFY,How do they know?
65321,m190,stalag 17,L533572,u2894,SEFTON,I called it the last time didn't I?
65322,m190,stalag 17,L533571,u2889,HOFFY,Look Sefton I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
65323,m190,stalag 17,L533570,u2894,SEFTON,That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
65324,m190,stalag 17,L533569,u2889,HOFFY,Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do Sefton? Gum up the works?
65325,m190,stalag 17,L533563,u2894,SEFTON,Anybody cover?
65326,m190,stalag 17,L533562,u2889,HOFFY,You starting that again?
65327,m190,stalag 17,L533561,u2894,SEFTON,Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
65328,m190,stalag 17,L533512,u2889,HOFFY,Okay Price. You stay.
65329,m190,stalag 17,L533511,u2894,SEFTON,So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
65330,m190,stalag 17,L533510,u2889,HOFFY,Right.
65331,m190,stalag 17,L533509,u2894,SEFTON,Okay then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
65332,m190,stalag 17,L533508,u2889,HOFFY,You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
65333,m190,stalag 17,L533322,u2894,SEFTON,Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
65334,m190,stalag 17,L533321,u2889,HOFFY,You heard that Sefton?
65335,m190,stalag 17,L533257,u2894,SEFTON,It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
65336,m190,stalag 17,L533256,u2889,HOFFY,What's it add up to you Sefton?
65337,m190,stalag 17,L533249,u2894,SEFTON,There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
65338,m190,stalag 17,L533248,u2889,HOFFY,We did it.
65339,m190,stalag 17,L533247,u2894,SEFTON,What happened Cookie? Who did it?
65340,m190,stalag 17,L533242,u2894,SEFTON,Borscht?
65341,m190,stalag 17,L533241,u2889,HOFFY,I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
65342,m190,stalag 17,L533240,u2894,SEFTON,What's the matter boys? Is my slip showing?
65343,m190,stalag 17,L533119,u2889,HOFFY,Lay off I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
65344,m190,stalag 17,L533118,u2894,SEFTON,With your mother's pull how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
65345,m190,stalag 17,L533117,u2889,HOFFY,Lay off Sefton.
65346,m190,stalag 17,L533028,u2889,HOFFY,Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
65347,m190,stalag 17,L533027,u2894,SEFTON,You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
65348,m190,stalag 17,L533026,u2889,HOFFY,Says me.
65349,m190,stalag 17,L533025,u2894,SEFTON,Says who?
65350,m190,stalag 17,L533024,u2889,HOFFY,What's the big idea Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
65351,m190,stalag 17,L532935,u2889,HOFFY,Are we boring you?
65352,m190,stalag 17,L532934,u2894,SEFTON,If you can't get the BBC how about getting Guy Lombardo?
65353,m190,stalag 17,L532889,u2894,SEFTON,A little weak today.
65354,m190,stalag 17,L532888,u2889,HOFFY,If I were you Sefton I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
65355,m190,stalag 17,L532725,u2889,HOFFY,Go on Sefton -- butt out!
65356,m190,stalag 17,L532724,u2894,SEFTON,Anybody call?
65357,m190,stalag 17,L532706,u2894,SEFTON,Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
65358,m190,stalag 17,L532705,u2889,HOFFY,Stay out of it Sefton.
65359,m190,stalag 17,L533068,u2895,STOSH,Oh.
65361,m190,stalag 17,L533066,u2895,STOSH,Yeah?
65362,m190,stalag 17,L533063,u2895,STOSH,Just what makes you so popular?
65364,m190,stalag 17,L533061,u2895,STOSH,Nothing for Kuzawa?
65367,m190,stalag 17,L532915,u2895,STOSH,You can tell Father Murray to --
65369,m190,stalag 17,L533598,u2894,SEFTON,The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
65371,m190,stalag 17,L533590,u2894,SEFTON,Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you boys?
65373,m190,stalag 17,L533588,u2894,SEFTON,What time?
65375,m190,stalag 17,L533586,u2894,SEFTON,Shut up!  Security Officer eh? Screening everybody only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor Price? Or don't you know?
65377,m190,stalag 17,L533584,u2894,SEFTON,Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
65379,m190,stalag 17,L533582,u2894,SEFTON,Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput Price.
65381,m190,stalag 17,L533574,u2894,SEFTON,The Germans know where Dunbar is.
65383,m190,stalag 17,L533531,u2894,SEFTON,Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
65385,m190,stalag 17,L533529,u2894,SEFTON,Amazing what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls isn't it?
65387,m190,stalag 17,L533527,u2894,SEFTON,Ach so!
65388,m190,stalag 17,L533526,u2894,SEFTON,A lot of people say that and the first thing you know is they get married and live happily ever after.  I wonder what they're trying to pull out there?
65390,m190,stalag 17,L533524,u2894,SEFTON,Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
65392,m190,stalag 17,L533522,u2894,SEFTON,Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
65394,m190,stalag 17,L533520,u2894,SEFTON,I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
65396,m190,stalag 17,L533518,u2894,SEFTON,I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland aren't you.
65398,m190,stalag 17,L533516,u2894,SEFTON,Or how about a game of pinochle? No you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way doesn't it?
65399,m190,stalag 17,L533251,u2894,SEFTON,What about the radio?
65401,m190,stalag 17,L533030,u2894,SEFTON,They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
65403,m190,stalag 17,L532908,u2894,SEFTON,I'll tell you how come.  The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you our Security Officer said it'd be safe. That's how come.
65405,m190,stalag 17,L532906,u2894,SEFTON,And what's that crack supposed to mean?
65406,m190,stalag 17,L532905,u2894,SEFTON,I wasn't so sure. I just liked the odds.
65408,m190,stalag 17,L532903,u2894,SEFTON,Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you boys?
65410,m190,stalag 17,L533445,u2893,SCHULTZ,Wie hat er's gemacht?
65412,m190,stalag 17,L533443,u2893,SCHULTZ,Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
65413,m190,stalag 17,L533186,u2893,SCHULTZ,All right gentlemen I will find it myself. Now let's see.
65415,m190,stalag 17,L533184,u2893,SCHULTZ,Give me the radio.
65417,m190,stalag 17,L532968,u2893,SCHULTZ,You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
65419,m190,stalag 17,L532786,u2893,SCHULTZ,Ja ja gewiss! It is only that we are cramped for space with new prisoners every day.  Gentlemen! Outside! Please! Do you want me to have trouble with the Kommandant again!
65421,m190,stalag 17,L532784,u2893,SCHULTZ,Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
65422,m190,stalag 17,L532756,u2893,SCHULTZ,Ach terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
65424,m190,stalag 17,L533439,u2894,SEFTON,Not particularly.
65425,m190,stalag 17,L533438,u2893,SCHULTZ,What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
65426,m190,stalag 17,L533307,u2894,SEFTON,How many do you want? A thousand?
65427,m190,stalag 17,L533306,u2893,SCHULTZ,Talk what? I do not know anything!
65428,m190,stalag 17,L533305,u2894,SEFTON,You'd better talk Schulz because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
65429,m190,stalag 17,L533304,u2893,SCHULTZ,No! No!
65430,m190,stalag 17,L533303,u2894,SEFTON,I'll make it five hundred!
65431,m190,stalag 17,L533302,u2894,SEFTON,Yes you do!
65432,m190,stalag 17,L533301,u2893,SCHULTZ,I do not want those cigarettes.
65433,m190,stalag 17,L533300,u2894,SEFTON,The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
65434,m190,stalag 17,L533299,u2893,SCHULTZ,What guy?
65435,m190,stalag 17,L533298,u2894,SEFTON,Who's the guy Schulz?
65436,m190,stalag 17,L533297,u2893,SCHULTZ,Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
65437,m190,stalag 17,L533296,u2894,SEFTON,And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
65438,m190,stalag 17,L533295,u2893,SCHULTZ,Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
65439,m190,stalag 17,L533294,u2894,SEFTON,Here. Take them.
65440,m190,stalag 17,L533293,u2893,SCHULTZ,You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
65441,m190,stalag 17,L533292,u2894,SEFTON,How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
65442,m190,stalag 17,L533291,u2893,SCHULTZ,Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
65443,m190,stalag 17,L532972,u2893,SCHULTZ,You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
65444,m190,stalag 17,L532971,u2894,SEFTON,No use Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
65445,m190,stalag 17,L532783,u2893,SCHULTZ,Fine -- fine!
65446,m190,stalag 17,L532782,u2894,SEFTON,Good morning Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
65447,m190,stalag 17,L532781,u2893,SCHULTZ,Good morning Sefton.
65448,m190,stalag 17,L533192,u2893,SCHULTZ,Look at them Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
65449,m190,stalag 17,L533191,u2895,STOSH,My grandmother's ear-muffs.
65450,m190,stalag 17,L533178,u2893,SCHULTZ,The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new clean blanket.
65451,m190,stalag 17,L533177,u2895,STOSH,We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
65452,m190,stalag 17,L533176,u2893,SCHULTZ,Gentlemen tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
65453,m190,stalag 17,L532960,u2893,SCHULTZ,It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here.
65454,m190,stalag 17,L532959,u2895,STOSH,Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
65455,m190,stalag 17,L532958,u2893,SCHULTZ,All right gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
65456,m190,stalag 17,L532955,u2893,SCHULTZ,Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
65457,m190,stalag 17,L532954,u2895,STOSH,Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
65458,m190,stalag 17,L532953,u2893,SCHULTZ,That is my wife.
65459,m190,stalag 17,L532952,u2895,STOSH,Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
65460,m190,stalag 17,L532951,u2893,SCHULTZ,This is me in Cincinnati.
65461,m190,stalag 17,L532947,u2893,SCHULTZ,Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
65462,m190,stalag 17,L532946,u2895,STOSH,Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
65463,m190,stalag 17,L532945,u2893,SCHULTZ,Did I interrupt something gentlemen?
65464,m190,stalag 17,L532792,u2893,SCHULTZ,Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
65465,m190,stalag 17,L532791,u2895,STOSH,Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
65466,m190,stalag 17,L532788,u2893,SCHULTZ,Russian women prisoners?
65467,m190,stalag 17,L532787,u2895,STOSH,Hey Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
65468,m190,stalag 17,L533617,u2894,SEFTON,Tell you what to do. First get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
65469,m190,stalag 17,L533616,u2895,STOSH,You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
65470,m190,stalag 17,L533596,u2894,SEFTON,Okay Herr Preismaier let's have the mail box.
65471,m190,stalag 17,L533595,u2895,STOSH,You heard him.
65472,m190,stalag 17,L533316,u2895,STOSH,Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
65473,m190,stalag 17,L533315,u2894,SEFTON,So you're stuck with me eh?
65474,m190,stalag 17,L533244,u2894,SEFTON,Oh! Somebody was peeking!
65475,m190,stalag 17,L533243,u2895,STOSH,Have a nice time over there?
65476,m190,stalag 17,L533056,u2895,STOSH,Come on let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
65477,m190,stalag 17,L533055,u2894,SEFTON,You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead Cookie.
65478,m190,stalag 17,L532893,u2894,SEFTON,What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
65479,m190,stalag 17,L532892,u2895,STOSH,That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
65480,m190,stalag 17,L532883,u2894,SEFTON,Just don't drool on it.
65481,m190,stalag 17,L532882,u2895,STOSH,Is it all right if we smell it?
65482,m190,stalag 17,L532878,u2895,STOSH,A chicken?
65483,m190,stalag 17,L532877,u2894,SEFTON,From a chicken bug-wit.
70521,m203,the godfather,L593445,u3102,HAGEN,You owe the Don a service.  He has no doubt that you will repay it.
70523,m203,the godfather,L593443,u3102,HAGEN,This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone at his request.
70524,m203,the godfather,L593425,u3102,HAGEN,Yes. 
70526,m203,the godfather,L593423,u3102,HAGEN,Good.  He never doubted you.
70528,m203,the godfather,L593421,u3102,HAGEN,You owe the Don a service.  In one hour not before perhaps later he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now and I'll inform him.
70530,m203,the godfather,L593432,u3098,DON CORLEONE,I want you to use all your powers all your skill as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
70532,m203,the godfather,L592864,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Some day and that day may never come I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
70534,m203,the godfather,L592862,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
70536,m203,the godfather,L592860,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Then take the justice from the judge the bitter with the sweet Bonasera.  But if you come to me with your friendship your loyalty then your enemies become my enemies and then believe me they would fear you...
70538,m203,the godfather,L592858,u3098,DON CORLEONE,You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right the Police protects you there are Courts of Law so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
70540,m203,the godfather,L592856,u3098,DON CORLEONE,But your daughter is still alive.
70542,m203,the godfather,L592854,u3098,DON CORLEONE,The Court gave you justice.
70544,m203,the godfather,L592852,u3098,DON CORLEONE,No.  You ask for too much.
70545,m203,the godfather,L592851,u3098,DON CORLEONE,And what is that Bonasera?
70547,m203,the godfather,L592849,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Bonasera we know each other for years but this is the first time you come to me for help.  I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.
70548,m203,the godfather,L593724,u3105,MICHAEL,Good good.  Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport.
70550,m203,the godfather,L593722,u3105,MICHAEL,Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all I'm Godfather to your son.  No your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you Tattaglia or Barzini?
70551,m203,the godfather,L593721,u3105,MICHAEL,Barzini is dead.  So is Philip Tattaglia so are Strachi Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did.
70553,m203,the godfather,L593719,u3105,MICHAEL,You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
70554,m203,the godfather,L593718,u3105,MICHAEL,You have to answer for Santino.
70556,m203,the godfather,L593704,u3105,MICHAEL,Go back to your house and wait for me...
70558,m203,the godfather,L593638,u3105,MICHAEL,I'll come to you when I need you.
70574,m203,the godfather,L593326,u3112,SONNY,You're on kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
70576,m203,the godfather,L593324,u3112,SONNY,I want somebody very good very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
70577,m203,the godfather,L593235,u3112,SONNY,OK but be careful.
70580,m203,the godfather,L593228,u3112,SONNY,You take care of Paulie?
70581,m203,the godfather,L593185,u3112,SONNY,Okay now you can move your men into the Mall replace Tessio's people.  Mike tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show.  That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.
70583,m203,the godfather,L593183,u3112,SONNY,Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
70584,m203,the godfather,L593099,u3112,SONNY,No just you and Paulie.
70586,m203,the godfather,L593097,u3112,SONNY,Go get Paulie I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself and bring him to my father's house.
70588,m203,the godfather,L593095,u3112,SONNY,How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
70590,m203,the godfather,L593093,u3112,SONNY,Where the hell was Paulie why wasn't he with the Don?
70592,m203,the godfather,L593091,u3112,SONNY,Yeah.
70594,m203,the godfather,L593628,u3105,MICHAEL,Maybe less...
70596,m203,the godfather,L593626,u3105,MICHAEL,He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides if I ever need any advice who's a better Consigliere than my father.
70597,m203,the godfather,L593620,u3105,MICHAEL,No I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
70600,m203,the godfather,L593311,u3105,MICHAEL,How bad will it be?
70616,m203,the godfather,L593024,u3098,DON CORLEONE,No.
70618,m203,the godfather,L593022,u3098,DON CORLEONE,No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years I won't risk that out of greed.
70620,m203,the godfather,L593018,u3098,DON CORLEONE,So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations is that what you tell me?
70622,m203,the godfather,L593016,u3098,DON CORLEONE,And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
70624,m203,the godfather,L593014,u3098,DON CORLEONE,What percentages for my family?
70626,m203,the godfather,L593012,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
70628,m203,the godfather,L592971,u3098,DON CORLEONE,I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
70630,m203,the godfather,L592969,u3098,DON CORLEONE,You look terrible.  I want you to eat well to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then at the end of the month this big shot will give you the part you want.
70632,m203,the godfather,L592967,u3098,DON CORLEONE,You take care of your family?
70634,m203,the godfather,L592965,u3098,DON CORLEONE,All right Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
70636,m203,the godfather,L592956,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich or too famous that I can't help you?
70638,m203,the godfather,L593651,u3102,HAGEN,Maybe I can help.
70639,m203,the godfather,L593650,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Tom I never thought you were a bad Consigliere I thought Santino a bad Don rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence as you do.  For reasons which you can't know you must have no part in what will happen.
70640,m203,the godfather,L593461,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No it was Barzini all along.
70641,m203,the godfather,L593460,u3102,HAGEN,He was the one behind Sollozzo?
70642,m203,the godfather,L593459,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Barzini.
70643,m203,the godfather,L593458,u3102,HAGEN,You mean Tattaglia.
70644,m203,the godfather,L593457,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Mention it don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
70645,m203,the godfather,L593456,u3102,HAGEN,When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
70646,m203,the godfather,L593439,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Now you've had your drink.
70647,m203,the godfather,L593438,u3102,HAGEN,Yes.
70648,m203,the godfather,L593437,u3098,DON CORLEONE,But you needed a drink first.
70649,m203,the godfather,L593436,u3102,HAGEN,I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
70650,m203,the godfather,L593435,u3098,DON CORLEONE,My wife was weeping before she fell asleep outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house and it is midnight.  So Consigliere of mine I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
70651,m203,the godfather,L593030,u3102,HAGEN,It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
70652,m203,the godfather,L593029,u3098,DON CORLEONE,What is this nonsense?
70653,m203,the godfather,L592976,u3102,HAGEN,I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.
70654,m203,the godfather,L592975,u3098,DON CORLEONE,No give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else Tom?
70655,m203,the godfather,L592974,u3102,HAGEN,They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law do we give him something important?
70656,m203,the godfather,L592973,u3098,DON CORLEONE,When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
70657,m203,the godfather,L592949,u3102,HAGEN,It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
70658,m203,the godfather,L592948,u3098,DON CORLEONE,No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
70659,m203,the godfather,L592947,u3102,HAGEN,Should I bring him in.
70660,m203,the godfather,L592946,u3098,DON CORLEONE,It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
70661,m203,the godfather,L592944,u3098,DON CORLEONE,On a day like this.  Consiglero do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.
70662,m203,the godfather,L592943,u3102,HAGEN,This morning.
70663,m203,the godfather,L592942,u3098,DON CORLEONE,When did he call?
70664,m203,the godfather,L592941,u3102,HAGEN,Two terms; one in Italy one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
70665,m203,the godfather,L592940,u3098,DON CORLEONE,And with prison record.
70666,m203,the godfather,L592939,u3102,HAGEN,He's his own boss and very competent.
70667,m203,the godfather,L592937,u3102,HAGEN,The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally but said you'd understand.  Also some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
70668,m203,the godfather,L592936,u3098,DON CORLEONE,I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
70669,m203,the godfather,L592890,u3102,HAGEN,You understand him better than anyone.
70670,m203,the godfather,L592889,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Is it necessary?
70671,m203,the godfather,L593663,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Good.
70672,m203,the godfather,L593662,u3105,MICHAEL,Yes.
70673,m203,the godfather,L593661,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
70674,m203,the godfather,L593659,u3098,DON CORLEONE,He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust.  That person will arrange a meeting guarantee your safety...
70675,m203,the godfather,L593658,u3105,MICHAEL,How?
70676,m203,the godfather,L593657,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Barzini will move against you first.
70677,m203,the godfather,L593655,u3105,MICHAEL,I'll need him.
70678,m203,the godfather,L593654,u3098,DON CORLEONE,I see you have your Luca Brasi.
70679,m203,the godfather,L593644,u3105,MICHAEL,How did you find out?
70680,m203,the godfather,L593643,u3098,DON CORLEONE,I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
70681,m203,the godfather,L593553,u3098,DON CORLEONE,What else do you believe in?
70682,m203,the godfather,L593552,u3105,MICHAEL,A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
70683,m203,the godfather,L593551,u3098,DON CORLEONE,You are like me we refuse to be fools to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
70684,m203,the godfather,L593550,u3105,MICHAEL,Then why have I become a man like you?
70685,m203,the godfather,L593549,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Yes but sons who would be professors scientists musicians...and grandchildren who could be who knows a Governor a President even nothing's impossible here in America.
70686,m203,the godfather,L593548,u3105,MICHAEL,You wanted me to be your son.
70687,m203,the godfather,L593547,u3098,DON CORLEONE,No I wanted other things for you.
70688,m203,the godfather,L593546,u3105,MICHAEL,I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born you had laid this all out for me.
70689,m203,the godfather,L593545,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Accept what's happened Michael.
70690,m203,the godfather,L593544,u3105,MICHAEL,I want children I want a family. But I don't know when.
70691,m203,the godfather,L593543,u3098,DON CORLEONE,I understand Michael.  But you must make a family you know.
70692,m203,the godfather,L593542,u3105,MICHAEL,No.
70693,m203,the godfather,L593541,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Have you thought about a wife?  A family?
70694,m203,the godfather,L592991,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Good.  When you are finished come and talk to me.  I have hopes for you.
70695,m203,the godfather,L592990,u3105,MICHAEL,I'm going to finish school.
70696,m203,the godfather,L592989,u3098,DON CORLEONE,And now what do you choose to do?
70697,m203,the godfather,L592988,u3105,MICHAEL,I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
70698,m203,the godfather,L592987,u3098,DON CORLEONE,What miracles you do for strangers.
70699,m203,the godfather,L592986,u3105,MICHAEL,For killing a man.
70700,m203,the godfather,L592985,u3098,DON CORLEONE,And this?
70701,m203,the godfather,L592984,u3105,MICHAEL,For bravery.
70702,m203,the godfather,L592983,u3098,DON CORLEONE,What was this for?
70703,m203,the godfather,L592982,u3105,MICHAEL,Tom said he'd take care of it.
70704,m203,the godfather,L592981,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
70706,m203,the godfather,L592880,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Tom what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
70708,m203,the godfather,L592878,u3098,DON CORLEONE,You want him to stay in this country.
70710,m203,the godfather,L592876,u3098,DON CORLEONE,Nazorine my friend tell me what I can do.
70713,m203,the godfather,L593526,u3105,MICHAEL,What is it?
70715,m203,the godfather,L593524,u3105,MICHAEL,Is that why there are more men on the walls?
70717,m203,the godfather,L593522,u3105,MICHAEL,Things went badly in Palermo?
70718,m203,the godfather,L593474,u3105,MICHAEL,No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
70720,m203,the godfather,L593472,u3105,MICHAEL,Don Tommassino...I should see this place.
70722,m203,the godfather,L593470,u3105,MICHAEL,I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
70724,m203,the godfather,L593468,u3105,MICHAEL,Corleone.
70726,m203,the godfather,L593466,u3105,MICHAEL,I know.
70728,m203,the godfather,L593464,u3105,MICHAEL,Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
70730,m203,the godfather,L593462,u3105,MICHAEL,Don Tommassino.
70731,m203,the godfather,L593530,u3105,MICHAEL,No she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...
70733,m203,the godfather,L593528,u3105,MICHAEL,Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
70734,m203,the godfather,L593487,u3105,MICHAEL,Shhhhh.
70736,m203,the godfather,L593481,u3105,MICHAEL,Yes.
70738,m203,the godfather,L593479,u3105,MICHAEL,Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
70740,m203,the godfather,L593477,u3105,MICHAEL,How do you know I come from America?
70750,m203,the godfather,L593599,u3105,MICHAEL,The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say say it to me.
70752,m203,the godfather,L593575,u3105,MICHAEL,I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
70754,m203,the godfather,L593572,u3105,MICHAEL,Get rid of them...
70756,m203,the godfather,L593570,u3105,MICHAEL,Give them some money and send them home.
70758,m203,the godfather,L593568,u3105,MICHAEL,Who are those girls?
70759,m203,the godfather,L593567,u3105,MICHAEL,Come here a minute Fredo.
70761,m203,the godfather,L593565,u3105,MICHAEL,No.
70763,m203,the godfather,L593561,u3105,MICHAEL,You look good too.
70766,m203,the godfather,L593558,u3105,MICHAEL,Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
70767,m203,the godfather,L593393,u3112,SONNY,Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco who do I have?  Hey Tom hey...hey.  It's Sunday we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore.
70768,m203,the godfather,L593392,u3102,HAGEN,Yes.  That's true you're getting a hell of a reputation.
70769,m203,the godfather,L593391,u3112,SONNY,No more stalemate Tom we got the soldiers we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am Tom-- and they're scared of me.
70770,m203,the godfather,L593390,u3102,HAGEN,You start operating the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny your war is costing us a lot of money.
70771,m203,the godfather,L593389,u3112,SONNY,We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
70772,m203,the godfather,L593384,u3102,HAGEN,We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
70773,m203,the godfather,L593383,u3112,SONNY,Pop they hit us and we hit them back.
70774,m203,the godfather,L593331,u3112,SONNY,Can you do it Mike?
70775,m203,the godfather,L593330,u3102,HAGEN,Jesus I don't know...
70776,m203,the godfather,L593321,u3102,HAGEN,No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.
70777,m203,the godfather,L593320,u3112,SONNY,One of Tattaglia's people?
70778,m203,the godfather,L593299,u3112,SONNY,McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
70779,m203,the godfather,L593298,u3102,HAGEN,I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
70780,m203,the godfather,L593297,u3112,SONNY,No no no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
70781,m203,the godfather,L593296,u3102,HAGEN,Yes even the shooting of your father was business not personal...
70782,m203,the godfather,L593295,u3112,SONNY,And when they shot me father...
70783,m203,the godfather,L593294,u3102,HAGEN,Come ON Sonny your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing this is Business.
70784,m203,the godfather,L593293,u3112,SONNY,Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
70785,m203,the godfather,L593292,u3102,HAGEN,The other families won't sit still for all out war.
70786,m203,the godfather,L593291,u3112,SONNY,No no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings no more discussions no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
70787,m203,the godfather,L593290,u3102,HAGEN,We should hear what they have to say.
70788,m203,the godfather,L593289,u3112,SONNY,Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
70789,m203,the godfather,L593288,u3102,HAGEN,What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
70790,m203,the godfather,L593287,u3112,SONNY,Sure he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
70791,m203,the godfather,L593286,u3102,HAGEN,Was there a definite proposal?
70792,m203,the godfather,L593187,u3112,SONNY,OK forget it just stay on the phone.
70793,m203,the godfather,L593186,u3102,HAGEN,Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
70794,m203,the godfather,L593173,u3112,SONNY,OK we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead.  But Tom I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too Mike no chances.  Tessio you hold your people in reserve but have them nosing around the city.  The hospital is yours; I want it tight fool-proof 24 hours a day.
70795,m203,the godfather,L593172,u3102,HAGEN,We're all tired...
70796,m203,the godfather,L593171,u3112,SONNY,Oh Christ Tom I didn't mean it that way.
70797,m203,the godfather,L593170,u3102,HAGEN,I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
70798,m203,the godfather,L593169,u3112,SONNY,That's easy to say; it's not your father.
70799,m203,the godfather,L593168,u3102,HAGEN,Without your father's political contacts and personal influence the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal Sonny.
70800,m203,the godfather,L593167,u3112,SONNY,Tom you're the Consigliere what do we do if the old man dies?
70801,m203,the godfather,L593165,u3102,HAGEN,Luca never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he's through.  Mike keep ringing Luca's number.
70802,m203,the godfather,L593164,u3112,SONNY,No and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
70803,m203,the godfather,L593163,u3102,HAGEN,Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
70804,m203,the godfather,L593162,u3112,SONNY,If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
70805,m203,the godfather,L593161,u3102,HAGEN,What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.  That worries me.
70806,m203,the godfather,L593159,u3112,SONNY,The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
70807,m203,the godfather,L593158,u3102,HAGEN,Is the hospital covered?
70808,m203,the godfather,L592963,u3112,SONNY,Okay.  One minute.
70809,m203,the godfather,L592962,u3102,HAGEN,The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
70810,m203,the godfather,L593376,u3102,HAGEN,Mama no.
70811,m203,the godfather,L593375,u3104,KAY,Will you give this letter to Michael.
70812,m203,the godfather,L593371,u3102,HAGEN,If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay he'll contact you.
70813,m203,the godfather,L593370,u3104,KAY,Will you give this to him.
70814,m203,the godfather,L593368,u3104,KAY,Listen Tom I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one?
70815,m203,the godfather,L593367,u3102,HAGEN,An accident.  No one was hurt.
70816,m203,the godfather,L593366,u3104,KAY,What was that?
70817,m203,the godfather,L593365,u3102,HAGEN,Nobody knows where he is.  We know he's all right but that's all.
70818,m203,the godfather,L593364,u3104,KAY,I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
70819,m203,the godfather,L593363,u3102,HAGEN,Kay we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
70821,m203,the godfather,L593124,u3102,HAGEN,I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
70823,m203,the godfather,L593122,u3102,HAGEN,Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
70825,m203,the godfather,L593119,u3102,HAGEN,Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
70828,m203,the godfather,L593009,u3102,HAGEN,I'm German-Irish.
70830,m203,the godfather,L593007,u3102,HAGEN,He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
70832,m203,the godfather,L593005,u3102,HAGEN,Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close a very sacred religious relationship.
70833,m203,the godfather,L593684,u3105,MICHAEL,A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground where I'll be safe.
70834,m203,the godfather,L593683,u3102,HAGEN,Have you agreed on a meeting?
70835,m203,the godfather,L593682,u3105,MICHAEL,I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
70836,m203,the godfather,L593681,u3102,HAGEN,How will they come at you?
70837,m203,the godfather,L593680,u3105,MICHAEL,Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
70838,m203,the godfather,L593679,u3102,HAGEN,Did he give you his politicians?
70839,m203,the godfather,L593678,u3105,MICHAEL,Christ Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
70840,m203,the godfather,L593649,u3102,HAGEN,OK but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf and if he tears you apart the other families won't come running to help the Corleones...
70841,m203,the godfather,L593648,u3105,MICHAEL,You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
70842,m203,the godfather,L593647,u3102,HAGEN,Mike why am I out?
70843,m203,the godfather,L593646,u3105,MICHAEL,Not so perfectly if you noticed.
70844,m203,the godfather,L593645,u3102,HAGEN,Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
70845,m203,the godfather,L593642,u3102,HAGEN,I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime.  Why does Neri report directly to you rather than through me or a caporegime?
70846,m203,the godfather,L593641,u3105,MICHAEL,Tom we're going to be legitimate all the way and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
70847,m203,the godfather,L593640,u3102,HAGEN,Mike why are you cutting me out of the action?
70848,m203,the godfather,L593303,u3105,MICHAEL,Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
70849,m203,the godfather,L593302,u3102,HAGEN,What about McCluskey?
70850,m203,the godfather,L593049,u3102,HAGEN,Right.
70851,m203,the godfather,L593048,u3105,MICHAEL,No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach right?
70852,m203,the godfather,L593047,u3102,HAGEN,Sure.  Anything I can do for you.
70853,m203,the godfather,L592929,u3105,MICHAEL,Thanks Tom.
70854,m203,the godfather,L592928,u3102,HAGEN,Hello Kay.  Your father's inside doing some business.  He's been asking for you.
70855,m203,the godfather,L593747,u3104,KAY,Is it true?
70856,m203,the godfather,L593746,u3105,MICHAEL,All right this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs one last time.
70857,m203,the godfather,L593745,u3104,KAY,Tell me!
70858,m203,the godfather,L593744,u3105,MICHAEL,Don't ask me.
70859,m203,the godfather,L593743,u3104,KAY,Michael it's not true.  Please tell me.
70860,m203,the godfather,L593614,u3105,MICHAEL,Let me think about it O.K.?
70861,m203,the godfather,L593613,u3104,KAY,Will you?
70862,m203,the godfather,L593612,u3104,KAY,Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy.
70863,m203,the godfather,L593611,u3105,MICHAEL,I'm busy.
70864,m203,the godfather,L593610,u3104,KAY,Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now but you never get close to them.
70865,m203,the godfather,L593608,u3105,MICHAEL,Let HER ask.
70866,m203,the godfather,L593607,u3104,KAY,Your sister wants to ask you something.
70867,m203,the godfather,L593606,u3104,KAY,Wake me up when you come to bed?
70868,m203,the godfather,L593605,u3105,MICHAEL,No you eat...don't wait up for me.
70869,m203,the godfather,L593604,u3104,KAY,Don't you want dinner first?
70870,m203,the godfather,L593603,u3105,MICHAEL,We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
70871,m203,the godfather,L593602,u3104,KAY,Oh Michael.
70872,m203,the godfather,L593601,u3105,MICHAEL,I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
70873,m203,the godfather,L593244,u3105,MICHAEL,Goodbye.
70874,m203,the godfather,L593243,u3104,KAY,When will I see you again?
70875,m203,the godfather,L593242,u3105,MICHAEL,I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over.
70876,m203,the godfather,L593241,u3104,KAY,When will I see you again?
70877,m203,the godfather,L593240,u3105,MICHAEL,I don't think so either.  I better go.
70878,m203,the godfather,L593239,u3104,KAY,My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
70879,m203,the godfather,L593238,u3105,MICHAEL,I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
70880,m203,the godfather,L593237,u3104,KAY,Can I go to the hospital with you?
70881,m203,the godfather,L593236,u3105,MICHAEL,Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
70882,m203,the godfather,L593226,u3104,KAY,OK. 
70883,m203,the godfather,L593225,u3105,MICHAEL,Look.  I'll see you tonight OK?
70884,m203,the godfather,L593224,u3104,KAY,Please say it.
70885,m203,the godfather,L593223,u3105,MICHAEL,I can't...
70886,m203,the godfather,L593222,u3104,KAY,Tell me you love me.
70887,m203,the godfather,L593221,u3105,MICHAEL,Huh?
70888,m203,the godfather,L593220,u3104,KAY,Can you say it?
70889,m203,the godfather,L593219,u3105,MICHAEL,Yeah Kay I'm here.

70897,m203,the godfather,L593065,u3105,MICHAEL,I'm thinking about it.
70898,m203,the godfather,L593064,u3104,KAY,Michael?

70908,m203,the godfather,L593038,u3104,KAY,What time do they expect us?
70909,m203,the godfather,L593037,u3105,MICHAEL,As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt but he won't object.
70910,m203,the godfather,L593036,u3104,KAY,What will your father say?
70911,m203,the godfather,L593034,u3104,KAY,Just you.

70914,m203,the godfather,L592953,u3105,MICHAEL,He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
70915,m203,the godfather,L592952,u3104,KAY,I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
70916,m203,the godfather,L592951,u3105,MICHAEL,Sure.
70917,m203,the godfather,L592950,u3104,KAY,I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
70918,m203,the godfather,L592931,u3105,MICHAEL,My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
70919,m203,the godfather,L592930,u3104,KAY,If he's your brother why does he have a different name?
70920,m203,the godfather,L592927,u3105,MICHAEL,My brother Tom Hagen.
70921,m203,the godfather,L592926,u3104,KAY,How do you do.
70922,m203,the godfather,L592925,u3105,MICHAEL,Tom...Tom I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
70923,m203,the godfather,L592924,u3104,KAY,He's coming over here!
70924,m203,the godfather,L592923,u3105,MICHAEL,I told you you wouldn't like him.
70925,m203,the godfather,L592922,u3104,KAY,I never know when you're telling me the truth.
70926,m203,the godfather,L592921,u3105,MICHAEL,...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.
70927,m203,the godfather,L592920,u3104,KAY,Michael I love you.
70928,m203,the godfather,L592919,u3105,MICHAEL,Then Luca turned to the other man...
70929,m203,the godfather,L592918,u3104,KAY,Michael I don't want to hear anymore...
70930,m203,the godfather,L592917,u3105,MICHAEL,Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
70931,m203,the godfather,L592916,u3104,KAY,Michael you're trying to scare me...
70932,m203,the godfather,L592915,u3105,MICHAEL,Then the legs at the knees...
70933,m203,the godfather,L592914,u3104,KAY,Michael...
70934,m203,the godfather,L592913,u3105,MICHAEL,My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax and chopped one man's feet off...
70935,m203,the godfather,L592912,u3104,KAY,Al Capone!
70936,m203,the godfather,L592911,u3105,MICHAEL,Once upon a time about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father and they almost did.
70937,m203,the godfather,L592910,u3105,MICHAEL,Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.
70938,m203,the godfather,L592909,u3104,KAY,You know I love spaghetti.
70939,m203,the godfather,L592908,u3105,MICHAEL,You like spaghetti?
70940,m203,the godfather,L592907,u3104,KAY,Yes.  Tell me.
70941,m203,the godfather,L592906,u3105,MICHAEL,You really want to know?
70942,m203,the godfather,L592905,u3104,KAY,Who is he?
70943,m203,the godfather,L592904,u3105,MICHAEL,No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him.
70944,m203,the godfather,L592898,u3105,MICHAEL,Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
70945,m203,the godfather,L592897,u3104,KAY,Why do they bother him on a day like this?
70946,m203,the godfather,L592896,u3105,MICHAEL,They're going to talk to my father which means they're going to ask him for something which means they better get it right.
70947,m203,the godfather,L592895,u3104,KAY,They're talking to themselves.
70948,m203,the godfather,L592894,u3105,MICHAEL,They're waiting to see my father.

70950,m203,the godfather,L592892,u3105,MICHAEL,I told you I had a lot of relatives.
70951,m203,the godfather,L592891,u3104,KAY,I've never seen anything like it.
70953,m203,the godfather,L593258,u3105,MICHAEL,You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
70955,m203,the godfather,L593256,u3105,MICHAEL,You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
70957,m203,the godfather,L593251,u3105,MICHAEL,You just stand here one minute...
70959,m203,the godfather,L593249,u3105,MICHAEL,I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
70960,m203,the godfather,L593329,u3112,SONNY,Probably a year...
70961,m203,the godfather,L593328,u3105,MICHAEL,O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
70962,m203,the godfather,L593316,u3112,SONNY,Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square under the big Camels sign.
70963,m203,the godfather,L593315,u3105,MICHAEL,A million times.
70964,m203,the godfather,L593314,u3112,SONNY,What are you inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
70965,m203,the godfather,L593313,u3105,MICHAEL,Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
70966,m203,the godfather,L593305,u3105,MICHAEL,They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza figure out a way to have one planted there for me.  Then I'll kill them both.
70967,m203,the godfather,L593304,u3112,SONNY,Go on Mike.
70968,m203,the godfather,L593301,u3112,SONNY,The kid's right.
70969,m203,the godfather,L593300,u3105,MICHAEL,We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
70970,m203,the godfather,L593285,u3112,SONNY,The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
70971,m203,the godfather,L593284,u3105,MICHAEL,Cut it out.
70972,m203,the godfather,L593283,u3112,SONNY,Mikey you look beautiful!
70973,m203,the godfather,L593254,u3105,MICHAEL,I won't panic.
70974,m203,the godfather,L593253,u3112,SONNY,All right get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight and don't panic.
70975,m203,the godfather,L593252,u3105,MICHAEL,Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.
70976,m203,the godfather,L593233,u3105,MICHAEL,I don't need them Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also I got other things.
70977,m203,the godfather,L593232,u3112,SONNY,Send some bodyguards.
70978,m203,the godfather,L593231,u3105,MICHAEL,To the city.
70979,m203,the godfather,L593230,u3112,SONNY,Where are you going?
70980,m203,the godfather,L593156,u3105,MICHAEL,Is it like they say?  Is he that good?
70981,m203,the godfather,L593155,u3112,SONNY,Christ if I could only contact Luca.
70982,m203,the godfather,L593154,u3105,MICHAEL,All right Sonny.  All right.
70983,m203,the godfather,L593153,u3112,SONNY,I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action I can operate as good as anybody short range.
70984,m203,the godfather,L593152,u3105,MICHAEL,That's not how Pop would have played it.
70985,m203,the godfather,L593151,u3112,SONNY,Sollozzo is a dead man I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
70986,m203,the godfather,L593150,u3105,MICHAEL,Then wait Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
70987,m203,the godfather,L593149,u3112,SONNY,Until the old man tells me different.
70988,m203,the godfather,L593148,u3105,MICHAEL,Is it going to be all-out war like last time?
70989,m203,the godfather,L593147,u3112,SONNY,On the three days Paulie was sick this month he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
70990,m203,the godfather,L593146,u3105,MICHAEL,How can you be sure?
70991,m203,the godfather,L593145,u3112,SONNY,You're right kid Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
70992,m203,the godfather,L593144,u3105,MICHAEL,Clemenza?  No I don't believe it.
70993,m203,the godfather,L593143,u3112,SONNY,One of them fingered the old man.
70994,m203,the godfather,L593142,u3105,MICHAEL,What?
70995,m203,the godfather,L593141,u3112,SONNY,All right Mikey...who do we have to hit Clemenza or Paulie?
70996,m203,the godfather,L593140,u3112,SONNY,Theresa.

76279,m217,there's something about mary,L600442,u3283,TED,No prob I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
76281,m217,there's something about mary,L600194,u3277,MARY,I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
76283,m217,there's something about mary,L600190,u3277,MARY,Ah she's okay.
76285,m217,there's something about mary,L600188,u3277,MARY,I don't know it was complicated. He's in San Francisco I'm in Miami.  Besides Magda's psychic dog hated him.
76287,m217,there's something about mary,L600185,u3277,MARY,Yeah Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
76289,m217,there's something about mary,L600183,u3277,MARY,No I'm not.
76291,m217,there's something about mary,L600181,u3277,MARY,What's that supposed to mean?
76293,m217,there's something about mary,L600173,u3277,MARY,But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
76295,m217,there's something about mary,L600171,u3277,MARY,I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
76297,m217,there's something about mary,L600166,u3277,MARY,Ugh not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
76300,m217,there's something about mary,L600831,u3277,MARY,Where's Puffy?
76303,m217,there's something about mary,L600702,u3277,MARY,Magda!
76305,m217,there's something about mary,L600700,u3277,MARY,Holy shit...
76306,m217,there's something about mary,L600684,u3277,MARY,I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.

76311,m217,there's something about mary,L600671,u3277,MARY,Love? Come on I wouldn't call it love.
76313,m217,there's something about mary,L600669,u3277,MARY,So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
76315,m217,there's something about mary,L600667,u3277,MARY,Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
76317,m217,there's something about mary,L600665,u3277,MARY,Why?

76326,m217,there's something about mary,L600370,u3277,MARY,The point is love isn't about money or social standing or age it's about connecting with someone having things in common kindred spirits.
76328,m217,there's something about mary,L600368,u3277,MARY,This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
76330,m217,there's something about mary,L600366,u3277,MARY,Come on Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
76332,m217,there's something about mary,L600364,u3277,MARY,You know a mookalone a schlep.
76334,m217,there's something about mary,L600362,u3277,MARY,I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
76336,m217,there's something about mary,L600360,u3277,MARY,He's no Steve Young.
76338,m217,there's something about mary,L600358,u3277,MARY,Name's Patrick I met him at the driving range.
76340,m217,there's something about mary,L600205,u3277,MARY,No time Magda my show's starting.

76350,m217,there's something about mary,L600142,u3277,MARY,Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
76352,m217,there's something about mary,L600140,u3277,MARY,Have you been up all night again?
76353,m217,there's something about mary,L600946,u3277,MARY,Oh Jesus...
76354,m217,there's something about mary,L600945,u3284,TUCKER,Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
76355,m217,there's something about mary,L600942,u3277,MARY,You mean he's not a criminal?
76356,m217,there's something about mary,L600941,u3284,TUCKER,Uh well... not exactly. You see I exaggerated a little there.
76357,m217,there's something about mary,L600709,u3277,MARY,Yeah yeah. Okay I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
76358,m217,there's something about mary,L600708,u3284,TUCKER,Don't get all gooey on me now you'll give me a big head.  The important thing Doctor is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
76359,m217,there's something about mary,L600707,u3277,MARY,Magda's right I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
76360,m217,there's something about mary,L600705,u3284,TUCKER,Okay just calm down. It's going to be okay.
76361,m217,there's something about mary,L600704,u3277,MARY,I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
76362,m217,there's something about mary,L600699,u3284,TUCKER,I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when despite a grim psychological profile the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him and on and on and so forth and so on.
76363,m217,there's something about mary,L600698,u3277,MARY,What...?
76364,m217,there's something about mary,L600697,u3284,TUCKER,Mary the man's a killer.
76365,m217,there's something about mary,L600696,u3277,MARY,Tucker I appreciate you doing all this but I'm really strapped for time here and --
76366,m217,there's something about mary,L600695,u3284,TUCKER,I think you'd better sit down.
76367,m217,there's something about mary,L600693,u3284,TUCKER,Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
76368,m217,there's something about mary,L600692,u3277,MARY,What's up?
76369,m217,there's something about mary,L600691,u3284,TUCKER,Thanks but I've got to be going. Unfortunately Doc this isn't a social visit.
76370,m217,there's something about mary,L600690,u3277,MARY,Can I pour you one?
76371,m217,there's something about mary,L600549,u3277,MARY,I appreciate you looking out for me.
76372,m217,there's something about mary,L600548,u3284,TUCKER,I mean let's face it Mary you're beautiful you've got money you trust people -- I'm just saying there's a lot of psychos out there.
76373,m217,there's something about mary,L600547,u3277,MARY,No no no Tucker thank you.
76374,m217,there's something about mary,L600546,u3284,TUCKER,I thought so. Anyway I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
76375,m217,there's something about mary,L600543,u3284,TUCKER,Look it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
76376,m217,there's something about mary,L600542,u3277,MARY,I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
76377,m217,there's something about mary,L600541,u3284,TUCKER,That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
76378,m217,there's something about mary,L600540,u3277,MARY,Not long at all but I really like him.  Okay I know he's a little different Tucker but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts too. And that's okay with me.
76379,m217,there's something about mary,L600539,u3284,TUCKER,Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
76380,m217,there's something about mary,L600538,u3277,MARY,He's a nice guy isn't he?
76381,m217,there's something about mary,L600534,u3277,MARY,No no the bigger the better.  But I must say they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
76382,m217,there's something about mary,L600533,u3284,TUCKER,You don't think they're too big?
76383,m217,there's something about mary,L600530,u3277,MARY,Tucker you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
76384,m217,there's something about mary,L600529,u3284,TUCKER,What's up Doc?
76385,m217,there's something about mary,L600427,u3284,TUCKER,Where would I have seen your work?
76386,m217,there's something about mary,L600426,u3277,MARY,Pat does projects all over the world.
76387,m217,there's something about mary,L600412,u3284,TUCKER,Hey no kidding? Where are your offices?
76388,m217,there's something about mary,L600411,u3277,MARY,Pat's an architect too.
76389,m217,there's something about mary,L600979,u3277,MARY,Really.
76390,m217,there's something about mary,L600978,u3283,TED,Really?
76391,m217,there's something about mary,L600977,u3277,MARY,Get over here.
76392,m217,there's something about mary,L600976,u3277,MARY,Oh yeah that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
76393,m217,there's something about mary,L600975,u3283,TED,But but what about Steve?
76394,m217,there's something about mary,L600973,u3277,MARY,But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
76395,m217,there's something about mary,L600972,u3283,TED,I... I just want you to be happy Mary.
76396,m217,there's something about mary,L600971,u3277,MARY,Ted...?
76397,m217,there's something about mary,L600968,u3277,MARY,You forgot your keys!
76398,m217,there's something about mary,L600967,u3283,TED,What what are you doing here?
76399,m217,there's something about mary,L600934,u3283,TED,You're Woogie?
76400,m217,there's something about mary,L600933,u3277,MARY,Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
76401,m217,there's something about mary,L600856,u3283,TED,Okay.
76402,m217,there's something about mary,L600855,u3277,MARY,Go!
76403,m217,there's something about mary,L600854,u3283,TED,Mary come on...
76404,m217,there's something about mary,L600853,u3277,MARY,Please leave.
76405,m217,there's something about mary,L600852,u3283,TED,I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.
76406,m217,there's something about mary,L600851,u3277,MARY,Then what the fuck did you do it for?
76407,m217,there's something about mary,L600850,u3283,TED,Mary I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
76408,m217,there's something about mary,L600849,u3277,MARY,What did you think Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?
76409,m217,there's something about mary,L600848,u3283,TED,Well yeah I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
76410,m217,there's something about mary,L600847,u3277,MARY,That you put a murderer on my trail?
76411,m217,there's something about mary,L600846,u3283,TED,Wait hold on Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
76412,m217,there's something about mary,L600845,u3277,MARY,Get out.
76413,m217,there's something about mary,L600836,u3277,MARY,Toy poodle!
76414,m217,there's something about mary,L600835,u3283,TED,Uh Mare what kind of dog is Puffy?
76415,m217,there's something about mary,L600834,u3283,TED,Yeah sure.
76416,m217,there's something about mary,L600833,u3277,MARY,Um Ted I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
76417,m217,there's something about mary,L600828,u3283,TED,All right let's go.
76418,m217,there's something about mary,L600827,u3277,MARY,That's really sweet Ted but you should save it for one of your books.
76419,m217,there's something about mary,L600826,u3283,TED,Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.
76420,m217,there's something about mary,L600825,u3277,MARY,Why not?
76421,m217,there's something about mary,L600824,u3283,TED,Look Mary the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
76422,m217,there's something about mary,L600823,u3277,MARY,Ted... you're not that far ahead.
76423,m217,there's something about mary,L600822,u3283,TED,Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
76424,m217,there's something about mary,L600821,u3277,MARY,Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?

76426,m217,there's something about mary,L600819,u3277,MARY,...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
76427,m217,there's something about mary,L600812,u3277,MARY,I don't know... My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I did come close once -- just last year in fact. There was this guy he lived in San Francisco.
76428,m217,there's something about mary,L600811,u3283,TED,What about you Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
76429,m217,there's something about mary,L600810,u3277,MARY,That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
76430,m217,there's something about mary,L600809,u3283,TED,We'll see. If it doesn't what the hell at least I gave it a shot.

76443,m217,there's something about mary,L600796,u3283,TED,I say they should put more meats on a stick you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles fudgesicles lollipops -- but hardly any meat.

82911,m235,a hard day's night,L15584,u3568,GRANDFATHER,That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.

82915,m235,a hard day's night,L15580,u3568,GRANDFATHER,That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son I'll be back for you.

82927,m235,a hard day's night,L15338,u3568,GRANDFATHER,When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.

82934,m235,a hard day's night,L15331,u3574,RINGO,Oh ... I dunno.
82935,m235,a hard day's night,L15330,u3568,GRANDFATHER,Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff they've driven you into books by their cruel unnatural treatment exploiting your good nature.

82952,m235,a hard day's night,L15313,u3574,RINGO,Well ... what's the matter with that?
82953,m235,a hard day's night,L15312,u3568,GRANDFATHER,Will you ever look at him sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
82954,m235,a hard day's night,L15014,u3568,GRANDFATHER,Quite right invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar disgusting!

82967,m235,a hard day's night,L15647,u3569,JOHN,You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
82968,m235,a hard day's night,L15079,u3568,GRANDFATHER,Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ...

82986,m235,a hard day's night,L14994,u3572,PAUL,Oh for Pete's sake It's only a joke.

83192,m235,a hard day's night,L15207,u3571,NORM,What?
83194,m235,a hard day's night,L15205,u3571,NORM,Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
83196,m235,a hard day's night,L15203,u3571,NORM,He's out there somewhere causing trouble just to upset me.
83197,m235,a hard day's night,L15202,u3571,NORM,That's too easy for Lennon.

83207,m235,a hard day's night,L14857,u3571,NORM,Well you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ... 
83210,m235,a hard day's night,L14852,u3571,NORM,Well you stick to that story son.
83212,m235,a hard day's night,L14850,u3571,NORM,Yeah you want to watch it.
83213,m235,a hard day's night,L15349,u3574,RINGO,Get knotted!
83214,m235,a hard day's night,L15348,u3572,PAUL,Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
83215,m235,a hard day's night,L15252,u3574,RINGO,You were twanging too loud.
83216,m235,a hard day's night,L15251,u3572,PAUL,What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.
83217,m235,a hard day's night,L15062,u3572,PAUL,Yeah It's all your fault getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
83218,m235,a hard day's night,L15061,u3574,RINGO,Oh he's gone to my club has he?
83219,m235,a hard day's night,L15010,u3574,RINGO,And they want me?
83220,m235,a hard day's night,L14791,u3574,RINGO,Well ... if he's your Grandfather who knows?
83221,m235,a hard day's night,L14790,u3572,PAUL,Course he can talk. He's a human being like. Isn't he?
83222,m235,a hard day's night,L14776,u3572,PAUL,Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
83223,m235,a hard day's night,L14775,u3574,RINGO,How's that?
83225,m235,a hard day's night,L15244,u3572,PAUL,I'll set John on you!
83227,m235,a hard day's night,L15242,u3572,PAUL,Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him will you?
83228,m235,a hard day's night,L15056,u3572,PAUL,Oh him... He's been lurking.
83231,m235,a hard day's night,L14916,u3572,PAUL,You can't trust you with anything Norm if you've lost him I'll cripple you.
83873,m238,all about eve,L29036,u3599,ADDISON,Why not? Tell me Phoebe do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?
83875,m238,all about eve,L29034,u3599,ADDISON,Phoebe?

83879,m238,all about eve,L29030,u3599,ADDISON,How do you know my name?
83880,m238,all about eve,L29029,u3599,ADDISON,We won't disturb her rest. It seems she left her award in the taxicab. Will you give it to her?
83882,m238,all about eve,L29027,u3599,ADDISON,Hello there. Who are you?
83883,m238,all about eve,L28993,u3599,ADDISON,Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
83884,m238,all about eve,L28992,u3602,EVE,I'm tired. I want to go home.
83885,m238,all about eve,L28991,u3599,ADDISON,You're being childish.
83886,m238,all about eve,L28990,u3602,EVE,Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
83887,m238,all about eve,L28989,u3599,ADDISON,It's the same thing isn't it?
83888,m238,all about eve,L28988,u3602,EVE,No it's not.  It's for this.
83889,m238,all about eve,L28987,u3599,ADDISON,Max has gone to a great deal of trouble it's going to be an elaborate party and it's for you.
83890,m238,all about eve,L28986,u3602,EVE,Because I don't want to.
83891,m238,all about eve,L28985,u3599,ADDISON,Why not?
83892,m238,all about eve,L28984,u3602,EVE,I don't think I'm going.
83893,m238,all about eve,L28983,u3599,ADDISON,You can have one at Max's.
83894,m238,all about eve,L28982,u3602,EVE,I don't suppose there's a drink left...
83895,m238,all about eve,L28962,u3599,ADDISON,Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
83896,m238,all about eve,L28961,u3602,EVE,I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
83897,m238,all about eve,L28960,u3599,ADDISON,Take your nap now. And good luck for tonight.
83898,m238,all about eve,L28959,u3602,EVE,Yes Addison.
83899,m238,all about eve,L28958,u3599,ADDISON,And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
83900,m238,all about eve,L28957,u3602,EVE,Yes Addison.
83901,m238,all about eve,L28956,u3599,ADDISON,Then say so.
83902,m238,all about eve,L28953,u3599,ADDISON,I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago. As always with women who want to find out things she told more than she learned...  ... do you want to change your story about Lloyd beating at your door the other night?
83903,m238,all about eve,L28952,u3602,EVE,No-no-no...
83904,m238,all about eve,L28950,u3599,ADDISON,I was there I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
83905,m238,all about eve,L28949,u3602,EVE,That's not true!
83906,m238,all about eve,L28948,u3599,ADDISON,She did like you she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
83907,m238,all about eve,L28947,u3602,EVE,I had to get in to meet Margo! I had to say something be somebody make her like me!
83908,m238,all about eve,L28945,u3599,ADDISON,Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
83909,m238,all about eve,L28944,u3602,EVE,She was a liar she was a liar!
83910,m238,all about eve,L28942,u3599,ADDISON,But the $500 you got to get out of town brought you straight to New York - didn't it?
83911,m238,all about eve,L28941,u3602,EVE,She never proved anything not a thing!
83912,m238,all about eve,L28940,u3599,ADDISON,A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
83913,m238,all about eve,L28939,u3602,EVE,What of it?
83914,m238,all about eve,L28938,u3599,ADDISON,It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
83915,m238,all about eve,L28937,u3602,EVE,What of it?
83916,m238,all about eve,L28936,u3599,ADDISON,Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
83917,m238,all about eve,L28933,u3602,EVE,Then if you won't get out I'll have you thrown out.
83918,m238,all about eve,L28932,u3599,ADDISON,You're too short for that gesture. Besides it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
83919,m238,all about eve,L28929,u3602,EVE,... taken it for granted? That you and I...
83920,m238,all about eve,L28928,u3599,ADDISON,So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this frankly I had hoped that you would somehow have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
83921,m238,all about eve,L28927,u3602,EVE,Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
83922,m238,all about eve,L28926,u3599,ADDISON,A dull cliche.
83923,m238,all about eve,L28925,u3602,EVE,I can't believe my ears...
83924,m238,all about eve,L28924,u3599,ADDISON,Everything. Because after tonight you will belong to me.
83925,m238,all about eve,L28923,u3602,EVE,What have you got to do with it?
83926,m238,all about eve,L28922,u3599,ADDISON,More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play discuss your dreams or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
83927,m238,all about eve,L28921,u3602,EVE,What do you mean by that?
83928,m238,all about eve,L28920,u3599,ADDISON,Very well plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen but he will not leave Karen for you.
83929,m238,all about eve,L28919,u3602,EVE,Addison will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
83930,m238,all about eve,L28918,u3599,ADDISON,Not with me you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
83931,m238,all about eve,L28917,u3602,EVE,Champion to champion.
83932,m238,all about eve,L28916,u3599,ADDISON,- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
83933,m238,all about eve,L28915,u3602,EVE,I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-
83934,m238,all about eve,L28914,u3599,ADDISON,Yes you did. You still do.
83935,m238,all about eve,L28913,u3602,EVE,I never intended you to be.
83936,m238,all about eve,L28912,u3599,ADDISON,Look closely Eve it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
83937,m238,all about eve,L28911,u3602,EVE,I'm sure you mean something by that Addison but I don't know what...
83938,m238,all about eve,L28910,u3599,ADDISON,It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
83939,m238,all about eve,L28909,u3602,EVE,I don't know what I take you for anything...
83940,m238,all about eve,L28908,u3599,ADDISON,What do you take me for?
83941,m238,all about eve,L28907,u3602,EVE,Well say something - anything! Congratulations skol - good work Eve!
83942,m238,all about eve,L28906,u3599,ADDISON,There never was there'll never be another like you.
83943,m238,all about eve,L28905,u3602,EVE,We sat and talked Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
83944,m238,all about eve,L28904,u3599,ADDISON,You sat and talked until it was light...
83945,m238,all about eve,L28903,u3602,EVE,The setting wasn't romantic but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning banging on my door - he couldn't sleep he told me - he's left Karen he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
83946,m238,all about eve,L28902,u3599,ADDISON,Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers gypsy violins off stage?
83947,m238,all about eve,L28901,u3602,EVE,We decided the night before last before we came up here...
83948,m238,all about eve,L28900,u3599,ADDISON,I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
83949,m238,all about eve,L28897,u3602,EVE,She doesn't know.
83950,m238,all about eve,L28896,u3599,ADDISON,... and Karen.
83951,m238,all about eve,L28895,u3602,EVE,Addison won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me I'll make them be great!  You're the only one I've told the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...
83952,m238,all about eve,L28894,u3599,ADDISON,- and artistically the most promising! Eve dear this is Addison.
83953,m238,all about eve,L28893,u3602,EVE,You have no right to say such things!
83954,m238,all about eve,L28892,u3599,ADDISON,Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
83955,m238,all about eve,L28891,u3602,EVE,I'm in love with Lloyd!
83956,m238,all about eve,L28890,u3599,ADDISON,I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
83957,m238,all about eve,L28889,u3602,EVE,It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me I love him!
83958,m238,all about eve,L28888,u3599,ADDISON,So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater after all...
83959,m238,all about eve,L28886,u3599,ADDISON,What else?
83960,m238,all about eve,L28885,u3602,EVE,I didn't mean just the Theater.
83961,m238,all about eve,L28884,u3599,ADDISON,- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
83962,m238,all about eve,L28883,u3602,EVE,Addison just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
83963,m238,all about eve,L28882,u3599,ADDISON,She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
83964,m238,all about eve,L28881,u3602,EVE,Addison...
83965,m238,all about eve,L28879,u3602,EVE,Lloyd and I.
83966,m238,all about eve,L28878,u3599,ADDISON,We're?
83967,m238,all about eve,L28877,u3602,EVE,That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
83968,m238,all about eve,L28876,u3599,ADDISON,Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
83969,m238,all about eve,L28875,u3602,EVE,Lloyd. I never have any and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
83970,m238,all about eve,L28874,u3599,ADDISON,Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian.
83971,m238,all about eve,L28873,u3602,EVE,Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
83972,m238,all about eve,L28872,u3599,ADDISON,Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
83973,m238,all about eve,L28870,u3599,ADDISON,Did I say killer? I meant champion. I get my boxing terms mixed.
83974,m238,all about eve,L28869,u3602,EVE,Why'd call me a killer?
83975,m238,all about eve,L28868,u3599,ADDISON,The mark of a true killer.  Sleep tight rest easy - and come out fighting...
83976,m238,all about eve,L28867,u3602,EVE,Why not?
83977,m238,all about eve,L28866,u3599,ADDISON,You could sleep too couldn't you?
83978,m238,all about eve,L28865,u3602,EVE,Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
83979,m238,all about eve,L28864,u3599,ADDISON,Almost four.
83980,m238,all about eve,L28863,u3602,EVE,What time?
83981,m238,all about eve,L28862,u3602,EVE,Stars.
83982,m238,all about eve,L28861,u3599,ADDISON,Paved with what then?
83983,m238,all about eve,L28860,u3602,EVE,You know me better than that.
83984,m238,all about eve,L28859,u3599,ADDISON,All paved with diamonds and gold?
83985,m238,all about eve,L28858,u3602,EVE,It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
83986,m238,all about eve,L28857,u3599,ADDISON,Frankly - yes.
83987,m238,all about eve,L28856,u3602,EVE,Aren't you?
83988,m238,all about eve,L28855,u3599,ADDISON,Are you that sure of tomorrow?
83989,m238,all about eve,L28854,u3602,EVE,Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken want to run away or something. Instead I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
83990,m238,all about eve,L28853,u3599,ADDISON,And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
83991,m238,all about eve,L28852,u3602,EVE,Just like it.
83992,m238,all about eve,L28851,u3599,ADDISON,D-day.
83993,m238,all about eve,L28850,u3602,EVE,What a day - what a heavenly day...
83994,m238,all about eve,L28784,u3599,ADDISON,I hope you mean what you say Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
83995,m238,all about eve,L28783,u3602,EVE,I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
83996,m238,all about eve,L28782,u3599,ADDISON,It wasn't meant to be.
83997,m238,all about eve,L28781,u3602,EVE,I don't think that's funny.
83998,m238,all about eve,L28780,u3599,ADDISON,Do you know Eve - sometimes I think you keep things from me.
83999,m238,all about eve,L28779,u3602,EVE,Just like that.
84000,m238,all about eve,L28778,u3599,ADDISON,Just like that eh?
84001,m238,all about eve,L28777,u3602,EVE,Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
84002,m238,all about eve,L28776,u3599,ADDISON,She mentioned of course that Margo expects to play the part?
84003,m238,all about eve,L28775,u3602,EVE,I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
84004,m238,all about eve,L28773,u3602,EVE,Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
84005,m238,all about eve,L28772,u3599,ADDISON,I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
84006,m238,all about eve,L28771,u3602,EVE,Just some coffee.
84007,m238,all about eve,L28770,u3599,ADDISON,Hungry?
84008,m238,all about eve,L28602,u3599,ADDISON,I believe I will.
84009,m238,all about eve,L28601,u3602,EVE,You take charge.
84010,m238,all about eve,L28600,u3599,ADDISON,I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
84011,m238,all about eve,L28599,u3602,EVE,I'm about to go into the shower I won't be able to hear you...
84012,m238,all about eve,L28598,u3599,ADDISON,Eddie what?
84013,m238,all about eve,L28597,u3602,EVE,Eddie...
84014,m238,all about eve,L28596,u3599,ADDISON,A fine old theater the Shubert. Full of tradition untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way what was your husband's name?
84015,m238,all about eve,L28595,u3602,EVE,Yes. The Shubert.
84016,m238,all about eve,L28594,u3599,ADDISON,And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
84017,m238,all about eve,L28593,u3602,EVE,Yes. I do.
84018,m238,all about eve,L28592,u3599,ADDISON,San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
84019,m238,all about eve,L28591,u3602,EVE,That's right.
84020,m238,all about eve,L28590,u3599,ADDISON,- perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin your tragic marriage your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco didn't it?  I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco didn't it?
84021,m238,all about eve,L28589,u3602,EVE,I'm not enough for a paragraph.
84022,m238,all about eve,L28588,u3599,ADDISON,Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
84023,m238,all about eve,L28587,u3602,EVE,I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
84024,m238,all about eve,L28586,u3599,ADDISON,After you change if you're not busy elsewhere we can have supper.
84025,m238,all about eve,L28583,u3599,ADDISON,I am somebody.
84026,m238,all about eve,L28582,u3602,EVE,Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
84027,m238,all about eve,L28581,u3599,ADDISON,It needn't be.
84028,m238,all about eve,L28580,u3602,EVE,Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
84029,m238,all about eve,L28579,u3599,ADDISON,We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
84030,m238,all about eve,L28578,u3602,EVE,I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
84031,m238,all about eve,L28577,u3599,ADDISON,I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
84032,m238,all about eve,L28576,u3602,EVE,Please do.
84033,m238,all about eve,L28575,u3599,ADDISON,A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However if I may a suggestion...
84034,m238,all about eve,L28574,u3602,EVE,It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
84035,m238,all about eve,L28573,u3599,ADDISON,You're more than modest.
84036,m238,all about eve,L28572,u3602,EVE,You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
84037,m238,all about eve,L28571,u3599,ADDISON,Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
84038,m238,all about eve,L28570,u3602,EVE,I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
84039,m238,all about eve,L28569,u3599,ADDISON,I expected to find this little room overcrowded with a theater full of people at your feet...
84040,m238,all about eve,L28568,u3602,EVE,Certainly Mr. deWitt...
84041,m238,all about eve,L28567,u3599,ADDISON,May I come in?
84042,m238,all about eve,L28338,u3599,ADDISON,That's all television is my dear. Nothing but auditions.
84044,m238,all about eve,L28336,u3599,ADDISON,You next move it seems to me should be toward television.
84046,m238,all about eve,L28334,u3599,ADDISON,Feeling better my dear?
84047,m238,all about eve,L28222,u3599,ADDISON,Because that is what they are. Go make him happy.
84049,m238,all about eve,L28220,u3599,ADDISON,Claudia dear come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
84051,m238,all about eve,L28211,u3599,ADDISON,This must be at long last our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
84052,m238,all about eve,L28208,u3599,ADDISON,Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
84054,m238,all about eve,L28118,u3599,ADDISON,You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
84057,m238,all about eve,L28069,u3599,ADDISON,You have a point. An idiotic one but a point.
84058,m238,all about eve,L28701,u3600,BILL,The point is - in the cathedral a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends.
84059,m238,all about eve,L28700,u3606,MARGO,Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown...
84060,m238,all about eve,L28697,u3606,MARGO,I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
84061,m238,all about eve,L28696,u3600,BILL,It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests things like that...
84062,m238,all about eve,L28688,u3606,MARGO,Glory Hallelujah.
84063,m238,all about eve,L28687,u3600,BILL,To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
84064,m238,all about eve,L28681,u3600,BILL,You were great.
84065,m238,all about eve,L28680,u3606,MARGO,He does not exaggerate. I was good.
84066,m238,all about eve,L28679,u3600,BILL,But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
84067,m238,all about eve,L28678,u3606,MARGO,Hear hear...
84068,m238,all about eve,L28677,u3600,BILL,The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...
84069,m238,all about eve,L28446,u3600,BILL,That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
84070,m238,all about eve,L28445,u3606,MARGO,Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?
84071,m238,all about eve,L28444,u3600,BILL,I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye Margo.
84072,m238,all about eve,L28443,u3606,MARGO,I - I don't know Bill. Just a feeling I don't know...
84073,m238,all about eve,L28442,u3600,BILL,You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo tell me what's behind all this.
84074,m238,all about eve,L28441,u3606,MARGO,I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
84075,m238,all about eve,L28440,u3600,BILL,Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
84076,m238,all about eve,L28439,u3606,MARGO,I wish it were.
84077,m238,all about eve,L28438,u3600,BILL,But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
84078,m238,all about eve,L28437,u3606,MARGO,It's not nonsense.
84079,m238,all about eve,L28436,u3600,BILL,Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
84080,m238,all about eve,L28435,u3606,MARGO,The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
84081,m238,all about eve,L28434,u3600,BILL,Margo let's make peace.
84082,m238,all about eve,L28433,u3606,MARGO,I admit I may have seen better days but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
84083,m238,all about eve,L28432,u3600,BILL,Come on get up. I'll buy you a drink.
84084,m238,all about eve,L28431,u3606,MARGO,Don't be condescending.
84085,m238,all about eve,L28430,u3600,BILL,I'll say.
84086,m238,all about eve,L28429,u3606,MARGO,Well I am.
84087,m238,all about eve,L28428,u3600,BILL,I've been aware of that for some time.
84088,m238,all about eve,L28427,u3606,MARGO,It's obvious you're not a woman.
84089,m238,all about eve,L28426,u3600,BILL,It's time you found out. I love you.  I love you. You're a beautiful and intelligent woman-  - a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress-  - at the peak of her career. You have every reason for happiness-  - every reason but due to some strange uncontrollable unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid-  - kid like Eve to turn you into a hysterical screaming harpy! Now once and for all stop it!
84090,m238,all about eve,L28425,u3606,MARGO,That word again! I don't even know what it means...
84091,m238,all about eve,L28424,u3600,BILL,No I'll tell it to you! For the last time I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself and me and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
84092,m238,all about eve,L28423,u3606,MARGO,Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with the rest of it...
84093,m238,all about eve,L28422,u3600,BILL,I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
84094,m238,all about eve,L28421,u3606,MARGO,Paranoiac!
84095,m238,all about eve,L28420,u3600,BILL,I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
84096,m238,all about eve,L28419,u3606,MARGO,The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt over and over full of those Bill Sampson touches!
84097,m238,all about eve,L28418,u3600,BILL,You've been all through that with Lloyd-
84098,m238,all about eve,L28417,u3606,MARGO,- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
84099,m238,all about eve,L28416,u3600,BILL,Now don't get carried away-
84100,m238,all about eve,L28415,u3606,MARGO,Such nonsense what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing carefully hidden no doubt-
84101,m238,all about eve,L28414,u3600,BILL,Here we go...
84102,m238,all about eve,L28413,u3606,MARGO,Well you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
84103,m238,all about eve,L28412,u3600,BILL,I'm trying terribly hard.
84104,m238,all about eve,L28411,u3606,MARGO,You're being terribly tolerant aren't you?
84105,m238,all about eve,L28410,u3600,BILL,Don't calm down.
84106,m238,all about eve,L28409,u3606,MARGO,I will not calm down!
84107,m238,all about eve,L28408,u3600,BILL,The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
84108,m238,all about eve,L28407,u3606,MARGO,The ex-ship news' reporter. No body no voice all mind!
84109,m238,all about eve,L28406,u3600,BILL,What a body what a voice.
84110,m238,all about eve,L28405,u3606,MARGO,I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
84111,m238,all about eve,L28404,u3600,BILL,Okay. Mix.
84112,m238,all about eve,L28403,u3606,MARGO,I mix what I like.

84114,m238,all about eve,L28401,u3606,MARGO,Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
84115,m238,all about eve,L28400,u3600,BILL,I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
84116,m238,all about eve,L28399,u3606,MARGO,I must have frightened her away.
84117,m238,all about eve,L28398,u3600,BILL,Gone.
84118,m238,all about eve,L28397,u3606,MARGO,The kid. Junior.

84120,m238,all about eve,L28395,u3606,MARGO,And you I take it are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
84121,m238,all about eve,L28370,u3606,MARGO,So full of meaning fire and music!
84122,m238,all about eve,L28369,u3600,BILL,Addison-!
84123,m238,all about eve,L28357,u3606,MARGO,You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?

84125,m238,all about eve,L28345,u3606,MARGO,Eve?  How enchanting...  Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
84126,m238,all about eve,L28344,u3600,BILL,The audition.
84127,m238,all about eve,L28343,u3606,MARGO,What's all over?
84128,m238,all about eve,L28342,u3600,BILL,It's all over.
84129,m238,all about eve,L28243,u3606,MARGO,Everybody has a heart - except some people.  Of course I've got bicarb. There's a box in the pantry. We'll put your name on it. Max Fabian. It'll say there. Always. Just for you.
84130,m238,all about eve,L28242,u3600,BILL,No heart to burn.
84131,m238,all about eve,L28239,u3606,MARGO,If my guests do not like it here I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
84132,m238,all about eve,L28238,u3600,BILL,Then without feeling your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say happier side?
84133,m238,all about eve,L28237,u3606,MARGO,You know nothing about feelings natural or unnatural.
84134,m238,all about eve,L28236,u3600,BILL,Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
84135,m238,all about eve,L28235,u3606,MARGO,It hasn't been laid out we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
84136,m238,all about eve,L28234,u3600,BILL,Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?
84137,m238,all about eve,L28195,u3600,BILL,I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...
84138,m238,all about eve,L28194,u3606,MARGO,The kid - junior that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...

84141,m238,all about eve,L28171,u3606,MARGO,Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
84142,m238,all about eve,L28170,u3600,BILL,She hasn't cut them yet and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word look thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
84143,m238,all about eve,L28169,u3606,MARGO,What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
84144,m238,all about eve,L28168,u3600,BILL,Mad! Darling there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
84145,m238,all about eve,L28167,u3606,MARGO,- guilty.
84146,m238,all about eve,L28166,u3600,BILL,This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
84147,m238,all about eve,L28165,u3606,MARGO,For instance - you!
84148,m238,all about eve,L28164,u3600,BILL,For instance what?
84149,m238,all about eve,L28163,u3606,MARGO,Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
84150,m238,all about eve,L28162,u3600,BILL,Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
84151,m238,all about eve,L28161,u3606,MARGO,Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk talk think eat sleep!
84152,m238,all about eve,L28160,u3600,BILL,Thirty minutes forty minutes! What of it?
84153,m238,all about eve,L28159,u3606,MARGO,Twenty minutes!
84154,m238,all about eve,L28158,u3600,BILL,Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
84155,m238,all about eve,L28157,u3606,MARGO,I don't think that's funny!
84156,m238,all about eve,L28156,u3600,BILL,I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
84157,m238,all about eve,L28155,u3606,MARGO,Clyde Fitch thought you may not think so was well before my time!
84158,m238,all about eve,L28154,u3600,BILL,I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
84159,m238,all about eve,L28153,u3606,MARGO,So you've pointed out so often. So many qualities so often. Her loyalty efficiency devotion warmth affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
84160,m238,all about eve,L28152,u3600,BILL,So she seems.
84161,m238,all about eve,L28151,u3606,MARGO,She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
84162,m238,all about eve,L28150,u3600,BILL,It's a pretty rare quality these days.
84163,m238,all about eve,L28149,u3606,MARGO,She's a girl of so many interests.
84164,m238,all about eve,L28148,u3600,BILL,Well we started talking she wanted to know all about Hollywood she seemed so interested...
84165,m238,all about eve,L28147,u3606,MARGO,That never stopped you before.
84166,m238,all about eve,L28146,u3600,BILL,I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
84167,m238,all about eve,L28145,u3606,MARGO,I had no idea you were even here.
84168,m238,all about eve,L28144,u3600,BILL,When I'm guest of honor?
84169,m238,all about eve,L28143,u3606,MARGO,I thought you were going to be late-
84170,m238,all about eve,L28142,u3600,BILL,Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
84171,m238,all about eve,L28138,u3606,MARGO,Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
84172,m238,all about eve,L28137,u3600,BILL,You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
84173,m238,all about eve,L28136,u3606,MARGO,Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
84174,m238,all about eve,L28099,u3606,MARGO,To put me to bed? Take my clothes off hold my head tuck me in turn off the lights tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you Eve?
84175,m238,all about eve,L28098,u3600,BILL,Need any help?
84176,m238,all about eve,L28092,u3606,MARGO,This is my house not a theater! In my house you're a guest not a director-!

84395,m238,all about eve,L29014,u3602,EVE,I might.
84398,m238,all about eve,L29011,u3602,EVE,Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn isn't it?
84400,m238,all about eve,L29009,u3602,EVE,I've heard of them.
84402,m238,all about eve,L29007,u3602,EVE,What report? To whom?
84404,m238,all about eve,L29005,u3602,EVE,Probably not.
84406,m238,all about eve,L29003,u3602,EVE,What for?
84408,m238,all about eve,L29001,u3602,EVE,You were just looking around...
84410,m238,all about eve,L28999,u3602,EVE,How did you get in here?
84413,m238,all about eve,L28996,u3602,EVE,What are you doing here?
84415,m238,all about eve,L28994,u3602,EVE,Who are you?
84416,m238,all about eve,L28978,u3602,EVE,Thank you Karen.
84417,m238,all about eve,L28977,u3604,KAREN,Congratulations Eve.
84418,m238,all about eve,L28899,u3602,EVE,But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
84419,m238,all about eve,L28898,u3604,KAREN,She knows enough not to be here.
84420,m238,all about eve,L28769,u3602,EVE,I'd do much more - for a part that good.
84421,m238,all about eve,L28768,u3604,KAREN,A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
84422,m238,all about eve,L28766,u3604,KAREN,Over my dead body...
84423,m238,all about eve,L28765,u3602,EVE,Addison wants me to play it.
84424,m238,all about eve,L28764,u3604,KAREN,I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.
84425,m238,all about eve,L28762,u3604,KAREN,You talk just as Addison said you did.
84426,m238,all about eve,L28761,u3602,EVE,It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
84427,m238,all about eve,L28760,u3604,KAREN,After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
84428,m238,all about eve,L28759,u3602,EVE,If you told him so he'd give me the part. He said he would.
84429,m238,all about eve,L28757,u3602,EVE,Something most important you can do.
84430,m238,all about eve,L28756,u3604,KAREN,I think I know...
84431,m238,all about eve,L28754,u3604,KAREN,Give yourself time. Don't worry too much about what people think you're very young and very talented...  ... and believe it or not if there's anything I can do-
84432,m238,all about eve,L28753,u3602,EVE,I wish I could believe that.
84433,m238,all about eve,L28752,u3604,KAREN,Yes you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate success or failure - whatever it is it's here it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
84434,m238,all about eve,L28751,u3602,EVE,I'll never get over it.
84435,m238,all about eve,L28750,u3604,KAREN,Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
84436,m238,all about eve,L28749,u3602,EVE,I wish I'd never met him I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
84437,m238,all about eve,L28748,u3604,KAREN,He can help you.
84438,m238,all about eve,L28747,u3602,EVE,He's not my friend. You were my friends...
84439,m238,all about eve,L28746,u3604,KAREN,Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
84440,m238,all about eve,L28745,u3602,EVE,- an understudy's performance.
84441,m238,all about eve,L28744,u3604,KAREN,But the raves about your performance-
84442,m238,all about eve,L28743,u3602,EVE,Some vague promises of a test that's all - if a particular part should come along one of those things-
84443,m238,all about eve,L28742,u3604,KAREN,Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
84444,m238,all about eve,L28741,u3602,EVE,I'm not crying.
84445,m238,all about eve,L28740,u3604,KAREN,Eve... don't cry.
84446,m238,all about eve,L28739,u3602,EVE,You've really got a low opinion of me haven't you? We'll I'll give you some pleasant news. I've been told off in no uncertain terms all over town. Miss Channing should be happy to hear that. To know how loyal her friends are - how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be...
84447,m238,all about eve,L28738,u3604,KAREN,Let's not get over-dramatic.
84448,m238,all about eve,L28737,u3602,EVE,No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
84449,m238,all about eve,L28736,u3604,KAREN,Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
84450,m238,all about eve,L28735,u3602,EVE,In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean but what he means-
84451,m238,all about eve,L28734,u3604,KAREN,- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
84452,m238,all about eve,L28733,u3602,EVE,You know I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders that sort of thing never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body and couldn't control what I did or said-
84453,m238,all about eve,L28732,u3602,EVE,Why shouldn't you?  Please sit down.
84454,m238,all about eve,L28731,u3604,KAREN,- and easy or not I won't believe a word.
84455,m238,all about eve,L28730,u3602,EVE,Oh but there is-
84456,m238,all about eve,L28729,u3604,KAREN,There can't be very much-
84457,m238,all about eve,L28728,u3602,EVE,I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
84458,m238,all about eve,L28727,u3602,EVE,Can't we sit down? Just for a minute...
84459,m238,all about eve,L28726,u3604,KAREN,I don't intend to be.
84460,m238,all about eve,L28725,u3602,EVE,I don't expect you to be pleasant.
84461,m238,all about eve,L28724,u3604,KAREN,Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
84462,m238,all about eve,L28723,u3602,EVE,I was wondering whether you'd come at all..
84463,m238,all about eve,L28616,u3602,EVE,Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch.
84464,m238,all about eve,L28615,u3604,KAREN,They certainly don't waste much time.
84465,m238,all about eve,L28614,u3602,EVE,We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
84466,m238,all about eve,L28608,u3602,EVE,Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
84467,m238,all about eve,L28607,u3604,KAREN,Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
84468,m238,all about eve,L28180,u3602,EVE,Please...
84469,m238,all about eve,L28179,u3604,KAREN,Don't bother I can take it up myself...
84470,m238,all about eve,L28178,u3602,EVE,May I have your coat?
84471,m238,all about eve,L28120,u3604,KAREN,No Eve I won't forget...
84472,m238,all about eve,L28119,u3602,EVE,Karen...  ... you won't forget will you? What we talked about before?
84473,m238,all about eve,L28112,u3602,EVE,Well - if she's got to pick on someone I'd just as soon it was me.
84474,m238,all about eve,L28111,u3604,KAREN,Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
84475,m238,all about eve,L28110,u3602,EVE,If I thought I'd offended her of all people-
84476,m238,all about eve,L28109,u3604,KAREN,The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
84477,m238,all about eve,L28108,u3602,EVE,But there must be some reason something I've done without knowing...
84478,m238,all about eve,L28107,u3604,KAREN,You mustn't mind Margo too much even if I do...
84479,m238,all about eve,L28041,u3602,EVE,I seem to be forever thanking you for something don't I?
84480,m238,all about eve,L28040,u3604,KAREN,I won't forget.
84481,m238,all about eve,L28039,u3602,EVE,You won't forget it?
84482,m238,all about eve,L28038,u3604,KAREN,Of course.
84483,m238,all about eve,L28037,u3602,EVE,Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?
84484,m238,all about eve,L28036,u3604,KAREN,They'll do as they're told.
84485,m238,all about eve,L28035,u3602,EVE,But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
84486,m238,all about eve,L28034,u3604,KAREN,I think she would cheer.
84487,m238,all about eve,L28033,u3602,EVE,Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
84488,m238,all about eve,L28032,u3604,KAREN,No dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
84489,m238,all about eve,L28031,u3602,EVE,The show must go on.
84490,m238,all about eve,L28030,u3604,KAREN,Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk crawl or roll - she plays.
84491,m238,all about eve,L28029,u3602,EVE,I don't let myself think about it even-  - but I do know the part so well and every bit of the staging there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No I couldn't possibly...
84492,m238,all about eve,L28028,u3604,KAREN,... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
84493,m238,all about eve,L28027,u3602,EVE,Well... Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be really - not that I've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby and they'd have to replace her...
84494,m238,all about eve,L28026,u3604,KAREN,Nobody's done so much Eve you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
84495,m238,all about eve,L28025,u3602,EVE,Karen...  ... isn't it awful I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
84496,m238,all about eve,L28024,u3604,KAREN,Karen.
84497,m238,all about eve,L28023,u3602,EVE,Mrs. Richards.
84498,m238,all about eve,L28022,u3604,KAREN,Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
84499,m238,all about eve,L28021,u3602,EVE,There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say she's been so wonderful done so much for me-
84500,m238,all about eve,L28020,u3604,KAREN,Tell me Eve - how are things with you? Happy?
84501,m238,all about eve,L28019,u3602,EVE,Hollywood.
84502,m238,all about eve,L28018,u3604,KAREN,Discouraging isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
84503,m238,all about eve,L28017,u3602,EVE,Some Hollywood movie star her plane got in late.
84504,m238,all about eve,L28016,u3604,KAREN,Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up...  ... whose is it?
84505,m238,all about eve,L27819,u3602,EVE,I'd like that.
84506,m238,all about eve,L27818,u3604,KAREN,Not just that way. As a friend...
84507,m238,all about eve,L27817,u3602,EVE,I'll be at the old stand tomorrow matinee-
84508,m238,all about eve,L27816,u3604,KAREN,Good night Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
84509,m238,all about eve,L27804,u3602,EVE,I think I'd better. It's been - well I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...
84510,m238,all about eve,L27803,u3604,KAREN,You're not going are you?
84511,m238,all about eve,L27769,u3602,EVE,It couldn't possibly interest you.
84512,m238,all about eve,L27768,u3604,KAREN,Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
84513,m238,all about eve,L27762,u3602,EVE,Well...
84514,m238,all about eve,L27761,u3604,KAREN,Try...
84515,m238,all about eve,L27760,u3602,EVE,If I only knew how...
84516,m238,all about eve,L27729,u3604,KAREN,My husband...
84517,m238,all about eve,L27728,u3602,EVE,Hello Miss Channing.
84518,m238,all about eve,L27725,u3604,KAREN,Not at all.  Margo this is Eve Harrington.
84519,m238,all about eve,L27724,u3602,EVE,I thought you'd forgotten about me.
84520,m238,all about eve,L27679,u3602,EVE,Eve. Eve Harrington.
84521,m238,all about eve,L27678,u3604,KAREN,You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
84522,m238,all about eve,L27677,u3602,EVE,But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean looking like this.
84523,m238,all about eve,L27676,u3604,KAREN,There isn't another like you there couldn't be-
84524,m238,all about eve,L27675,u3602,EVE,No I'd be imposing on her I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
84525,m238,all about eve,L27674,u3604,KAREN,She's got to meet you-
84526,m238,all about eve,L27673,u3602,EVE,Oh no...
84527,m238,all about eve,L27672,u3604,KAREN,I'm going to take you to Margo...
84528,m238,all about eve,L27671,u3602,EVE,Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
84529,m238,all about eve,L27670,u3604,KAREN,You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
84530,m238,all about eve,L27669,u3602,EVE,Oh no. I see the play.
84531,m238,all about eve,L27668,u3604,KAREN,He'll agree with you. Tell me what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
84532,m238,all about eve,L27667,u3602,EVE,He's the best.
84533,m238,all about eve,L27666,u3604,KAREN,Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
84534,m238,all about eve,L27665,u3602,EVE,You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
84535,m238,all about eve,L27664,u3604,KAREN,To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
84536,m238,all about eve,L27663,u3602,EVE,I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
84537,m238,all about eve,L27662,u3604,KAREN,Not at all.
84538,m238,all about eve,L27661,u3602,EVE,I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
84539,m238,all about eve,L27660,u3604,KAREN,Why should you be? After all six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
84540,m238,all about eve,L27659,u3602,EVE,Why should you think I wouldn't be?
84541,m238,all about eve,L27658,u3604,KAREN,So there you are. It seemed odd suddenly your not being there...
84542,m238,all about eve,L28359,u3602,EVE,I was dreadful Miss Channing believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy much less yours...
84543,m238,all about eve,L28358,u3605,LLOYD,Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo let me tell you about Eve-
84544,m238,all about eve,L27821,u3602,EVE,I hope so Mr. Richards. Good night...
84545,m238,all about eve,L27820,u3605,LLOYD,It's been a real pleasure Eve.
84546,m238,all about eve,L27773,u3602,EVE,Farmers were poor in those days that's what dad was - a farmer. I had to help out. So I quit school and I went to Milwaukee. I became a secretary. In a brewery.  When you're a secretary in a brewery - it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. Everything is beer. It wasn't much fun but it helped at home -  and there was a Little Theater Group... like a drop of rain in the desert. That's where I met Eddie. He was a radio technician. We played 'Liliom' for three performances I was awful - then the war came and we got married. Eddie was in the air force - and they sent him to the South Pacific. You were with the O.W.I. weren't you Mr. Richards?  That's what 'Who's Who' says... well with Eddie gone my life went back to beer. Except for a letter a week. One week Eddie wrote he had a leave coming up. I'd saved my money and vacation time. I went to San Francisco to meet him.  Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all. That Eddie was dead...  ... so I figured I'd stay in San Francisco. i was alone but couldn't go back without Eddie. I found a job. And his insurance helped... and there were theaters in San Francisco. And one night Margo Channing came to play in 'Remembrance'... and I went to see it. And - well - here I am...
84547,m238,all about eve,L27772,u3605,LLOYD,Not at all...
84548,m238,all about eve,L27771,u3602,EVE,I guess it started back home. Wisconsin that is. There was just mum and dad - and me. I was the only child and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish aren't I?
84549,m238,all about eve,L27764,u3605,LLOYD,'Remembrance'.
84550,m238,all about eve,L27763,u3602,EVE,Well... it started with the play before this one...
84551,m238,all about eve,L27754,u3605,LLOYD,Let's get back to this one. Have you really seen every performance?  Why? I'm curious...
84552,m238,all about eve,L27753,u3602,EVE,There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
84553,m238,all about eve,L27752,u3605,LLOYD,How'd hear about it?
84554,m238,all about eve,L27747,u3602,EVE,I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
84555,m238,all about eve,L27746,u3605,LLOYD,Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
84556,m238,all about eve,L27745,u3602,EVE,No thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.
84557,m238,all about eve,L27731,u3602,EVE,How do you do Mr. Richards.
84558,m238,all about eve,L27730,u3605,LLOYD,Hello Miss Harrington.

84622,m238,all about eve,L27750,u3602,EVE,Please don't misunderstand me Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing isn't it Mr. Richards?

84632,m238,all about eve,L28630,u3606,MARGO,The little witch must have had Indians runners out snatching critics out of bars steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up... well she won't get away with it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it I will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr. deWitt's ugly throat...
84633,m238,all about eve,L28629,u3604,KAREN,Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
84634,m238,all about eve,L28628,u3606,MARGO,In this rat race everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! One of the differences between the Theater and civilization...  ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance!

84636,m238,all about eve,L28625,u3604,KAREN,I just can't believe it.
84637,m238,all about eve,L28534,u3606,MARGO,Don't give it another thought one of destiny's many pranks. After all you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...

84641,m238,all about eve,L28530,u3606,MARGO,Let's not fumble for excuses not here and now with my hair down. At best let's say I've been oversensitive to... well to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and in the last analysis nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. The end.
84642,m238,all about eve,L28529,u3604,KAREN,Well...
84643,m238,all about eve,L28528,u3606,MARGO,About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her too.
84644,m238,all about eve,L28527,u3604,KAREN,Silly isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
84645,m238,all about eve,L28526,u3606,MARGO,I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
84646,m238,all about eve,L28525,u3606,MARGO,Isn't that what they always say?
84647,m238,all about eve,L28524,u3604,KAREN,Not to you. Not to Bill.
84648,m238,all about eve,L28523,u3606,MARGO,Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
84649,m238,all about eve,L28522,u3604,KAREN,Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
84650,m238,all about eve,L28521,u3606,MARGO,Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her worked with her loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
84651,m238,all about eve,L28520,u3604,KAREN,Why should he - and why should you?
84652,m238,all about eve,L28519,u3606,MARGO,More than anything in this world I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
84653,m238,all about eve,L28518,u3604,KAREN,He's in love with you.
84654,m238,all about eve,L28517,u3606,MARGO,What about Bill?
84655,m238,all about eve,L28516,u3604,KAREN,What about Bill?
84656,m238,all about eve,L28515,u3606,MARGO,And what is that? Besides something spelled out in light bulbs I mean. Besides something called temperament which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice... infants behave the way I do you know. They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want. When they feel unwanted and insecure - or unloved.
84657,m238,all about eve,L28514,u3604,KAREN,You're Margo. Just - Margo.
84658,m238,all about eve,L28513,u3606,MARGO,So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...

84660,m238,all about eve,L28511,u3606,MARGO,Come to think of it I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
84661,m238,all about eve,L28510,u3604,KAREN,We've all seemed a little tense lately...
84662,m238,all about eve,L28509,u3606,MARGO,Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
84663,m238,all about eve,L28508,u3606,MARGO,I detest cheap sentiment.

84667,m238,all about eve,L28504,u3604,KAREN,I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
84668,m238,all about eve,L28503,u3606,MARGO,It seems to me that walking for most people is not very dangerous.
84669,m238,all about eve,L28502,u3604,KAREN,He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-

84675,m238,all about eve,L28489,u3604,KAREN,Roughly ten minutes.

84696,m238,all about eve,L27710,u3606,MARGO,Ain't it the truth?
84697,m238,all about eve,L27709,u3604,KAREN,It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
84698,m238,all about eve,L27708,u3606,MARGO,Relax kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
84699,m238,all about eve,L27704,u3604,KAREN,I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
84700,m238,all about eve,L27703,u3606,MARGO,It's the tight girdle that does it.

84707,m238,all about eve,L28842,u3605,LLOYD,I didn't think you would! It seems to me Karen that for some tine now you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-

84716,m238,all about eve,L28716,u3604,KAREN,I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
84717,m238,all about eve,L28715,u3605,LLOYD,After all maybe she just wants to apologize...
84718,m238,all about eve,L28699,u3604,KAREN,What are you going to wear?
84719,m238,all about eve,L28698,u3605,LLOYD,Three days that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement waking up a village person...
84720,m238,all about eve,L28690,u3604,KAREN,Margo!
84721,m238,all about eve,L28689,u3605,LLOYD,Well of all-
84722,m238,all about eve,L28675,u3605,LLOYD,You - for one. I told her you were set on Margo playing the part - and I certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval.
84723,m238,all about eve,L28674,u3604,KAREN,Such as?
84724,m238,all about eve,L28673,u3605,LLOYD,Darling I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part but there were some practical difficulties...
84725,m238,all about eve,L28672,u3604,KAREN,They'd die without each other.
84726,m238,all about eve,L28671,u3605,LLOYD,I'm glad Bill's back.
84727,m238,all about eve,L28670,u3604,KAREN,Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
84728,m238,all about eve,L28669,u3605,LLOYD,Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight after theater. For a bottle of wine.
84729,m238,all about eve,L28667,u3604,KAREN,The cynicism you refer to I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
84730,m238,all about eve,L28666,u3605,LLOYD,That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
84731,m238,all about eve,L28665,u3604,KAREN,On her knees I have no doubt! Very touching very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
84732,m238,all about eve,L28664,u3605,LLOYD,All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt! She apologized didn't she?
84733,m238,all about eve,L28663,u3604,KAREN,It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious!
84734,m238,all about eve,L28662,u3605,LLOYD,Now just a minute!
84735,m238,all about eve,L28661,u3604,KAREN,Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
84736,m238,all about eve,L28660,u3605,LLOYD,Now just a minute-
84737,m238,all about eve,L28658,u3605,LLOYD,For once to write something and have it realized completely. For once not to compromise-
84738,m238,all about eve,L28657,u3604,KAREN,With gestures of course.
84739,m238,all about eve,L28656,u3605,LLOYD,No I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
84740,m238,all about eve,L28655,u3604,KAREN,Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
84741,m238,all about eve,L28818,u3605,LLOYD,I don't think I could be.
84742,m238,all about eve,L28817,u3606,MARGO,I mean really deeply angry...
84743,m238,all about eve,L28816,u3605,LLOYD,That depends.
84744,m238,all about eve,L28803,u3606,MARGO,She is a louse.
84745,m238,all about eve,L28802,u3605,LLOYD,You know she probably means well after all...
84746,m238,all about eve,L28801,u3606,MARGO,... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that too.
84747,m238,all about eve,L28707,u3606,MARGO,Lloyd I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight no woman is safe...
84748,m238,all about eve,L28706,u3605,LLOYD,Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
84749,m238,all about eve,L28695,u3605,LLOYD,City Hall that's for prize fighters and reporters - I see a cathedral a bishop banks of flowers...
84750,m238,all about eve,L28694,u3606,MARGO,Yes sir.
84751,m238,all about eve,L28683,u3606,MARGO,Too bad.
84752,m238,all about eve,L28682,u3605,LLOYD,It's been quite a night. I understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice.
84753,m238,all about eve,L28501,u3606,MARGO,Thank you Lloyd. Godspeed.
84754,m238,all about eve,L28500,u3605,LLOYD,The audience will want its money refunded believe me.
84755,m238,all about eve,L28499,u3606,MARGO,How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready so willing and so able to go on.
84756,m238,all about eve,L28483,u3606,MARGO,It's not important whether you do. We are wearing long underwear.
84757,m238,all about eve,L28482,u3605,LLOYD,I have no intention of having an accident!
84758,m238,all about eve,L28481,u3606,MARGO,Karen and I just don't want an accident-
84759,m238,all about eve,L28394,u3605,LLOYD,It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto!
84760,m238,all about eve,L28393,u3606,MARGO,Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
84761,m238,all about eve,L28392,u3605,LLOYD,I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?
84762,m238,all about eve,L28378,u3606,MARGO,Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
84763,m238,all about eve,L28377,u3605,LLOYD,I never said it was!
84764,m238,all about eve,L28376,u3606,MARGO,Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to attacked behind my back accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
84765,m238,all about eve,L28375,u3605,LLOYD,You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
84766,m238,all about eve,L28374,u3606,MARGO,Not mouse never mouse! If anything - rat!
84767,m238,all about eve,L28373,u3605,LLOYD,You knew when you came in that the audition was over that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
84768,m238,all about eve,L28372,u3606,MARGO,- in this case apparently as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
84769,m238,all about eve,L28371,u3605,LLOYD,You've been talking to that venomous fishwife Addison deWitt-
84770,m238,all about eve,L28368,u3606,MARGO,It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them!
84771,m238,all about eve,L28367,u3605,LLOYD,That's beside the point.
84772,m238,all about eve,L28366,u3606,MARGO,I mean among other things that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
84773,m238,all about eve,L28365,u3605,LLOYD,What do you mean?
84774,m238,all about eve,L28364,u3606,MARGO,To you too?
84775,m238,all about eve,L28363,u3605,LLOYD,She was a revelation...
84776,m238,all about eve,L28362,u3606,MARGO,I'm sure.
84777,m238,all about eve,L28361,u3605,LLOYD,You'd have been proud of her.
84778,m238,all about eve,L28360,u3606,MARGO,I'm sure you underestimate yourself Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
84779,m238,all about eve,L28349,u3606,MARGO,It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage but with so many people loitering around... well well. So Eve is not working for Max after all-  - Max you sly puss.
84780,m238,all about eve,L28348,u3605,LLOYD,I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
84781,m238,all about eve,L28347,u3606,MARGO,Eve? Eve my understudy? But I had no idea...
84782,m238,all about eve,L28346,u3605,LLOYD,She's your understudy.
84783,m238,all about eve,L28296,u3606,MARGO,... as young as they want you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
84784,m238,all about eve,L28295,u3605,LLOYD,Week after week to thousands of people you're as young as you want...
84785,m238,all about eve,L28294,u3606,MARGO,Spoken like an author.  Lloyd I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
84786,m238,all about eve,L28293,u3605,LLOYD,I know what I'm talking about after all they're my plays...
84787,m238,all about eve,L28292,u3606,MARGO,Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
84788,m238,all about eve,L28291,u3605,LLOYD,Margo you haven't got any age.
84789,m238,all about eve,L28290,u3606,MARGO,Don't be evasive.
84790,m238,all about eve,L28289,u3605,LLOYD,How do you mean?
84791,m238,all about eve,L28288,u3606,MARGO,Don't you think it's about time it became important?
84792,m238,all about eve,L28287,u3605,LLOYD,Twentyish. It isn't important.
84793,m238,all about eve,L28285,u3605,LLOYD,The play? All right I guess...
84794,m238,all about eve,L28284,u3606,MARGO,How's the new one coming?
84795,m238,all about eve,L28283,u3605,LLOYD,I will.
84796,m238,all about eve,L28282,u3606,MARGO,When you do let me in on it.
84797,m238,all about eve,L28281,u3605,LLOYD,Not exactly. Sometimes though I wish I understood you better.
84798,m238,all about eve,L28280,u3606,MARGO,You disapprove of me when I'm like this don't you?
84799,m238,all about eve,L28279,u3606,MARGO,Shucks. And my autograph book is at the cleaners.
84800,m238,all about eve,L28278,u3605,LLOYD,Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
84801,m238,all about eve,L28277,u3606,MARGO,Who's left out there?
84802,m238,all about eve,L28275,u3605,LLOYD,Up in the room.
84803,m238,all about eve,L28274,u3606,MARGO,Where is she?
84804,m238,all about eve,L28273,u3605,LLOYD,There you are both of you. Max Karen has decided it's time to go.
84805,m238,all about eve,L28197,u3606,MARGO,What is he talking about?
84806,m238,all about eve,L28196,u3605,LLOYD,The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
84807,m238,all about eve,L28182,u3606,MARGO,... Among so many quiet qualities.
84808,m238,all about eve,L28181,u3605,LLOYD,I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
84809,m238,all about eve,L28086,u3606,MARGO,And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
84810,m238,all about eve,L28085,u3605,LLOYD,How about calling it a night?
84811,m238,all about eve,L27749,u3605,LLOYD,I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
84812,m238,all about eve,L27748,u3606,MARGO,Would you really? How sweet-
84813,m238,all about eve,L27695,u3606,MARGO,Within your time buster. Lloyd honey be a playwright with guts. Write me one about a nice normal woman who shoots her husband.
84814,m238,all about eve,L27694,u3605,LLOYD,That was way back...
84815,m238,all about eve,L27693,u3606,MARGO,Honey chili had a point. You know I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
84817,m238,all about eve,L27943,u3606,MARGO,I placed...?
84819,m238,all about eve,L27941,u3606,MARGO,That's right but I don't understand-
84821,m238,all about eve,L27939,u3606,MARGO,Call what call?
84823,m238,all about eve,L27937,u3606,MARGO,Hello..
84825,m238,all about eve,L28229,u3606,MARGO,Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
84827,m238,all about eve,L28227,u3606,MARGO,Play it again.
84829,m238,all about eve,L28391,u3606,MARGO,Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
84831,m238,all about eve,L28389,u3606,MARGO,I didn't hear you.
84833,m238,all about eve,L28387,u3606,MARGO,Answer my question!
84835,m238,all about eve,L28385,u3606,MARGO,Are you threatening me with legal action Mr. Fabian?
84837,m238,all about eve,L28272,u3606,MARGO,That's my Max.
84839,m238,all about eve,L28270,u3606,MARGO,Promise.
84841,m238,all about eve,L28268,u3606,MARGO,Think of your health Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
84843,m238,all about eve,L28266,u3606,MARGO,She'd be a great help - read scripts interview people you have to see get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
84845,m238,all about eve,L28264,u3606,MARGO,You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her Max.
84847,m238,all about eve,L28262,u3606,MARGO,You get quick action don't you?
84848,m238,all about eve,L28261,u3606,MARGO,Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
84850,m238,all about eve,L28259,u3606,MARGO,Not at all. And you could do me a big favor if you would-
84852,m238,all about eve,L28257,u3606,MARGO,Anything to help you out Max.
84854,m238,all about eve,L28255,u3606,MARGO,I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
84856,m238,all about eve,L28253,u3606,MARGO,When's the audition?
84858,m238,all about eve,L28251,u3606,MARGO,Well if she can act she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
84860,m238,all about eve,L28249,u3606,MARGO,Miss Caswell?  What?
84862,m238,all about eve,L28247,u3606,MARGO,Here you are Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
84863,m238,all about eve,L28245,u3606,MARGO,I love you Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
84865,m238,all about eve,L28241,u3606,MARGO,Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
84868,m238,all about eve,L28189,u3606,MARGO,Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
84870,m238,all about eve,L28187,u3606,MARGO,Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf eh Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you Max?
94216,m267,being john malkovich,L83038,u4030,MALKOVICH,... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.
94218,m267,being john malkovich,L83036,u4030,MALKOVICH,I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer Craig Schwartz...
94220,m267,being john malkovich,L83034,u4030,MALKOVICH,I'll get right to the point Larry. I'm a puppet now...
94221,m267,being john malkovich,L83029,u4030,MALKOVICH,This is my fiancee Maxine.
94223,m267,being john malkovich,L82628,u4030,MALKOVICH,Yeah okay.
94225,m267,being john malkovich,L82626,u4030,MALKOVICH,I don't know.
94227,m267,being john malkovich,L82624,u4030,MALKOVICH,I never played a jewel thief.
94229,m267,being john malkovich,L82622,u4030,MALKOVICH,Thank you.
94231,m267,being john malkovich,L82618,u4030,MALKOVICH,Malkovich.
94233,m267,being john malkovich,L82614,u4030,MALKOVICH,Yeah.
94236,m267,being john malkovich,L82768,u4020,CRAIG,Tell your friends.
94239,m267,being john malkovich,L82757,u4020,CRAIG,Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
94241,m267,being john malkovich,L82755,u4020,CRAIG,Please have a seat.
94243,m267,being john malkovich,L83240,u4029,LOTTE,Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help.  Also I think you know if you wouldn't mind too terribly a little puppet show every once in a while would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know if you wouldn't mind too terribly.
94244,m267,being john malkovich,L83239,u4020,CRAIG,I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
94245,m267,being john malkovich,L83238,u4029,LOTTE,I know.
94246,m267,being john malkovich,L83237,u4020,CRAIG,I'm through with puppets Lotte. I just want you to know that.
94247,m267,being john malkovich,L83236,u4029,LOTTE,People make mistakes.
94248,m267,being john malkovich,L83235,u4020,CRAIG,You'll have me after all I've done to you?
94249,m267,being john malkovich,L83234,u4029,LOTTE,I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
94250,m267,being john malkovich,L83233,u4020,CRAIG,I suppose. But they got here first the lousy bastards. So now it's all over I guess.
94251,m267,being john malkovich,L83232,u4029,LOTTE,You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing weren't you?
94252,m267,being john malkovich,L83231,u4020,CRAIG,And yourself too in the process. God you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
94253,m267,being john malkovich,L83230,u4029,LOTTE,Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
94254,m267,being john malkovich,L83229,u4020,CRAIG,You came up here looking for the portal?
94255,m267,being john malkovich,L83228,u4029,LOTTE,It's okay Craig. It all worked out in an odd sort of way.
94256,m267,being john malkovich,L83227,u4020,CRAIG,I'm sorry for everything.
94257,m267,being john malkovich,L83226,u4029,LOTTE,A better friend.
94258,m267,being john malkovich,L83225,u4020,CRAIG,Oh right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
94259,m267,being john malkovich,L83224,u4029,LOTTE,The monkey.
94260,m267,being john malkovich,L83223,u4020,CRAIG,The iguana?
94261,m267,being john malkovich,L83222,u4029,LOTTE,It's Elijah.
94262,m267,being john malkovich,L83221,u4020,CRAIG,He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
94263,m267,being john malkovich,L83220,u4029,LOTTE,I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny but when it happens to you there's no question.
94264,m267,being john malkovich,L83219,u4020,CRAIG,I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
94265,m267,being john malkovich,L83218,u4029,LOTTE,My God!
94266,m267,being john malkovich,L82953,u4020,CRAIG,I love you so much.
94267,m267,being john malkovich,L82952,u4029,LOTTE,You're not a monster Craig. Just a confused man.
94268,m267,being john malkovich,L82950,u4029,LOTTE,I need a shower.
94269,m267,being john malkovich,L82949,u4020,CRAIG,Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
94270,m267,being john malkovich,L82948,u4029,LOTTE,Maybe this is what you've always been Craig you just never faced it before.
94271,m267,being john malkovich,L82947,u4020,CRAIG,That's true. Oh God Lotte what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
94272,m267,being john malkovich,L82946,u4029,LOTTE,You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole which is by the way about nine feet nine inches off the mark anyway.
94273,m267,being john malkovich,L82945,u4020,CRAIG,Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
94274,m267,being john malkovich,L82944,u4029,LOTTE,You fell in love with her first.
94275,m267,being john malkovich,L82943,u4020,CRAIG,Things change. Anyway you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
94276,m267,being john malkovich,L82942,u4029,LOTTE,Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
94277,m267,being john malkovich,L82875,u4020,CRAIG,I'm a puppeteer.
94278,m267,being john malkovich,L82874,u4029,LOTTE,What's that?
94279,m267,being john malkovich,L82873,u4020,CRAIG,Ah but you're forgetting one thing Lambchop.
94280,m267,being john malkovich,L82872,u4029,LOTTE,It'll never happen fuckface.
94281,m267,being john malkovich,L82871,u4020,CRAIG,It was lovely being you being Malkovich my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before or her actual tits for that matter. If only I've been thinking to myself if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels rather than just see what he sees... And then dare I say it if only I could control his arms his legs his pelvis and make them do my bidding.
94282,m267,being john malkovich,L82859,u4029,LOTTE,What the hell darling. Close early today live dangerously.
94283,m267,being john malkovich,L82858,u4020,CRAIG,Tell her what the hell close early today live dangerously.
94284,m267,being john malkovich,L82854,u4029,LOTTE,You bastard.
94285,m267,being john malkovich,L82853,u4020,CRAIG,Tell her you need to see her.
94286,m267,being john malkovich,L82852,u4020,CRAIG,Shut up!
94287,m267,being john malkovich,L82851,u4029,LOTTE,Suck my dick!
94288,m267,being john malkovich,L82850,u4020,CRAIG,Yeah well welcome to the nineties.
94289,m267,being john malkovich,L82849,u4029,LOTTE,I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
94290,m267,being john malkovich,L82831,u4020,CRAIG,I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry Lotte. I'm so sorry.
94291,m267,being john malkovich,L82830,u4029,LOTTE,Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together Craig. You know platonically if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
94292,m267,being john malkovich,L82829,u4020,CRAIG,Life is confusing isn't it?
94293,m267,being john malkovich,L82828,u4029,LOTTE,I'm sorry. That was nasty.
94294,m267,being john malkovich,L82827,u4029,LOTTE,Well you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
94295,m267,being john malkovich,L82826,u4020,CRAIG,Don't forget me.

94298,m267,being john malkovich,L82823,u4029,LOTTE,We love her Craig. I'm sorry.
94299,m267,being john malkovich,L82822,u4020,CRAIG,And he was with her.
94300,m267,being john malkovich,L82821,u4029,LOTTE,Yes.
94301,m267,being john malkovich,L82820,u4020,CRAIG,You were him last night weren't you?
94302,m267,being john malkovich,L82802,u4020,CRAIG,We wish.

94304,m267,being john malkovich,L82800,u4020,CRAIG,What about Maxine?
94305,m267,being john malkovich,L82798,u4029,LOTTE,Us of course.
94306,m267,being john malkovich,L82797,u4020,CRAIG,What's that?
94307,m267,being john malkovich,L82796,u4029,LOTTE,I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
94308,m267,being john malkovich,L82795,u4020,CRAIG,You've always loved the animals.
94309,m267,being john malkovich,L82794,u4029,LOTTE,You've always hated the animals.
94310,m267,being john malkovich,L82793,u4020,CRAIG,No they're not.
94311,m267,being john malkovich,L82792,u4029,LOTTE,I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides they're standing between you and me.
94312,m267,being john malkovich,L82791,u4020,CRAIG,What?
94313,m267,being john malkovich,L82790,u4029,LOTTE,I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
94314,m267,being john malkovich,L82789,u4020,CRAIG,You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
94315,m267,being john malkovich,L82788,u4029,LOTTE,Nothing. Don't go Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
94316,m267,being john malkovich,L82787,u4020,CRAIG,I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
94317,m267,being john malkovich,L82786,u4029,LOTTE,What are you doing?
94318,m267,being john malkovich,L82744,u4020,CRAIG,After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
94319,m267,being john malkovich,L82743,u4029,LOTTE,Did you know that Eskimos have not one but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
94320,m267,being john malkovich,L82742,u4029,LOTTE,It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. Well smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
94321,m267,being john malkovich,L82741,u4020,CRAIG,I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
94322,m267,being john malkovich,L82740,u4029,LOTTE,You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
94323,m267,being john malkovich,L82739,u4020,CRAIG,You see men can feel unfulfilled too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
94324,m267,being john malkovich,L82738,u4029,LOTTE,Oh you know not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
94325,m267,being john malkovich,L82737,u4020,CRAIG,So how was it? What was he doing?
94326,m267,being john malkovich,L82723,u4029,LOTTE,Don't crowd me Craig.
94327,m267,being john malkovich,L82722,u4020,CRAIG,Why?
94328,m267,being john malkovich,L82721,u4029,LOTTE,I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
94329,m267,being john malkovich,L82720,u4020,CRAIG,How was it?
94330,m267,being john malkovich,L82701,u4020,CRAIG,This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something do it right.
94331,m267,being john malkovich,L82700,u4029,LOTTE,Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
94332,m267,being john malkovich,L82699,u4020,CRAIG,What are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
94333,m267,being john malkovich,L82698,u4029,LOTTE,I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
94334,m267,being john malkovich,L82697,u4020,CRAIG,Why aren't you at work?
94335,m267,being john malkovich,L82691,u4029,LOTTE,Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
94336,m267,being john malkovich,L82690,u4020,CRAIG,Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?

94339,m267,being john malkovich,L82671,u4020,CRAIG,You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
94340,m267,being john malkovich,L82670,u4029,LOTTE,I have to go back Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
94341,m267,being john malkovich,L82669,u4020,CRAIG,We'll talk about it in the car.
94342,m267,being john malkovich,L82668,u4029,LOTTE,I have to go back now.

94348,m267,being john malkovich,L82659,u4029,LOTTE,Now?
94349,m267,being john malkovich,L82658,u4020,CRAIG,Well you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
94350,m267,being john malkovich,L82657,u4029,LOTTE,I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
94351,m267,being john malkovich,L82656,u4020,CRAIG,What?
94352,m267,being john malkovich,L82655,u4029,LOTTE,I want to try.
94353,m267,being john malkovich,L82654,u4020,CRAIG,Brain. soul I'm telling you Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
94354,m267,being john malkovich,L82653,u4029,LOTTE,Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
94355,m267,being john malkovich,L82584,u4029,LOTTE,'kay.
94356,m267,being john malkovich,L82583,u4020,CRAIG,All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.

94359,m267,being john malkovich,L82580,u4029,LOTTE,I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone putting everyone to bed.
94360,m267,being john malkovich,L82579,u4020,CRAIG,Right.
94361,m267,being john malkovich,L82578,u4029,LOTTE,The iguana.

94363,m267,being john malkovich,L82576,u4029,LOTTE,Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
94364,m267,being john malkovich,L82575,u4020,CRAIG,I'm sorry. How was your evening?
94365,m267,being john malkovich,L82574,u4029,LOTTE,I was worried.
94366,m267,being john malkovich,L82573,u4020,CRAIG,Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just you know hard to get away.

94368,m267,being john malkovich,L82571,u4020,CRAIG,Sorry I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. Were supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is.
94369,m267,being john malkovich,L82570,u4029,LOTTE,Hi.
94370,m267,being john malkovich,L82569,u4020,CRAIG,Hi.

94374,m267,being john malkovich,L82479,u4020,CRAIG,Hmmm.
94375,m267,being john malkovich,L82478,u4029,LOTTE,Some sort of childhood trauma she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting huh?
94376,m267,being john malkovich,L82477,u4020,CRAIG,Hmmm.
94377,m267,being john malkovich,L82476,u4029,LOTTE,They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.

94386,m267,being john malkovich,L82388,u4020,CRAIG,May 11th.
94387,m267,being john malkovich,L82387,u4029,LOTTE,Is the trial date set?
94388,m267,being john malkovich,L82383,u4020,CRAIG,Yeah. Okay.
94389,m267,being john malkovich,L82382,u4029,LOTTE,The monkey.

94391,m267,being john malkovich,L82380,u4029,LOTTE,Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
94392,m267,being john malkovich,L82379,u4020,CRAIG,What?
94393,m267,being john malkovich,L82378,u4029,LOTTE,Craig everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?

94395,m267,being john malkovich,L82376,u4029,LOTTE,Well you know maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
94396,m267,being john malkovich,L82375,u4020,CRAIG,We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
94397,m267,being john malkovich,L82374,u4029,LOTTE,Craig listen honey I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got you know a job or something.
94398,m267,being john malkovich,L82373,u4020,CRAIG,Enjoy.
94399,m267,being john malkovich,L82372,u4029,LOTTE,Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.

94403,m267,being john malkovich,L82937,u4030,MALKOVICH,This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
94404,m267,being john malkovich,L82936,u4020,CRAIG,Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
94405,m267,being john malkovich,L82935,u4030,MALKOVICH,I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
94406,m267,being john malkovich,L82934,u4020,CRAIG,I know. I'm sorry...
94407,m267,being john malkovich,L82933,u4030,MALKOVICH,That... was... no... simulation.

94409,m267,being john malkovich,L82919,u4030,MALKOVICH,Let me try!
94410,m267,being john malkovich,L82918,u4020,CRAIG,You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
94411,m267,being john malkovich,L82917,u4030,MALKOVICH,Let me try.
94412,m267,being john malkovich,L82916,u4020,CRAIG,Sure after a fashion.
94413,m267,being john malkovich,L82915,u4030,MALKOVICH,Simulates?

94415,m267,being john malkovich,L82881,u4030,MALKOVICH,Holy shit! He said what I said!
94416,m267,being john malkovich,L82880,u4020,CRAIG,Holy shit! He said what I said!
94417,m267,being john malkovich,L82879,u4030,MALKOVICH,Holy shit yes!

94422,m267,being john malkovich,L82511,u4020,CRAIG,Floris you're very nice but I'm afraid Im in love with somebody else.
94424,m267,being john malkovich,L82496,u4020,CRAIG,I am a trained performer.
94428,m267,being john malkovich,L82411,u4020,CRAIG,Yes?

94440,m267,being john malkovich,L82776,u4028,LESTER,I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.
94441,m267,being john malkovich,L82775,u4020,CRAIG,You're insane.
94442,m267,being john malkovich,L82774,u4028,LESTER,There are rules boy procedures etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room grooming myself quietly setting the stage performing ablutions paying tribute seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping Schwartz worshipping properly.
94443,m267,being john malkovich,L82773,u4020,CRAIG,Dr. Lester I don't know what you're talking about.
94444,m267,being john malkovich,L82772,u4028,LESTER,You're making a big mistake Schwartz.  Ma'am
94445,m267,being john malkovich,L82686,u4028,LESTER,The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned Schwartz there are certain doors which should never be opened.
94446,m267,being john malkovich,L82685,u4020,CRAIG,Uh import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
94447,m267,being john malkovich,L82684,u4028,LESTER,And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
94448,m267,being john malkovich,L82683,u4020,CRAIG,No sir not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
94449,m267,being john malkovich,L82682,u4028,LESTER,I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
94450,m267,being john malkovich,L82681,u4020,CRAIG,No thank you sir. It's delicious though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
94451,m267,being john malkovich,L82680,u4028,LESTER,More beet-spinach juice my friend?
94452,m267,being john malkovich,L82679,u4020,CRAIG,Dr. Lester...
94453,m267,being john malkovich,L82600,u4020,CRAIG,Thank you sir.
94454,m267,being john malkovich,L82599,u4028,LESTER,Ah. yes the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry you'll just make it.
94455,m267,being john malkovich,L82598,u4020,CRAIG,Dr. Lester I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
94456,m267,being john malkovich,L82597,u4028,LESTER,Ah Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade and never never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
94457,m267,being john malkovich,L82596,u4020,CRAIG,Dr. Lester. . .
94458,m267,being john malkovich,L82544,u4020,CRAIG,That's sounds fine sir. Gotta run.
94459,m267,being john malkovich,L82543,u4028,LESTER,Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like Schwartz.
94460,m267,being john malkovich,L82542,u4020,CRAIG,Yessir.
94461,m267,being john malkovich,L82541,u4028,LESTER,Wife huh? I'd love to meet her Craig.
94462,m267,being john malkovich,L82540,u4020,CRAIG,Dr. Lester it's been really fascinating but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
94463,m267,being john malkovich,L82539,u4028,LESTER,Imagine a room full of women. Nubile blonde wet with desire Schwartz. A harem if you will. Me in leather. A harness if you like. I am the object of this desire and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies I begin. I am the love god Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
94464,m267,being john malkovich,L82521,u4028,LESTER,All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
94465,m267,being john malkovich,L82520,u4020,CRAIG,Dr. Lester while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
94466,m267,being john malkovich,L82519,u4028,LESTER,I don't want to be your godamn link damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh God the agony of the flesh Schwartz.
94467,m267,being john malkovich,L82518,u4020,CRAIG,The elderly have so much to offer sir. They are our link with history.
94468,m267,being john malkovich,L82517,u4028,LESTER,No sir-e-bob I don't die. But what I do is get older wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh to be a young man again maybe then Floris would care for me.
94469,m267,being john malkovich,L82516,u4020,CRAIG,I'll keep that in mind sir.
94470,m267,being john malkovich,L82515,u4028,LESTER,One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh and I have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die Schwartz.
94471,m267,being john malkovich,L82514,u4020,CRAIG,I wasn't toying with her sir. I was just... How old are you?
94472,m267,being john malkovich,L82513,u4028,LESTER,Don't toy with Floris Schwartz. Why if I were eighty years younger I'd box your ears.
94473,m267,being john malkovich,L82438,u4028,LESTER,Low overhead m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously that's all covered in orientation.
94474,m267,being john malkovich,L82437,u4020,CRAIG,Just one. Why is this floor so short?
94475,m267,being john malkovich,L82436,u4028,LESTER,Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
94476,m267,being john malkovich,L82435,u4020,CRAIG,No. I understand perfectly.
94477,m267,being john malkovich,L82434,u4028,LESTER,Pity it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern read Jewish publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying Dr. Schwartz.
94478,m267,being john malkovich,L82433,u4020,CRAIG,No.
94479,m267,being john malkovich,L82431,u4020,CRAIG,You don't have a speech impediment Dr. Lester.
94480,m267,being john malkovich,L82425,u4028,LESTER,Damn you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay put these in order.
94481,m267,being john malkovich,L82424,u4020,CRAIG,Glooph is not a letter sir.
94482,m267,being john malkovich,L82423,u4028,LESTER,You think so eh? Which comes first L or... Glooph?
94483,m267,being john malkovich,L82422,u4020,CRAIG,Well sir I'm an excellent filer.
94484,m267,being john malkovich,L82421,u4028,LESTER,Tell me Dr. Schwartz what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
94485,m267,being john malkovich,L82420,u4020,CRAIG,Not at all Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
94486,m267,being john malkovich,L82419,u4028,LESTER,She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison and I'm not banging her if that's what youre implying.
94487,m267,being john malkovich,L82418,u4020,CRAIG,No it's okay sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
94488,m267,being john malkovich,L82417,u4028,LESTER,Security.
94489,m267,being john malkovich,L82416,u4020,CRAIG,Actually my name is Craig Schwartz Dr. Lester.
94490,m267,being john malkovich,L82415,u4028,LESTER,Come in Mr. Juarez. I'd stand but well you know.
94491,m267,being john malkovich,L82955,u4032,MAXINE,J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
94492,m267,being john malkovich,L82954,u4020,CRAIG,But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
94493,m267,being john malkovich,L82924,u4032,MAXINE,How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
94494,m267,being john malkovich,L82923,u4020,CRAIG,What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
94495,m267,being john malkovich,L82921,u4020,CRAIG,Of course right this way Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
94496,m267,being john malkovich,L82920,u4032,MAXINE,Let him try.
94497,m267,being john malkovich,L82883,u4020,CRAIG,Yes yes sweetheart yes!
94498,m267,being john malkovich,L82882,u4032,MAXINE,Lotte? Is that you?
94499,m267,being john malkovich,L82877,u4020,CRAIG,Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
94500,m267,being john malkovich,L82876,u4032,MAXINE,Lotte this is so good...
94501,m267,being john malkovich,L82870,u4032,MAXINE,A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
94502,m267,being john malkovich,L82869,u4020,CRAIG,You're glowing again.
94503,m267,being john malkovich,L82838,u4032,MAXINE,Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill Craig.
94504,m267,being john malkovich,L82837,u4020,CRAIG,You're evil Maxine.
94505,m267,being john malkovich,L82836,u4032,MAXINE,You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
94506,m267,being john malkovich,L82835,u4020,CRAIG,I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
94507,m267,being john malkovich,L82834,u4032,MAXINE,I've fallen in love.
94508,m267,being john malkovich,L82833,u4020,CRAIG,Are you torturing me on purpose?
94509,m267,being john malkovich,L82832,u4032,MAXINE,You're late.
94510,m267,being john malkovich,L82771,u4032,MAXINE,So unbolt the fucking door Einstein.
94511,m267,being john malkovich,L82770,u4020,CRAIG,This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
94512,m267,being john malkovich,L82750,u4020,CRAIG,My God.
94513,m267,being john malkovich,L82749,u4032,MAXINE,Craig I just don't find you attractive. And Lotte I'm smitten with you but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness I sensed your feminine longing peering out and it just slew me.
94514,m267,being john malkovich,L82689,u4020,CRAIG,Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
94515,m267,being john malkovich,L82688,u4032,MAXINE,Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc. Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc. etc.
94516,m267,being john malkovich,L82651,u4032,MAXINE,I'll protect you Dollface.
94517,m267,being john malkovich,L82650,u4020,CRAIG,Really?  But Maxine can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
94518,m267,being john malkovich,L82649,u4032,MAXINE,Sure. It'd be fun.
94519,m267,being john malkovich,L82648,u4020,CRAIG,You wanted to be partners with me?
94520,m267,being john malkovich,L82647,u4032,MAXINE,Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you but this way it's more money for me.
94521,m267,being john malkovich,L82646,u4020,CRAIG,But there's something profound here Maxine we can't exploit it.
94522,m267,being john malkovich,L82645,u4032,MAXINE,Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
94523,m267,being john malkovich,L82644,u4020,CRAIG,Tickets to Malkovich?
94524,m267,being john malkovich,L82643,u4032,MAXINE,Good. We'll sell tickets.
94525,m267,being john malkovich,L82642,u4020,CRAIG,Yes of course. He's a celebrity.
94526,m267,being john malkovich,L82641,u4032,MAXINE,Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
94527,m267,being john malkovich,L82640,u4020,CRAIG,Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing supernatural for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
94528,m267,being john malkovich,L82639,u4032,MAXINE,What's he been in?
94529,m267,being john malkovich,L82638,u4020,CRAIG,He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
94530,m267,being john malkovich,L82637,u4032,MAXINE,Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
94531,m267,being john malkovich,L82636,u4020,CRAIG,There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes then after about fifteen minutes you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
94532,m267,being john malkovich,L82635,u4032,MAXINE,It better be.
94533,m267,being john malkovich,L82634,u4020,CRAIG,This is important!
94534,m267,being john malkovich,L82633,u4032,MAXINE,No.
94535,m267,being john malkovich,L82632,u4020,CRAIG,Don't you want to know what happened to me?
94536,m267,being john malkovich,L82592,u4032,MAXINE,You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
94537,m267,being john malkovich,L82591,u4020,CRAIG,It's just and I've never done this before Maxine but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone not even my wife. My future is with you Maxine.
94538,m267,being john malkovich,L82590,u4020,CRAIG,Please let me explain.
94539,m267,being john malkovich,L82589,u4032,MAXINE,Yikes.
94540,m267,being john malkovich,L82588,u4020,CRAIG,Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else feeling what they feel seeing what they see...
94541,m267,being john malkovich,L82587,u4032,MAXINE,You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
94542,m267,being john malkovich,L82586,u4020,CRAIG,Hi.
94543,m267,being john malkovich,L82567,u4020,CRAIG,Well I'm a puppeteer...
94544,m267,being john malkovich,L82566,u4032,MAXINE,So tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough dog-boy.
94545,m267,being john malkovich,L82565,u4032,MAXINE,Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
94546,m267,being john malkovich,L82564,u4020,CRAIG,No wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
94547,m267,being john malkovich,L82563,u4032,MAXINE,I mean I am really attracted to you. Jesus you are a fag. We can share recipes if you like Darlene.
94548,m267,being john malkovich,L82562,u4020,CRAIG,I mean I am really attracted to you.
94549,m267,being john malkovich,L82561,u4032,MAXINE,You're a fag or a liar.
94550,m267,being john malkovich,L82560,u4020,CRAIG,Im not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
94551,m267,being john malkovich,L82558,u4032,MAXINE,Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
94552,m267,being john malkovich,L82557,u4020,CRAIG,That's the usual?
94553,m267,being john malkovich,L82556,u4032,MAXINE,Christ you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
94554,m267,being john malkovich,L82555,u4020,CRAIG,No no it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
94555,m267,being john malkovich,L82554,u4032,MAXINE,My tits?
94556,m267,being john malkovich,L82553,u4020,CRAIG,I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
94557,m267,being john malkovich,L82552,u4020,CRAIG,I'll have like a beer. Like a Budweiser or something.
94558,m267,being john malkovich,L82551,u4032,MAXINE,The usual Barry.
94559,m267,being john malkovich,L82550,u4020,CRAIG,What'll you have?
94560,m267,being john malkovich,L82549,u4020,CRAIG,Yeah. But enough about me.
94561,m267,being john malkovich,L82548,u4032,MAXINE,You married?
94562,m267,being john malkovich,L82547,u4020,CRAIG,Buy you a drink Maxine?
94563,m267,being john malkovich,L82546,u4032,MAXINE,Just.
94564,m267,being john malkovich,L82545,u4020,CRAIG,Made it. Maxine. Maxine Maxine Maxine.
94565,m267,being john malkovich,L82538,u4020,CRAIG,Maxine.
94566,m267,being john malkovich,L82537,u4032,MAXINE,I am dubious but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late I walk. So help me if I find out you cheated.
94567,m267,being john malkovich,L82536,u4020,CRAIG,Oh Maxine nobody told me. Maxine Maxine. It just came out of me like a song Maxine. A beautiful crazy song Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
94568,m267,being john malkovich,L82535,u4032,MAXINE,Somebody told you.
94569,m267,being john malkovich,L82534,u4020,CRAIG,That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
94570,m267,being john malkovich,L82533,u4032,MAXINE,Who told you?
94571,m267,being john malkovich,L82532,u4020,CRAIG,I'm right?
94572,m267,being john malkovich,L82531,u4032,MAXINE,Who told you?
94573,m267,being john malkovich,L82530,u4020,CRAIG,Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
94574,m267,being john malkovich,L82529,u4032,MAXINE,Why not?
94575,m267,being john malkovich,L82528,u4020,CRAIG,How about this if I can guess your first name within three tries you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
94576,m267,being john malkovich,L82527,u4032,MAXINE,Yeah.
94577,m267,being john malkovich,L82526,u4020,CRAIG,I just wanted to say hi.  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
94578,m267,being john malkovich,L82525,u4032,MAXINE,What?
94579,m267,being john malkovich,L82503,u4032,MAXINE,You know if you ever got me you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing Romeo.
94580,m267,being john malkovich,L82502,u4020,CRAIG,No really.
94581,m267,being john malkovich,L82501,u4032,MAXINE,And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
94582,m267,being john malkovich,L82500,u4020,CRAIG,You know I've been thinking about what you said yesterday about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
94583,m267,being john malkovich,L82499,u4032,MAXINE,Yes well...
94584,m267,being john malkovich,L82464,u4032,MAXINE,I wouldn't know.
94585,m267,being john malkovich,L82463,u4020,CRAIG,Emily Dickinson.
94586,m267,being john malkovich,L82462,u4032,MAXINE,How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
94587,m267,being john malkovich,L82461,u4020,CRAIG,Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz just starting out at LesterCorp.
94588,m267,being john malkovich,L82460,u4032,MAXINE,Well truth is for suckers isn't it?.
94589,m267,being john malkovich,L82459,u4020,CRAIG,Is that true?
94590,m267,being john malkovich,L82458,u4032,MAXINE,Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
94591,m267,being john malkovich,L82457,u4020,CRAIG,Moving story.
94602,m267,being john malkovich,L83215,u4029,LOTTE,I'll be with you always my friends. Who knows maybe if I'm lucky I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
94603,m267,being john malkovich,L83214,u4029,LOTTE,Hush sweetheart.
94605,m267,being john malkovich,L83212,u4029,LOTTE,Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me who?
94608,m267,being john malkovich,L83173,u4029,LOTTE,I'm glad you learned sign language Elijah but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
94611,m267,being john malkovich,L82765,u4032,MAXINE,Two hundred dollars please.
94613,m267,being john malkovich,L82763,u4032,MAXINE,You can be John Malkovich.
94615,m267,being john malkovich,L82761,u4032,MAXINE,No. Don't be an ass.
94617,m267,being john malkovich,L82759,u4032,MAXINE,No.
94618,m267,being john malkovich,L83171,u4028,LESTER,Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh there's a letter from Alex Trebek.
94620,m267,being john malkovich,L83169,u4028,LESTER,Fine. I mean it's not like I was doubting you it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
94622,m267,being john malkovich,L83167,u4028,LESTER,I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
94624,m267,being john malkovich,L83165,u4028,LESTER,Can you do that? I mean do you know anything about puppetry?
94626,m267,being john malkovich,L83163,u4028,LESTER,I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
94628,m267,being john malkovich,L83161,u4028,LESTER,Do tell. I love a good plan.
94631,m267,being john malkovich,L83157,u4028,LESTER,The Great Mantini?
94633,m267,being john malkovich,L83155,u4028,LESTER,What kind of circumstances?
94635,m267,being john malkovich,L83153,u4028,LESTER,How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
94636,m267,being john malkovich,L83110,u4028,LESTER,I like that.
94638,m267,being john malkovich,L83108,u4028,LESTER,A scary dream?
94640,m267,being john malkovich,L83106,u4028,LESTER,Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
94642,m267,being john malkovich,L83104,u4028,LESTER,The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
94644,m267,being john malkovich,L83102,u4028,LESTER,We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
94647,m267,being john malkovich,L83080,u4028,LESTER,Didn't mean to imply that you were sir.
94649,m267,being john malkovich,L83078,u4028,LESTER,And as I said sir we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
94651,m267,being john malkovich,L82843,u4028,LESTER,Good morning Lotte!
94653,m267,being john malkovich,L82841,u4028,LESTER,Thank you Floris.
94655,m267,being john malkovich,L82839,u4028,LESTER,Yes my dear?
94656,m267,being john malkovich,L82430,u4028,LESTER,Fine woman Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
94658,m267,being john malkovich,L82428,u4028,LESTER,Forget it.
94660,m267,being john malkovich,L82426,u4028,LESTER,Floris get Guinness on the phone.
94661,m267,being john malkovich,L83181,u4030,MALKOVICH,Do you?
94663,m267,being john malkovich,L83179,u4030,MALKOVICH,Says who?
94665,m267,being john malkovich,L83177,u4030,MALKOVICH,Do you?
94668,m267,being john malkovich,L82902,u4030,MALKOVICH,I gotta know the truth Kevin.
94670,m267,being john malkovich,L82900,u4030,MALKOVICH,I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
94672,m267,being john malkovich,L82898,u4030,MALKOVICH,I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
94674,m267,being john malkovich,L82896,u4030,MALKOVICH,I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
94676,m267,being john malkovich,L82894,u4030,MALKOVICH,Yes but you see someone else was talking through my mouth.
94678,m267,being john malkovich,L82892,u4030,MALKOVICH,Kevin I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
94680,m267,being john malkovich,L82890,u4030,MALKOVICH,It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
94681,m267,being john malkovich,L83076,u4028,LESTER,Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
94683,m267,being john malkovich,L83074,u4028,LESTER,But of course.
94685,m267,being john malkovich,L83072,u4028,LESTER,Anybody else?
94686,m267,being john malkovich,L83062,u4028,LESTER,Lots of carrot juice little lady. That and a deal with the Devil.
94688,m267,being john malkovich,L83052,u4028,LESTER,I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
94689,m267,being john malkovich,L83051,u4029,LOTTE,That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order Son of Malkovich.
94690,m267,being john malkovich,L83050,u4028,LESTER,I'm not certain my dear but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
94691,m267,being john malkovich,L83049,u4029,LOTTE,Why not? I need to get in there!
94692,m267,being john malkovich,L83048,u4028,LESTER,Thank you all for your efforts but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
94693,m267,being john malkovich,L83022,u4028,LESTER,I understand but we must protect the vessel at all costs.  Please Craig please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
94694,m267,being john malkovich,L83021,u4029,LOTTE,It's Craig in there I can tell.
94695,m267,being john malkovich,L83020,u4028,LESTER,No! Don't harm the vessel!
94696,m267,being john malkovich,L83019,u4029,LOTTE,You bastard!
94697,m267,being john malkovich,L83018,u4028,LESTER,Aaaahhhh the portal!
94698,m267,being john malkovich,L82988,u4028,LESTER,Oh sorry. Right this way.
94699,m267,being john malkovich,L82987,u4029,LOTTE,No.
94700,m267,being john malkovich,L82986,u4028,LESTER,Oh didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
94701,m267,being john malkovich,L82985,u4029,LOTTE,No I didn't know that.
94702,m267,being john malkovich,L82984,u4028,LESTER,What?! That is not allowed. My God you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
94703,m267,being john malkovich,L82983,u4029,LOTTE,No you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
94704,m267,being john malkovich,L82982,u4028,LESTER,Hmmm a lesbian are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
94705,m267,being john malkovich,L82981,u4029,LOTTE,Craig stole Maxine from me Dr. Lester.
94706,m267,being john malkovich,L82980,u4028,LESTER,You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible my dear.
94707,m267,being john malkovich,L82848,u4028,LESTER,My child I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
94708,m267,being john malkovich,L82847,u4029,LOTTE,But now we've lost access to Craig.
94709,m267,being john malkovich,L82846,u4028,LESTER,You followed your heart my child and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
94710,m267,being john malkovich,L82845,u4029,LOTTE,I blew it Dr. Lester.
94711,m267,being john malkovich,L82785,u4028,LESTER,We need you on the inside my child. To report on his comings and goings and if need be to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
94712,m267,being john malkovich,L82784,u4029,LOTTE,But why Son of Malkovich?
94713,m267,being john malkovich,L82783,u4028,LESTER,No you mustn't my child.
94714,m267,being john malkovich,L82782,u4029,LOTTE,I'm getting divorced.
94715,m267,being john malkovich,L82678,u4028,LESTER,With immense pleasure my dear. Down that hall ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken you know.
94716,m267,being john malkovich,L82677,u4029,LOTTE,Dr. Lester would you point me toward the restroom?
94717,m267,being john malkovich,L82676,u4028,LESTER,Oh be still my heart.
94718,m267,being john malkovich,L82675,u4029,LOTTE,Yes of course Dr. Lester.
94719,m267,being john malkovich,L82674,u4028,LESTER,Tell me Lotte can you understand a word I'm saying?
94720,m267,being john malkovich,L82967,u4032,MAXINE,I thought so too doll. I guess we were mistaken.
94721,m267,being john malkovich,L82966,u4029,LOTTE,But Maxine I thought it was me you loved.
94722,m267,being john malkovich,L82965,u4032,MAXINE,Really? Well you know he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
94723,m267,being john malkovich,L82964,u4029,LOTTE,Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh God it's been him!
94724,m267,being john malkovich,L82957,u4032,MAXINE,One hour.
94725,m267,being john malkovich,L82956,u4029,LOTTE,We have to meet.
94726,m267,being john malkovich,L82857,u4032,MAXINE,Sweetie! Oh but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.
94727,m267,being john malkovich,L82856,u4029,LOTTE,I have to see you.
94728,m267,being john malkovich,L82855,u4032,MAXINE,J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
94729,m267,being john malkovich,L82813,u4029,LOTTE,Maxine...
94730,m267,being john malkovich,L82812,u4032,MAXINE,I love you Lotte.
94731,m267,being john malkovich,L82811,u4029,LOTTE,Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
94732,m267,being john malkovich,L82806,u4029,LOTTE,Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
94733,m267,being john malkovich,L82805,u4032,MAXINE,When?
94734,m267,being john malkovich,L82804,u4029,LOTTE,I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
94735,m267,being john malkovich,L82803,u4032,MAXINE,Yes?
94736,m267,being john malkovich,L82746,u4029,LOTTE,After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey Elijah. He's got an ulcer due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.
94737,m267,being john malkovich,L82745,u4032,MAXINE,Ah.
94738,m267,being john malkovich,L82734,u4029,LOTTE,I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
94739,m267,being john malkovich,L82733,u4032,MAXINE,And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
94740,m267,being john malkovich,L82702,u4029,LOTTE,Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man Craig.
94741,m267,being john malkovich,L82695,u4029,LOTTE,Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
94742,m267,being john malkovich,L82693,u4029,LOTTE,Yes Hi.
94743,m267,being john malkovich,L82692,u4032,MAXINE,Yes hello I wanted to place an ad.  Hi are you Craig's wife?
94744,m267,being john malkovich,L83152,u4030,MALKOVICH,Who needs dancing?
94746,m267,being john malkovich,L83150,u4030,MALKOVICH,Is there dancing?
94749,m267,being john malkovich,L83146,u4030,MALKOVICH,Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
94751,m267,being john malkovich,L83144,u4030,MALKOVICH,Never heard of it.
94752,m267,being john malkovich,L83142,u4030,MALKOVICH,What's the play?
94754,m267,being john malkovich,L83140,u4030,MALKOVICH,How do we do that?
94756,m267,being john malkovich,L83136,u4030,MALKOVICH,She's not available.
94757,m267,being john malkovich,L83133,u4030,MALKOVICH,Because if you missed any I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
94759,m267,being john malkovich,L83131,u4030,MALKOVICH,Did you see the reviews?
94761,m267,being john malkovich,L83201,u4032,MAXINE,Whatever.
94762,m267,being john malkovich,L83200,u4030,MALKOVICH,Good-bye Maxine.
94763,m267,being john malkovich,L83129,u4030,MALKOVICH,Derek Mantini!
94764,m267,being john malkovich,L83128,u4032,MAXINE,Yeah what?!
94765,m267,being john malkovich,L83127,u4032,MAXINE,Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
94766,m267,being john malkovich,L83126,u4030,MALKOVICH,Honey we can be happy and poor together.
94767,m267,being john malkovich,L83123,u4030,MALKOVICH,I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
94768,m267,being john malkovich,L83122,u4032,MAXINE,You've got to be kidding.
94769,m267,being john malkovich,L83121,u4030,MALKOVICH,I've got to leave Malkovich.
94770,m267,being john malkovich,L83120,u4032,MAXINE,Bad dream darling?
94771,m267,being john malkovich,L83114,u4032,MAXINE,Busy day my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed and I'll meet you there in just...
94772,m267,being john malkovich,L83113,u4030,MALKOVICH,Sleepy suddenly.
94773,m267,being john malkovich,L83112,u4032,MAXINE,Oh darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
94774,m267,being john malkovich,L83089,u4030,MALKOVICH,He's a selfish bastard.
94775,m267,being john malkovich,L83088,u4032,MAXINE,Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
94776,m267,being john malkovich,L83087,u4030,MALKOVICH,I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
94777,m267,being john malkovich,L83086,u4032,MAXINE,This is it lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
94778,m267,being john malkovich,L83040,u4030,MALKOVICH,Vegas. Can you arrange that?
94779,m267,being john malkovich,L83039,u4032,MAXINE,Vegas.
94780,m267,being john malkovich,L83017,u4032,MAXINE,It's okay my sweet.
94781,m267,being john malkovich,L83016,u4030,MALKOVICH,Shut up!  Sorry dear I lost control for a minute.
94782,m267,being john malkovich,L83010,u4032,MAXINE,Oh Craiggy that's brilliant!
94783,m267,being john malkovich,L83009,u4030,MALKOVICH,Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
94784,m267,being john malkovich,L83008,u4032,MAXINE,No one would ever have to know its not him.
94785,m267,being john malkovich,L83007,u4030,MALKOVICH,No! Please!  Shut up will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
94786,m267,being john malkovich,L83006,u4032,MAXINE,Well we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
94787,m267,being john malkovich,L83005,u4030,MALKOVICH,No!  But how will we make a living my love if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
94788,m267,being john malkovich,L83004,u4032,MAXINE,Stay in him forever?
94789,m267,being john malkovich,L83003,u4032,MAXINE,You're right my darling it's so much more. It's playing with people!
94790,m267,being john malkovich,L83002,u4030,MALKOVICH,You see Maxine it isn't just playing with dolls.
94791,m267,being john malkovich,L83001,u4032,MAXINE,That was incredible. You're brilliant!
94792,m267,being john malkovich,L82999,u4030,MALKOVICH,Really? Yeah. Okay.
94793,m267,being john malkovich,L82998,u4032,MAXINE,I'd love to see your work.
94794,m267,being john malkovich,L82997,u4030,MALKOVICH,You mean with Malkovich?
94795,m267,being john malkovich,L82996,u4032,MAXINE,Wow.  Do a puppet show for me Craig honey.
94796,m267,being john malkovich,L82995,u4030,MALKOVICH,Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough it's all in the wrists.
94797,m267,being john malkovich,L82994,u4032,MAXINE,You still there sweets?
94798,m267,being john malkovich,L82979,u4030,MALKOVICH,No... damn... you...  Oh shut up you overrated sack of shit.
94799,m267,being john malkovich,L82978,u4032,MAXINE,I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table then make him eat an omelette off of it.
94800,m267,being john malkovich,L82977,u4030,MALKOVICH,I'm getting better all the time.
94801,m267,being john malkovich,L82976,u4032,MAXINE,Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
94802,m267,being john malkovich,L82975,u4030,MALKOVICH,Oh so the bitch escaped.
94803,m267,being john malkovich,L82974,u4032,MAXINE,Lotte called me.
94804,m267,being john malkovich,L82973,u4030,MALKOVICH,Yes. How did you know it was me?
94805,m267,being john malkovich,L82972,u4032,MAXINE,Oh shut up.  Craig darling are you in there?
94806,m267,being john malkovich,L82971,u4030,MALKOVICH,Don't con me Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
94807,m267,being john malkovich,L82970,u4032,MAXINE,I can explain about the portal darling.
94808,m267,being john malkovich,L82969,u4030,MALKOVICH,Come on in.
94809,m267,being john malkovich,L82913,u4030,MALKOVICH,What the fuck is going on?
94810,m267,being john malkovich,L82912,u4032,MAXINE,Darling!
94811,m267,being john malkovich,L82888,u4030,MALKOVICH,No Dollface I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.
94812,m267,being john malkovich,L82887,u4032,MAXINE,Oh Dollface it was just your passion for me taking hold.
94813,m267,being john malkovich,L82886,u4030,MALKOVICH,Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
94814,m267,being john malkovich,L82885,u4032,MAXINE,Oh Lotte...
94815,m267,being john malkovich,L82884,u4030,MALKOVICH,Yes yes sweetheart yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
94816,m267,being john malkovich,L82818,u4030,MALKOVICH,Yes Maxine yes.
94817,m267,being john malkovich,L82817,u4032,MAXINE,Oh my sweet beautiful Lotte.
94818,m267,being john malkovich,L82816,u4030,MALKOVICH,No I guess not. I'm an actor.
94819,m267,being john malkovich,L82815,u4032,MAXINE,Do you mind?
94820,m267,being john malkovich,L82810,u4030,MALKOVICH,Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
94821,m267,being john malkovich,L82809,u4032,MAXINE,So do you enjoy being an actor?
94822,m267,being john malkovich,L82808,u4030,MALKOVICH,Oh I'm really glad you called.
94823,m267,being john malkovich,L82807,u4032,MAXINE,Thanks so much for coming over.
94824,m267,being john malkovich,L82736,u4032,MAXINE,Whatever you're having.
94825,m267,being john malkovich,L82735,u4030,MALKOVICH,Can I get you a drink?
94826,m267,being john malkovich,L82715,u4032,MAXINE,It's just that I fantasize about you and well speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
94827,m267,being john malkovich,L82714,u4030,MALKOVICH,How'd you get this number?
94828,m267,being john malkovich,L82713,u4032,MAXINE,You don't know me but I'm a great admirer of yours.
94829,m267,being john malkovich,L82712,u4030,MALKOVICH,Who's calling?
94830,m267,being john malkovich,L82711,u4032,MAXINE,Mr. Malkovich?
94831,m267,being john malkovich,L82710,u4030,MALKOVICH,Yeah?
105241,m293,charade,L126766,u4411,ADAM,What are you talking about?
105243,m293,charade,L126764,u4411,ADAM,You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
105245,m293,charade,L126762,u4411,ADAM,All right -- where's the letter?
105247,m293,charade,L126689,u4411,ADAM,Where are you ol' buddy?
105249,m293,charade,L126934,u4411,ADAM,What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
105250,m293,charade,L126933,u4421,REGGIE,Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
105251,m293,charade,L126932,u4411,ADAM,Reggie -- listen to me --
105252,m293,charade,L126931,u4421,REGGIE,Then say it.
105253,m293,charade,L126930,u4411,ADAM,I heard you I heard you.
105254,m293,charade,L126929,u4421,REGGIE,I said tell me to go to the --
105255,m293,charade,L126928,u4421,REGGIE,All right prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps.
105256,m293,charade,L126927,u4411,ADAM,What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
105257,m293,charade,L126926,u4421,REGGIE,The truth now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
105258,m293,charade,L126925,u4411,ADAM,And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
105259,m293,charade,L126924,u4421,REGGIE,I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
105260,m293,charade,L126922,u4411,ADAM,Here give it to me.
105261,m293,charade,L126921,u4421,REGGIE,You didn't have to chase me so hard --
105262,m293,charade,L126900,u4411,ADAM,There's not a reason on earth why you should.
105263,m293,charade,L126899,u4421,REGGIE,Can I really believe you this time Adam?
105264,m293,charade,L126898,u4411,ADAM,Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
105265,m293,charade,L126897,u4421,REGGIE,You lied to me so many times --
105266,m293,charade,L126896,u4411,ADAM,Reggie -- listen to me!
105267,m293,charade,L126893,u4411,ADAM,Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
105268,m293,charade,L126892,u4421,REGGIE,He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
105269,m293,charade,L126881,u4421,REGGIE,No!
105270,m293,charade,L126880,u4411,ADAM,Reggie -- please believe me!
105271,m293,charade,L126879,u4421,REGGIE,Then who did? You're the only one left.
105272,m293,charade,L126878,u4411,ADAM,But I didn't kill anybody.
105273,m293,charade,L126877,u4421,REGGIE,I'm through listening to you!
105274,m293,charade,L126876,u4411,ADAM,Reggie -- why won't you listen?
105275,m293,charade,L126848,u4411,ADAM,Don't be an idiot!
105276,m293,charade,L126847,u4421,REGGIE,But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
105277,m293,charade,L126846,u4411,ADAM,I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
105278,m293,charade,L126845,u4421,REGGIE,Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
105279,m293,charade,L126844,u4411,ADAM,Reggie -- stop!
105280,m293,charade,L126756,u4411,ADAM,Look.
105281,m293,charade,L126755,u4421,REGGIE,Tex? You mean he's here too?
105282,m293,charade,L126754,u4411,ADAM,It's all right -- I don't think Tex does either.
105283,m293,charade,L126753,u4421,REGGIE,It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
105284,m293,charade,L126752,u4411,ADAM,Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
105285,m293,charade,L126751,u4421,REGGIE,Well you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
105286,m293,charade,L126750,u4411,ADAM,I know but this is all we've got left.
105287,m293,charade,L126749,u4421,REGGIE,But Charles' appointment was last week not --
105288,m293,charade,L126748,u4411,ADAM,Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
105289,m293,charade,L126747,u4421,REGGIE,Now what?
105290,m293,charade,L126746,u4411,ADAM,It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
105291,m293,charade,L126745,u4421,REGGIE,as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
105292,m293,charade,L126742,u4421,REGGIE,Well -- it was a place -- a street corner I think. But I don't --  Hold it. I'm on.
105293,m293,charade,L126741,u4411,ADAM,There is? Well I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
105294,m293,charade,L126740,u4421,REGGIE,Of course there is!
105295,m293,charade,L126739,u4411,ADAM,Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
105296,m293,charade,L126738,u4421,REGGIE,That money's not ours Adam -- if we keep it we'll be breaking the law.
105297,m293,charade,L126737,u4411,ADAM,Think Reggie you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
105298,m293,charade,L126736,u4421,REGGIE,I think it only said where -- but I can't --
105299,m293,charade,L126735,u4411,ADAM,With whom? Where?
105300,m293,charade,L126734,u4421,REGGIE,Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
105301,m293,charade,L126733,u4411,ADAM,Can you remember anything at all?
105302,m293,charade,L126732,u4421,REGGIE,You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least nothing that the police thought was very important.
105303,m293,charade,L126729,u4411,ADAM,Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.
105304,m293,charade,L126728,u4421,REGGIE,No it's all right. What's wrong Adam?
105305,m293,charade,L126727,u4411,ADAM,Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
105306,m293,charade,L126719,u4411,ADAM,Yes you told me.
105307,m293,charade,L126718,u4421,REGGIE,I love you Adam.
105308,m293,charade,L126717,u4411,ADAM,Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
105309,m293,charade,L126716,u4421,REGGIE,Well I guess that's it -- dead end.
105310,m293,charade,L126715,u4411,ADAM,Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
105311,m293,charade,L126714,u4421,REGGIE,The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
105312,m293,charade,L126713,u4411,ADAM,It still doesn't make sense but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
105313,m293,charade,L126710,u4411,ADAM,The letter --
105314,m293,charade,L126709,u4421,REGGIE,To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
105315,m293,charade,L126708,u4411,ADAM,Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
105316,m293,charade,L126704,u4411,ADAM,I mean it's there Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.
105317,m293,charade,L126703,u4421,REGGIE,Lord you're stubborn.
105318,m293,charade,L126702,u4411,ADAM,Let's look anyway.
105319,m293,charade,L126701,u4421,REGGIE,But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
105320,m293,charade,L126699,u4411,ADAM,I sure am. Get it.
105321,m293,charade,L126698,u4421,REGGIE,Lord you're stubborn.
105322,m293,charade,L126697,u4411,ADAM,Where's that airlines bag?
105323,m293,charade,L126696,u4421,REGGIE,I've looked Adam -- you know I have --
105324,m293,charade,L126695,u4411,ADAM,I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
105325,m293,charade,L126694,u4421,REGGIE,Why?
105326,m293,charade,L126693,u4411,ADAM,I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
105327,m293,charade,L126692,u4411,ADAM,Open up.
105328,m293,charade,L126691,u4421,REGGIE,What is it?
105329,m293,charade,L126686,u4411,ADAM,There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.
105330,m293,charade,L126685,u4421,REGGIE,Adam --
105331,m293,charade,L126684,u4411,ADAM,If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us are they?
105332,m293,charade,L126683,u4421,REGGIE,You're going to look for him -- now?
105333,m293,charade,L126682,u4411,ADAM,That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
105334,m293,charade,L126666,u4411,ADAM,Relax -- you're gaining.
105335,m293,charade,L126665,u4421,REGGIE,I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
105336,m293,charade,L126664,u4421,REGGIE,Well -- come on.
105337,m293,charade,L126663,u4411,ADAM,When you come on you really come on.
105338,m293,charade,L126662,u4411,ADAM,No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
105339,m293,charade,L126661,u4421,REGGIE,Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
105340,m293,charade,L126660,u4411,ADAM,How do you think I got here?
105341,m293,charade,L126659,u4421,REGGIE,Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
105342,m293,charade,L126658,u4411,ADAM,Pretty good huh? I taught them everything they do.
105343,m293,charade,L126657,u4421,REGGIE,I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
105344,m293,charade,L126656,u4411,ADAM,Why do you think I brought you here?
105345,m293,charade,L126655,u4421,REGGIE,You don't look so bad in this light.
105346,m293,charade,L126654,u4411,ADAM,It's all right -- look.
105347,m293,charade,L126653,u4421,REGGIE,Adam!
105348,m293,charade,L126652,u4421,REGGIE,I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
105349,m293,charade,L126651,u4411,ADAM,What's the matter?
105350,m293,charade,L126650,u4411,ADAM,It's lovely.
105351,m293,charade,L126649,u4421,REGGIE,What about it?
105352,m293,charade,L126648,u4411,ADAM,Oh you should see your face.
105353,m293,charade,L126647,u4411,ADAM,Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
105354,m293,charade,L126646,u4421,REGGIE,What?
105355,m293,charade,L126645,u4411,ADAM,It's a toss-up I can tell you that.
105356,m293,charade,L126644,u4421,REGGIE,No -- I guess not.
105357,m293,charade,L126643,u4411,ADAM,What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
105358,m293,charade,L126642,u4421,REGGIE,Oh!
105359,m293,charade,L126641,u4411,ADAM,That's right.
105360,m293,charade,L126640,u4421,REGGIE,All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
105361,m293,charade,L126639,u4411,ADAM,How was I leading you on?
105362,m293,charade,L126638,u4421,REGGIE,Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
105363,m293,charade,L126637,u4411,ADAM,I think that's what you ordered.
105364,m293,charade,L126636,u4421,REGGIE,I could eat a horse.
105365,m293,charade,L126633,u4411,ADAM,Yes but --
105366,m293,charade,L126632,u4421,REGGIE,Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
105367,m293,charade,L126631,u4411,ADAM,It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
105368,m293,charade,L126630,u4421,REGGIE,-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
105369,m293,charade,L126629,u4411,ADAM,Oh come on!
105370,m293,charade,L126839,u4421,REGGIE,Yes I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
105371,m293,charade,L126838,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry Mrs. Lampert.
105372,m293,charade,L126837,u4421,REGGIE,No I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
105373,m293,charade,L126836,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Calm down Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
105374,m293,charade,L126835,u4421,REGGIE,The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
105375,m293,charade,L126834,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Just a minute Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
105376,m293,charade,L126591,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,None whatsoever. Please Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
105377,m293,charade,L126590,u4421,REGGIE,Are you sure there's no mistake?
105378,m293,charade,L126589,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
105379,m293,charade,L126588,u4421,REGGIE,Go ahead Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
105380,m293,charade,L126587,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington Mrs. Lampert --
105381,m293,charade,L126586,u4421,REGGIE,Yes -- ?
105382,m293,charade,L126285,u4421,REGGIE,Agents.
105383,m293,charade,L126284,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides you said yourself women make the best spies.
105384,m293,charade,L126283,u4421,REGGIE,Me? Why me?
105385,m293,charade,L126282,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out don't you?
105386,m293,charade,L126281,u4421,REGGIE,Oh. Then who's this one?
105387,m293,charade,L126280,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,No Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
105388,m293,charade,L126279,u4421,REGGIE,But no one actually saw him die.
105389,m293,charade,L126278,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,No Mrs. Lampert.
105390,m293,charade,L126277,u4421,REGGIE,Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
105391,m293,charade,L126276,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
105392,m293,charade,L126275,u4421,REGGIE,Oh stop it. What do you want me to do?
105393,m293,charade,L126274,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,That's the spirit.
105394,m293,charade,L126273,u4421,REGGIE,Well if I'm going to die I might as well do it for my country.
105395,m293,charade,L126272,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,I wouldn't advise that Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
105396,m293,charade,L126271,u4421,REGGIE,I'm sorry Mr. Bartholomew but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
105397,m293,charade,L126270,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,C.I.A. Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
105398,m293,charade,L126269,u4421,REGGIE,But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
105399,m293,charade,L126268,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
105400,m293,charade,L126267,u4421,REGGIE,But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
105401,m293,charade,L126266,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base made their report and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
105402,m293,charade,L126263,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Scobie was able to travel but Carson Dyle was clearly dying so they --
105403,m293,charade,L126262,u4421,REGGIE,Please go on Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
105404,m293,charade,L126261,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
105405,m293,charade,L126256,u4421,REGGIE,May I have a cigarette please?
105406,m293,charade,L126255,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,By burying it and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
105407,m293,charade,L126254,u4421,REGGIE,Steal it how?
105408,m293,charade,L126253,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Yes. The five men. They were of course your husband Charles the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
105409,m293,charade,L126252,u4421,REGGIE,Go on please -- five men -- $250000 -- the French Underground --
105410,m293,charade,L126250,u4421,REGGIE,Can I at least keep the onion soup?
105411,m293,charade,L126249,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Mrs. Lampert I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
105412,m293,charade,L126248,u4421,REGGIE,Gratinée choucroute garnie salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
105413,m293,charade,L126247,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Café.
105414,m293,charade,L126244,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,In 1944 five members of the O.S.S. -- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men --
105415,m293,charade,L126243,u4421,REGGIE,Barely yes.
105416,m293,charade,L126242,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
105417,m293,charade,L126241,u4421,REGGIE,Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about.
105418,m293,charade,L126240,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
105419,m293,charade,L126239,u4421,REGGIE,Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
105420,m293,charade,L126236,u4421,REGGIE,You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
105421,m293,charade,L126235,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,There's only one Dyle connected with this affair Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
105422,m293,charade,L126234,u4421,REGGIE,Carson?
105423,m293,charade,L126233,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,That's not Carson Dyle.
105424,m293,charade,L126232,u4421,REGGIE,No what?
105425,m293,charade,L126231,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,No.
105426,m293,charade,L126230,u4421,REGGIE,Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome really.
105427,m293,charade,L126229,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Describe him.
105428,m293,charade,L126228,u4421,REGGIE,He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
105429,m293,charade,L126227,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,What does your Mr. Dyle look like Mrs. Lampert?
105430,m293,charade,L126226,u4421,REGGIE,Dyle or whatever his name is.
105431,m293,charade,L126225,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Who?
105432,m293,charade,L126224,u4421,REGGIE,He has a gun Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
105433,m293,charade,L126223,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Agents.
105434,m293,charade,L126222,u4421,REGGIE,Yes but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
105435,m293,charade,L126221,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Were you followed?
105436,m293,charade,L126220,u4421,REGGIE,What did you want to see me about Mr. Bartholomew?
105437,m293,charade,L126206,u4421,REGGIE,Yes where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
105438,m293,charade,L126205,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
105439,m293,charade,L126204,u4421,REGGIE,You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
105440,m293,charade,L126203,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
105441,m293,charade,L126014,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Like I said Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
105442,m293,charade,L126013,u4421,REGGIE,Oh.
105443,m293,charade,L126012,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Because they're still here.
105444,m293,charade,L126011,u4421,REGGIE,Why not?
105445,m293,charade,L126010,u4421,REGGIE,Well there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
105446,m293,charade,L126009,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,We've no proof of course but we rather think so yes.
105447,m293,charade,L126008,u4421,REGGIE,Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles don't you?
105448,m293,charade,L126007,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
105449,m293,charade,L126006,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Look for it Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
105450,m293,charade,L126005,u4421,REGGIE,But --
105451,m293,charade,L126004,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Or a safe deposit key a certified check a baggage claim -- you look for it Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
105452,m293,charade,L126003,u4421,REGGIE,You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
105453,m293,charade,L126002,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Nevertheless Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
105454,m293,charade,L126001,u4421,REGGIE,Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars believe me I'd know it.
105455,m293,charade,L126000,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Oh you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
105456,m293,charade,L125999,u4421,REGGIE,Thanks very much.
105457,m293,charade,L125998,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,I believe you.
105458,m293,charade,L125997,u4421,REGGIE,I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
105459,m293,charade,L125996,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
105460,m293,charade,L125995,u4421,REGGIE,But I don't have it.
105461,m293,charade,L125994,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,And I'm afraid we want it back.
105462,m293,charade,L125993,u4421,REGGIE,Oh I see.
105463,m293,charade,L125992,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Ours.
105464,m293,charade,L125991,u4421,REGGIE,Then whose is it? His or theirs?
105465,m293,charade,L125990,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Oh Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh dear.
105466,m293,charade,L125989,u4421,REGGIE,But it's Charles's money not theirs.
105467,m293,charade,L125988,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Oh haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it too -- they want it very badly.
105468,m293,charade,L125987,u4421,REGGIE,Gladly only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
105469,m293,charade,L125986,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Please do what we ask Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
105470,m293,charade,L125985,u4421,REGGIE,Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
105471,m293,charade,L125984,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
105472,m293,charade,L125983,u4421,REGGIE,Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
105473,m293,charade,L125982,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Mrs. Lampert I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
105474,m293,charade,L125966,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Yes -- and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look.
105475,m293,charade,L125965,u4421,REGGIE,Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
105476,m293,charade,L125964,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Aren't they?  Now look at this one Mrs. Voss and --
105477,m293,charade,L125963,u4421,REGGIE,Very sweet.
105478,m293,charade,L125962,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Voss -- Charles Voss. All right Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph please -- by the way you saw this one didn't you?  Scott Cathy and Ham Jr.
105479,m293,charade,L125961,u4421,REGGIE,His -- real -- ?
105480,m293,charade,L125960,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Yes. We knew him of course by his real name.
105481,m293,charade,L125959,u4421,REGGIE,So that was it.
105482,m293,charade,L125958,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,To be more specific he was wanted by this agency.
105483,m293,charade,L125957,u4421,REGGIE,May I have a sandwich please?
105484,m293,charade,L125956,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
105485,m293,charade,L125955,u4421,REGGIE,What's all this got to do with me Mr. Bartholomew?
105486,m293,charade,L125954,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
105487,m293,charade,L125953,u4421,REGGIE,Agent.
105488,m293,charade,L125952,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,I'm not an agent Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
105489,m293,charade,L125951,u4421,REGGIE,I'm sorry it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
105490,m293,charade,L125950,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Someone has to do it Mrs. Lampert --
105491,m293,charade,L125949,u4421,REGGIE,We? You mean you're --?
105492,m293,charade,L125948,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Only we call them agents.
105493,m293,charade,L125947,u4421,REGGIE,You mean spies and things like that?
105494,m293,charade,L125946,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
105495,m293,charade,L125945,u4421,REGGIE,I don't suppose it's an airline is it?
105496,m293,charade,L125944,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Do you know what C.I.A. is Mrs. Lampert?
105497,m293,charade,L125943,u4421,REGGIE,No thanks.
105498,m293,charade,L125942,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Have some please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
105499,m293,charade,L125940,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?  Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.
105500,m293,charade,L125939,u4421,REGGIE,Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
105501,m293,charade,L125938,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Dry-cleaningwise things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
105502,m293,charade,L125936,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,Come in Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
105503,m293,charade,L125935,u4421,REGGIE,Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
105504,m293,charade,L125934,u4412,BARTHOLOMEW,I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
105521,m293,charade,L126977,u4421,REGGIE,You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
105523,m293,charade,L126975,u4421,REGGIE,You can't prove it can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
105525,m293,charade,L126973,u4421,REGGIE,You'd lie about anything.
105527,m293,charade,L126971,u4421,REGGIE,Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
105529,m293,charade,L126969,u4421,REGGIE,Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
105531,m293,charade,L126967,u4421,REGGIE,Oh.
105533,m293,charade,L126965,u4421,REGGIE,But you're -- divorced?
105535,m293,charade,L126963,u4421,REGGIE,Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
105537,m293,charade,L126961,u4421,REGGIE,Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
105539,m293,charade,L126959,u4421,REGGIE,What's your first name today?
105541,m293,charade,L126957,u4421,REGGIE,Starting with his own.
105543,m293,charade,L126955,u4421,REGGIE,Bartholomew?
105545,m293,charade,L126953,u4421,REGGIE,Then how do I know this is your office?
105547,m293,charade,L126951,u4421,REGGIE,Around one.
105549,m293,charade,L126949,u4421,REGGIE,Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here anyway?
105551,m293,charade,L126947,u4421,REGGIE,You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
105553,m293,charade,L126945,u4421,REGGIE,Well of all the mean rotten contemptible crooked --
105555,m293,charade,L126451,u4415,DYLE,We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
105556,m293,charade,L126450,u4415,DYLE,What's wrong Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
105558,m293,charade,L126446,u4415,DYLE,It's all right with us --
105560,m293,charade,L126442,u4415,DYLE,But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here pretending to look for the money waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
105562,m293,charade,L126438,u4415,DYLE,Or you --  Or you --
105564,m293,charade,L126436,u4415,DYLE,I don't know Herman -- maybe you do.
105566,m293,charade,L126434,u4415,DYLE,And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
105568,m293,charade,L126335,u4415,DYLE,Back where?
105570,m293,charade,L126332,u4415,DYLE,Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
105572,m293,charade,L126330,u4415,DYLE,Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
105574,m293,charade,L126328,u4415,DYLE,Very pretty. Now what?
105575,m293,charade,L126327,u4415,DYLE,The view had better be worth it.
105578,m293,charade,L126324,u4415,DYLE,Do I knock or something?
105580,m293,charade,L126322,u4415,DYLE,Sorry about that.
105582,m293,charade,L126320,u4415,DYLE,How long do you intend -- ?
105584,m293,charade,L126318,u4415,DYLE,What now?
105585,m293,charade,L126314,u4415,DYLE,You'll wreck your raincoat.
105587,m293,charade,L126628,u4421,REGGIE,No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains charm education a handsome face --
105588,m293,charade,L126627,u4415,DYLE,The man's the same even if the name isn't.
105589,m293,charade,L126626,u4421,REGGIE,Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
105590,m293,charade,L126625,u4415,DYLE,Sorry the name's Adam Canfield.
105591,m293,charade,L126624,u4421,REGGIE,But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
105592,m293,charade,L126623,u4415,DYLE,Well I can't really blame you -- not now.
105593,m293,charade,L126622,u4421,REGGIE,I don't believe it.
105594,m293,charade,L126621,u4415,DYLE,Well it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
105595,m293,charade,L126620,u4421,REGGIE,You mean you're a thief?
105596,m293,charade,L126619,u4415,DYLE,When a man has no profession except the one he loathes what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
105597,m293,charade,L126618,u4421,REGGIE,What do you mean?
105598,m293,charade,L126617,u4415,DYLE,It led me away from umbrella frames for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
105599,m293,charade,L126616,u4421,REGGIE,I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
105600,m293,charade,L126615,u4415,DYLE,After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business I suppose but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
105601,m293,charade,L126614,u4421,REGGIE,Go on.
105602,m293,charade,L126613,u4415,DYLE,Are you going to listen?
105603,m293,charade,L126612,u4421,REGGIE,Well!
105604,m293,charade,L126611,u4415,DYLE,Why don't you shut up!
105605,m293,charade,L126610,u4421,REGGIE,Fiction or non-fiction?
105606,m293,charade,L126609,u4415,DYLE,Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
105607,m293,charade,L126608,u4421,REGGIE,I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
105608,m293,charade,L126607,u4415,DYLE,I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
105609,m293,charade,L126606,u4421,REGGIE,Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
105610,m293,charade,L126605,u4415,DYLE,I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
105611,m293,charade,L126604,u4421,REGGIE,It's a start anyway.
105612,m293,charade,L126603,u4415,DYLE,What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
105613,m293,charade,L126602,u4415,DYLE,Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?
105614,m293,charade,L126601,u4421,REGGIE,But then if we sit back and wait the field should start narrowing down shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination wouldn't you say so?
105615,m293,charade,L126600,u4415,DYLE,No -- not yet.
105616,m293,charade,L126599,u4421,REGGIE,How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right haven't I? You don't know who did it.
105617,m293,charade,L126598,u4415,DYLE,Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
105618,m293,charade,L126597,u4421,REGGIE,I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
105619,m293,charade,L126596,u4415,DYLE,Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
105620,m293,charade,L126583,u4421,REGGIE,I don't believe it.
105621,m293,charade,L126582,u4415,DYLE,Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
105622,m293,charade,L126581,u4421,REGGIE,How often do you go through this little ritual?
105623,m293,charade,L126580,u4415,DYLE,The suit needs it more than I do anyway.
105624,m293,charade,L126577,u4415,DYLE,I don't think I know that one.
105625,m293,charade,L126576,u4421,REGGIE,Shut the door!
105626,m293,charade,L126575,u4415,DYLE,I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
105627,m293,charade,L126574,u4415,DYLE,Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
105628,m293,charade,L126573,u4421,REGGIE,What are you doing?
105629,m293,charade,L126572,u4421,REGGIE,I dare you.
105630,m293,charade,L126571,u4415,DYLE,Then I suggest you call one of them.
105631,m293,charade,L126570,u4421,REGGIE,This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
105632,m293,charade,L126569,u4415,DYLE,Reggie -- open the door.
105633,m293,charade,L126568,u4421,REGGIE,The shower's in there.
105634,m293,charade,L126567,u4415,DYLE,Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
105635,m293,charade,L126566,u4421,REGGIE,Got you.
105636,m293,charade,L126555,u4415,DYLE,Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
105637,m293,charade,L126554,u4421,REGGIE,Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
105638,m293,charade,L126552,u4421,REGGIE,No --
105639,m293,charade,L126551,u4415,DYLE,What? Assassinate somebody?
105640,m293,charade,L126550,u4421,REGGIE,First your brother then Charles now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
105641,m293,charade,L126549,u4415,DYLE,Yes I know.
105642,m293,charade,L126548,u4421,REGGIE,What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all Alex -- that means we're in his way too.
105643,m293,charade,L126547,u4415,DYLE,Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
105644,m293,charade,L126546,u4421,REGGIE,No about Scobie I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
105645,m293,charade,L126545,u4415,DYLE,Don't worry I'm not going to hit you.
105646,m293,charade,L126544,u4421,REGGIE,I'm scared.
105647,m293,charade,L126543,u4415,DYLE,Hm?
105648,m293,charade,L126542,u4421,REGGIE,Alex --
105649,m293,charade,L126541,u4415,DYLE,No sense messing up the streets.
105650,m293,charade,L126540,u4421,REGGIE,I'm sorry.
105651,m293,charade,L126539,u4415,DYLE,I'd love some thanks.
105652,m293,charade,L126538,u4421,REGGIE,No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good want some?
105653,m293,charade,L126537,u4415,DYLE,What -- like Scobie?
105654,m293,charade,L126536,u4421,REGGIE,Women. You know I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
105655,m293,charade,L126535,u4415,DYLE,Who?
105656,m293,charade,L126534,u4421,REGGIE,Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
105657,m293,charade,L126533,u4415,DYLE,A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
105658,m293,charade,L126532,u4421,REGGIE,What's so illogical about that?
105659,m293,charade,L126531,u4415,DYLE,Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
105660,m293,charade,L126530,u4421,REGGIE,Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
105661,m293,charade,L126529,u4415,DYLE,Why?
105662,m293,charade,L126528,u4421,REGGIE,I think Tex did it.
105663,m293,charade,L126526,u4421,REGGIE,You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
105664,m293,charade,L126525,u4415,DYLE,Maybe.
105665,m293,charade,L126524,u4421,REGGIE,Or Tex?
105666,m293,charade,L126523,u4415,DYLE,Maybe.
105667,m293,charade,L126522,u4421,REGGIE,Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
105668,m293,charade,L126495,u4421,REGGIE,No.
105669,m293,charade,L126494,u4415,DYLE,Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
105670,m293,charade,L126457,u4421,REGGIE,Viens Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
105671,m293,charade,L126456,u4415,DYLE,He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
105672,m293,charade,L126455,u4421,REGGIE,Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
105673,m293,charade,L126454,u4415,DYLE,Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
105674,m293,charade,L126427,u4421,REGGIE,I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
105675,m293,charade,L126426,u4415,DYLE,Hello Herman it was a happy landing I see.
105676,m293,charade,L126415,u4415,DYLE,I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
105677,m293,charade,L126414,u4421,REGGIE,Lord I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy would they?
105678,m293,charade,L126413,u4415,DYLE,Tuesday.
105679,m293,charade,L126412,u4421,REGGIE,What day is it?
105680,m293,charade,L126410,u4421,REGGIE,I'll be right there.
105681,m293,charade,L126409,u4415,DYLE,That sounds like their problem.
105682,m293,charade,L126408,u4421,REGGIE,They've got Jean-Louis!
105683,m293,charade,L126403,u4421,REGGIE,Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
105684,m293,charade,L126402,u4415,DYLE,The phone's ringing --
105685,m293,charade,L126401,u4421,REGGIE,I think I love you Alex --
105686,m293,charade,L126400,u4415,DYLE,Now please Reggie -- cut it out.
105687,m293,charade,L126399,u4421,REGGIE,Oh. 
105688,m293,charade,L126398,u4415,DYLE,But I'm not through complaining yet.
105689,m293,charade,L126397,u4421,REGGIE,You did.
105690,m293,charade,L126396,u4415,DYLE,Who told you to do that?
105691,m293,charade,L126395,u4421,REGGIE,Cutting it out.
105692,m293,charade,L126394,u4415,DYLE,What are you doing?
105693,m293,charade,L126393,u4421,REGGIE,Okay.
105694,m293,charade,L126392,u4415,DYLE,Now please Reggie -- cut it out.
105695,m293,charade,L126391,u4421,REGGIE,Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
105696,m293,charade,L126390,u4415,DYLE,Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
105697,m293,charade,L126389,u4421,REGGIE,Said what?
105698,m293,charade,L126388,u4415,DYLE,There you said it.
105699,m293,charade,L126387,u4421,REGGIE,Why can't you be serious?
105700,m293,charade,L126386,u4415,DYLE,Well there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
105701,m293,charade,L126385,u4421,REGGIE,I'm not fifteen.
105702,m293,charade,L126384,u4415,DYLE,So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
105703,m293,charade,L126383,u4421,REGGIE,Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
105704,m293,charade,L126382,u4415,DYLE,Reggie -- listen to me --
105705,m293,charade,L126381,u4421,REGGIE,I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
105706,m293,charade,L126379,u4421,REGGIE,Come here.
105707,m293,charade,L126378,u4415,DYLE,Whitefoot of course.
105708,m293,charade,L126377,u4421,REGGIE,Which one are you?
105709,m293,charade,L126376,u4415,DYLE,Why not a lying Blackfoot?
105710,m293,charade,L126375,u4421,REGGIE,Oh. Well then he's a truthful Whitefoot of course.
105711,m293,charade,L126374,u4415,DYLE,Because he's wearing moccasins.
105712,m293,charade,L126373,u4421,REGGIE,Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
105713,m293,charade,L126372,u4415,DYLE,There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot but which one is he?
105714,m293,charade,L126371,u4421,REGGIE,There must be some way.
105715,m293,charade,L126370,u4415,DYLE,You can't.
105716,m293,charade,L126369,u4421,REGGIE,Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
105717,m293,charade,L126368,u4415,DYLE,I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth but I had to find out your part in all this.
105718,m293,charade,L126367,u4421,REGGIE,There -- you're a new man.
105719,m293,charade,L126366,u4415,DYLE,I'm no easier to live with than he was.
105720,m293,charade,L126365,u4421,REGGIE,I thought that was Peter Joshua.
105721,m293,charade,L126364,u4415,DYLE,Yes but we're divorced.
105722,m293,charade,L126363,u4421,REGGIE,Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
105723,m293,charade,L126362,u4415,DYLE,Alexander.
105724,m293,charade,L126361,u4421,REGGIE,Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
105725,m293,charade,L126360,u4415,DYLE,Okay I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
105726,m293,charade,L126359,u4421,REGGIE,Sure.
105727,m293,charade,L126358,u4415,DYLE,Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
105728,m293,charade,L126357,u4421,REGGIE,Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
105729,m293,charade,L126356,u4415,DYLE,Would you like to see my passport?
105730,m293,charade,L126355,u4421,REGGIE,Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
105731,m293,charade,L126354,u4415,DYLE,Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
105732,m293,charade,L126353,u4421,REGGIE,Does it hurt?
105733,m293,charade,L126352,u4421,REGGIE,It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but then you can lie from any position can't you?
105734,m293,charade,L126351,u4415,DYLE,Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
105735,m293,charade,L126349,u4421,REGGIE,Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.
105736,m293,charade,L126348,u4415,DYLE,I left him hanging around the American Express.
105737,m293,charade,L126347,u4421,REGGIE,Scobie?
105738,m293,charade,L126346,u4415,DYLE,I met a man with sharp nails.
105739,m293,charade,L126345,u4421,REGGIE,Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
105740,m293,charade,L126312,u4421,REGGIE,How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh I want to believe you Peter... oh but I can't call you that anymore can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ?
105741,m293,charade,L126311,u4415,DYLE,The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans but I think they did it -- Tex Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not and that's the truth. I'm on your side Reggie -- please believe that.
105742,m293,charade,L126310,u4421,REGGIE,Your --
105743,m293,charade,L126309,u4415,DYLE,Yes he is. He was my brother.
105744,m293,charade,L126308,u4421,REGGIE,Carson Dyle is dead.
105745,m293,charade,L126307,u4415,DYLE,But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
105746,m293,charade,L126306,u4421,REGGIE,Well you know now so please tell me who you are.
105747,m293,charade,L126305,u4415,DYLE,I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
105748,m293,charade,L126304,u4421,REGGIE,Why you lied to me.
105749,m293,charade,L126303,u4415,DYLE,No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
105750,m293,charade,L126302,u4421,REGGIE,It's the only name I've got. How about you?
105751,m293,charade,L126301,u4415,DYLE,Reggie?
105752,m293,charade,L126300,u4421,REGGIE,Good morning Mr. Dyle.
105754,m293,charade,L126829,u4421,REGGIE,I'm -- I'm sorry.

105757,m293,charade,L126826,u4421,REGGIE,Here's ten.
105759,m293,charade,L126824,u4421,REGGIE,You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now?
105761,m293,charade,L126822,u4421,REGGIE,And the last one?
105763,m293,charade,L126820,u4421,REGGIE,Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
105765,m293,charade,L126818,u4421,REGGIE,In money.
105767,m293,charade,L126816,u4421,REGGIE,What's its value today?
105769,m293,charade,L126814,u4421,REGGIE,Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
105771,m293,charade,L126812,u4421,REGGIE,I'm afraid it is important.
105773,m293,charade,L126810,u4421,REGGIE,How much is it worth?
105775,m293,charade,L126808,u4421,REGGIE,I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
105778,m293,charade,L126804,u4421,REGGIE,Yes.
105780,m293,charade,L126802,u4421,REGGIE,Monsieur Félix -- ?
105801,m293,charade,L126429,u4421,REGGIE,But his mother --
105803,m293,charade,L126055,u4421,REGGIE,Stop it!
105805,m293,charade,L126053,u4421,REGGIE,Leave me alone -- !
105807,m293,charade,L126051,u4421,REGGIE,I don't know anything.
105809,m293,charade,L126049,u4421,REGGIE,Tell me what?
105811,m293,charade,L126047,u4421,REGGIE,What do you want?
105814,m293,charade,L126679,u4421,REGGIE,No -- in my room.
105816,m293,charade,L126677,u4421,REGGIE,I was too.
105818,m293,charade,L125879,u4421,REGGIE,I don't understand.
105820,m293,charade,L125877,u4421,REGGIE,Of course it is.
105822,m293,charade,L125875,u4421,REGGIE,Is that all? Can I go now?
105825,m293,charade,L125872,u4421,REGGIE,Did you?
105827,m293,charade,L125869,u4421,REGGIE,A letter? May I see it?
105829,m293,charade,L125867,u4421,REGGIE,I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
105830,m293,charade,L125862,u4421,REGGIE,I wish you wouldn't.
105833,m293,charade,L125859,u4421,REGGIE,I know.  I'm sorry.
105835,m293,charade,L125857,u4421,REGGIE,I don't know.
105837,m293,charade,L125855,u4421,REGGIE,I don't know.
105839,m293,charade,L125853,u4421,REGGIE,I don't know.
105841,m293,charade,L125851,u4421,REGGIE,I don't know. I suppose so.
105843,m293,charade,L125849,u4421,REGGIE,He didn't have one.
105845,m293,charade,L125847,u4421,REGGIE,Swiss.
105847,m293,charade,L125845,u4421,REGGIE,I'm very confused.
105849,m293,charade,L125843,u4421,REGGIE,Leave?
105851,m293,charade,L125841,u4421,REGGIE,I'm very cold.
105854,m293,charade,L125836,u4421,REGGIE,Yes.
105856,m293,charade,L126794,u4421,REGGIE,I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
105858,m293,charade,L126789,u4421,REGGIE,Oh no! What man Jean-Louis --  where?
105860,m293,charade,L126787,u4421,REGGIE,Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
105861,m293,charade,L126499,u4421,REGGIE,No Jean-Louis.
105864,m293,charade,L126490,u4421,REGGIE,If you think you're getting credit for this you're crazy.
105866,m293,charade,L126488,u4421,REGGIE,I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
105868,m293,charade,L126485,u4421,REGGIE,Voilŕ what?
105870,m293,charade,L126483,u4421,REGGIE,Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
105872,m293,charade,L126481,u4421,REGGIE,Come on now -- if you wanted to hide something where would you put it?
105873,m293,charade,L126459,u4421,REGGIE,What should we give him?
105876,m293,charade,L125829,u4421,REGGIE,-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here okay?
105878,m293,charade,L125763,u4421,REGGIE,Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
105880,m293,charade,L126200,u4420,PETER,Good night.
105881,m293,charade,L126199,u4421,REGGIE,Yes I'll remember. Good night.
105882,m293,charade,L126198,u4420,PETER,Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
105883,m293,charade,L126197,u4421,REGGIE,Don't put yourself out.
105884,m293,charade,L126196,u4420,PETER,Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
105885,m293,charade,L126195,u4421,REGGIE,Words can hurt very much.
105886,m293,charade,L126194,u4420,PETER,You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
105887,m293,charade,L126193,u4421,REGGIE,What are you talking about?
105888,m293,charade,L126192,u4420,PETER,I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money or know where it is or have it without knowing where it is or don't even know you have it --
105889,m293,charade,L126191,u4421,REGGIE,How do you know what they're doing?
105890,m293,charade,L126190,u4420,PETER,They're only trying to scare you that's all.
105891,m293,charade,L126189,u4421,REGGIE,I believe what he said.
105892,m293,charade,L126188,u4420,PETER,I wouldn't take that too seriously.
105893,m293,charade,L126187,u4421,REGGIE,He -- he said if I didn't give the money he'll kill me.
105894,m293,charade,L126186,u4420,PETER,What'd he say?
105895,m293,charade,L126184,u4420,PETER,What is it Reggie -- what's he saying?
105896,m293,charade,L126183,u4421,REGGIE,Yes -- that's right.
105897,m293,charade,L126179,u4421,REGGIE,The man you had the fight with.
105898,m293,charade,L126178,u4420,PETER,Who is it?
105899,m293,charade,L126174,u4421,REGGIE,Do you tell lies?
105900,m293,charade,L126173,u4420,PETER,Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
105901,m293,charade,L126172,u4421,REGGIE,Peter you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
105902,m293,charade,L126171,u4420,PETER,That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
105903,m293,charade,L126170,u4421,REGGIE,I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
105904,m293,charade,L126169,u4420,PETER,Of course I'll help -- I told you I would didn't I? Come on now --
105905,m293,charade,L126168,u4421,REGGIE,Please help me Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
105906,m293,charade,L126167,u4420,PETER,No they won't -- I won't let them.
105907,m293,charade,L126166,u4421,REGGIE,But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
105908,m293,charade,L126165,u4420,PETER,So they think he left it with you.
105909,m293,charade,L126164,u4421,REGGIE,I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
105910,m293,charade,L126163,u4420,PETER,No it isn't -- where's the money?
105911,m293,charade,L126162,u4421,REGGIE,That's all.
105912,m293,charade,L126161,u4420,PETER,Go on.
105913,m293,charade,L126160,u4421,REGGIE,A quarter of a million dollars.
105914,m293,charade,L126159,u4420,PETER,What?
105915,m293,charade,L126158,u4421,REGGIE,There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
105916,m293,charade,L126157,u4420,PETER,There was no trace of him. All right Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
105917,m293,charade,L126125,u4420,PETER,You took the words right out of my mouth.
105918,m293,charade,L126124,u4421,REGGIE,Be careful Peter.
105919,m293,charade,L126123,u4420,PETER,Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
105920,m293,charade,L126122,u4421,REGGIE,Out of the window I guess -- I didn't see him.
105921,m293,charade,L126121,u4420,PETER,I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
105922,m293,charade,L126120,u4421,REGGIE,Peter -- are you all right?
105923,m293,charade,L126113,u4420,PETER,Good night.
105924,m293,charade,L126112,u4421,REGGIE,Nothing. Good night.
105925,m293,charade,L126111,u4420,PETER,What?
105926,m293,charade,L126110,u4421,REGGIE,Do you know what's wrong with you?
105927,m293,charade,L126109,u4420,PETER,Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise it's late I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
105928,m293,charade,L126108,u4421,REGGIE,How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
105929,m293,charade,L126107,u4420,PETER,How would you like a spanking?
105930,m293,charade,L126106,u4421,REGGIE,Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry baby I never make promises I can't keep.'
105931,m293,charade,L126104,u4421,REGGIE,How about once more around the park?
105932,m293,charade,L126103,u4420,PETER,On the street where you live.
105933,m293,charade,L126102,u4421,REGGIE,Where?
105934,m293,charade,L126101,u4420,PETER,We're here.
105935,m293,charade,L126100,u4420,PETER,Don't you know I could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor?
105936,m293,charade,L126099,u4421,REGGIE,Look I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
105937,m293,charade,L126098,u4420,PETER,What your husband was mixed up in.
105938,m293,charade,L126097,u4421,REGGIE,What was what?
105939,m293,charade,L126096,u4420,PETER,What was it?
105940,m293,charade,L126095,u4421,REGGIE,How do you shave in there?
105941,m293,charade,L126094,u4420,PETER,You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
105942,m293,charade,L126087,u4421,REGGIE,Yes you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.
105943,m293,charade,L126086,u4420,PETER,I wasn't --
105944,m293,charade,L126085,u4421,REGGIE,Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
105945,m293,charade,L126084,u4420,PETER,Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
105946,m293,charade,L126083,u4421,REGGIE,That's what I'm not supposed to say.
105947,m293,charade,L126082,u4420,PETER,Who said?
105948,m293,charade,L126081,u4421,REGGIE,He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
105949,m293,charade,L126080,u4420,PETER,I don't think I follow you.
105950,m293,charade,L126079,u4421,REGGIE,I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
105951,m293,charade,L126078,u4420,PETER,You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
105952,m293,charade,L126077,u4421,REGGIE,Having a nervous breakdown.
105953,m293,charade,L126076,u4420,PETER,What are you doing in here?
105954,m293,charade,L126045,u4421,REGGIE,Lay on MacDuff.
105955,m293,charade,L126044,u4420,PETER,En garde.
105956,m293,charade,L126042,u4421,REGGIE,No everyone. Come on -- avanti avanti!
105957,m293,charade,L126041,u4420,PETER,You mean you and me?
105958,m293,charade,L126040,u4421,REGGIE,Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
105959,m293,charade,L126039,u4420,PETER,What was all that?
105960,m293,charade,L126037,u4421,REGGIE,Starting tonight?
105961,m293,charade,L126036,u4420,PETER,Right there between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
105962,m293,charade,L126033,u4421,REGGIE,He's only pretending to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
105963,m293,charade,L126032,u4420,PETER,Of course? I thought he was dead.
105964,m293,charade,L126022,u4421,REGGIE,The man and the woman are married --
105965,m293,charade,L126021,u4420,PETER,I'm still having trouble with English.
105966,m293,charade,L126020,u4421,REGGIE,Don't you understand French?
105967,m293,charade,L126019,u4420,PETER,What's going on?
105968,m293,charade,L126018,u4421,REGGIE,I'm sorry -- I heard the children laughing.
105969,m293,charade,L126017,u4420,PETER,You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
105970,m293,charade,L126016,u4421,REGGIE,Hallo Peter.
105971,m293,charade,L125903,u4420,PETER,Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
105972,m293,charade,L125902,u4421,REGGIE,Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
105973,m293,charade,L125901,u4420,PETER,We'll find you a hotel.
105974,m293,charade,L125900,u4421,REGGIE,I don't know where to go.
105975,m293,charade,L125899,u4420,PETER,Come on. You can't stay here.
105976,m293,charade,L125898,u4421,REGGIE,Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
105977,m293,charade,L125897,u4420,PETER,Instant divorce you mean?
105978,m293,charade,L125896,u4421,REGGIE,I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
105979,m293,charade,L125895,u4420,PETER,Doing what?
105980,m293,charade,L125894,u4421,REGGIE,Try and get my old job back at UNESCO I suppose.
105981,m293,charade,L125893,u4420,PETER,Do you know what you're going to do?
105982,m293,charade,L125892,u4421,REGGIE,Charles sold it all -- at auction.
105983,m293,charade,L125891,u4420,PETER,Where did everything go?
105984,m293,charade,L125889,u4421,REGGIE,Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
105985,m293,charade,L125888,u4420,PETER,I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
105986,m293,charade,L125887,u4421,REGGIE,Thank you.
105987,m293,charade,L125886,u4420,PETER,It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
105988,m293,charade,L125885,u4421,REGGIE,How did you find out?
105989,m293,charade,L125884,u4420,PETER,I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
105990,m293,charade,L125883,u4421,REGGIE,What are you doing here?
105991,m293,charade,L125822,u4420,PETER,Is there only one Charles Lampert?
105992,m293,charade,L125821,u4421,REGGIE,Charles is.
105993,m293,charade,L125820,u4420,PETER,Are you in the book?
105994,m293,charade,L125819,u4421,REGGIE,Well the idea's right anyway. Are you going to call me?
105995,m293,charade,L125818,u4420,PETER,It's terrible -- you just made it up.
105996,m293,charade,L125817,u4421,REGGIE,How do you know?
105997,m293,charade,L125816,u4420,PETER,Shakespeare never said that.
105998,m293,charade,L125814,u4420,PETER,No I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
105999,m293,charade,L125813,u4421,REGGIE,Now you're angry.
106000,m293,charade,L125812,u4420,PETER,Mr. Joshua.  Well I've enjoyed talking with you.
106001,m293,charade,L125811,u4421,REGGIE,Oh Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
106002,m293,charade,L125810,u4420,PETER,Is your husband with you?
106003,m293,charade,L125809,u4421,REGGIE,That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
106004,m293,charade,L125808,u4420,PETER,Yes but we're divorced.
106005,m293,charade,L125807,u4421,REGGIE,Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
106006,m293,charade,L125806,u4420,PETER,Oh. I guess.
106007,m293,charade,L125805,u4421,REGGIE,Well you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size but he says that the family size the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
106008,m293,charade,L125804,u4420,PETER,I'm not sure I --
106009,m293,charade,L125803,u4421,REGGIE,Yes I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
106010,m293,charade,L125802,u4420,PETER,Well you're honest anyway.
106011,m293,charade,L125801,u4421,REGGIE,No you see I don't really love him.
106012,m293,charade,L125800,u4420,PETER,Please not on my account.
106013,m293,charade,L125799,u4421,REGGIE,No it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
106014,m293,charade,L125798,u4420,PETER,Good for you.
106015,m293,charade,L125797,u4421,REGGIE,Yes.
106016,m293,charade,L125796,u4420,PETER,Is there a Mr. Lampert?
106017,m293,charade,L125795,u4421,REGGIE,I'm Regina Lampert.
106018,m293,charade,L125794,u4420,PETER,Peter Joshua.
106019,m293,charade,L125793,u4421,REGGIE,The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
106020,m293,charade,L125792,u4420,PETER,Sorry. Which view would you like?
106021,m293,charade,L125791,u4421,REGGIE,I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
106022,m293,charade,L125790,u4420,PETER,Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
106023,m293,charade,L125788,u4421,REGGIE,You give up awfully easy don't you?
106024,m293,charade,L125787,u4420,PETER,How's that?
106025,m293,charade,L125786,u4421,REGGIE,Quitter.
106026,m293,charade,L125785,u4420,PETER,Yes of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
106027,m293,charade,L125784,u4421,REGGIE,I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
106028,m293,charade,L125783,u4420,PETER,I don't know -- how would I know?
106029,m293,charade,L125782,u4421,REGGIE,Why do you think we're going to?
106030,m293,charade,L125781,u4420,PETER,He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other do we?
106031,m293,charade,L125780,u4421,REGGIE,It's hers. Where'd you find him robbing a bank?
106032,m293,charade,L125779,u4420,PETER,Oh forgive me.  Is this yours?
106034,m293,charade,L126406,u4421,REGGIE,Can you give me one good reason why I should?
106036,m293,charade,L126073,u4421,REGGIE,Please stop -- please!
106039,m293,charade,L126069,u4421,REGGIE,Stop that!
106041,m293,charade,L126065,u4421,REGGIE,No -- no I'm don't.
106043,m293,charade,L126063,u4421,REGGIE,Wha -- what do you want?
106045,m293,charade,L125921,u4421,REGGIE,I don't understa--
106047,m293,charade,L125919,u4421,REGGIE,Yes?
106050,m293,charade,L126780,u4421,REGGIE,I don't see him.
106051,m293,charade,L126779,u4421,REGGIE,A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to find him!
106053,m293,charade,L126777,u4421,REGGIE,Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
106055,m293,charade,L126775,u4421,REGGIE,Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
106057,m293,charade,L126773,u4421,REGGIE,I'm glad. But what's all this?
106059,m293,charade,L126771,u4421,REGGIE,What's he up to?
106061,m293,charade,L126769,u4421,REGGIE,Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
106063,m293,charade,L126724,u4421,REGGIE,Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
106065,m293,charade,L126722,u4421,REGGIE,I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
106066,m293,charade,L125927,u4421,REGGIE,I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
106068,m293,charade,L125925,u4421,REGGIE,The American Embassy.
106071,m293,charade,L125914,u4421,REGGIE,How can you tell?
106073,m293,charade,L125912,u4421,REGGIE,I've never seen him before.
106075,m293,charade,L125910,u4421,REGGIE,Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
106078,m293,charade,L125907,u4421,REGGIE,Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
106080,m293,charade,L125905,u4421,REGGIE,It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
106081,m293,charade,L125827,u4421,REGGIE,Don't you want me to stay?
106083,m293,charade,L125777,u4421,REGGIE,I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial
106086,m293,charade,L125774,u4421,REGGIE,Because I don't love him.
106088,m293,charade,L125771,u4421,REGGIE,I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable.
106090,m293,charade,L125769,u4421,REGGIE,He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work I really have -- but --
106092,m293,charade,L125767,u4421,REGGIE,Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
106094,m293,charade,L125764,u4421,REGGIE,Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
115931,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164864,u4828,JABEZ,Who are these people?
115933,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164824,u4828,JABEZ,What are those people doing there? What do they want?
115934,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164752,u4828,JABEZ,Oh --  Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady.  Get some wine for the Squire Belle.
115936,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164750,u4828,JABEZ,Hey you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
115937,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164746,u4828,JABEZ,The -- folks or people what's the difference among friends?
115940,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164656,u4828,JABEZ,We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me Belle.
115942,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164642,u4828,JABEZ,Golly Belle that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
115944,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164630,u4828,JABEZ,Let's dance together -- Belle.
115946,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164619,u4828,JABEZ,I'll take it.
115947,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164617,u4828,JABEZ,From over the mountain --
115949,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164845,u4831,MARY,That's my problem Belle.
115951,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164843,u4831,MARY,I know -- and you could show me the door. You would too if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
115953,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164841,u4831,MARY,Lying to you -- Why should I?
115955,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164839,u4831,MARY,I didn't.
115957,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164695,u4831,MARY,He lied to me again.
115959,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164626,u4831,MARY,Thank you Belle --
115961,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164624,u4831,MARY,No thank you -- what's your name?
115964,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164621,u4831,MARY,Jabez -- ?
115965,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164803,u4839,WEBSTER,No siree it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap Constitution -- and let's keep going Mr. Stone.
115967,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164801,u4839,WEBSTER,You're wrong Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country or the way they live is the country and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well I hope you'll meet all those when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them in a permanent way the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
115969,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164799,u4839,WEBSTER,Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
115971,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164797,u4839,WEBSTER,Maybe you can sometime Daniel. I'm a farmer you know and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most you'll have to see for yourself.
115973,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164795,u4839,WEBSTER,No Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise too and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine dignified horse though you do have to push him now and then.
115975,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164793,u4839,WEBSTER,It does hurt! And don't you do it again.
115977,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164791,u4839,WEBSTER,Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
115978,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164790,u4839,WEBSTER,And serve him right!
115980,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164788,u4839,WEBSTER,And what about Daniel Webster?
115982,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164786,u4839,WEBSTER,A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first Dan'l?
115984,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164784,u4839,WEBSTER,Young man -- you got me there.
115986,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164782,u4839,WEBSTER,Guess there will if it says so.
115988,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164780,u4839,WEBSTER,It hasn't opened yet?
115990,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164778,u4839,WEBSTER,All right Daniel. Jump in.
115992,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164776,u4839,WEBSTER,Hello Colonel! Want a lift?
115993,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164956,u4831,MARY,All right darling.
115995,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164954,u4831,MARY,Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
115998,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164822,u4831,MARY,Daniel you ought to be in bed.
115999,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164690,u4831,MARY,Daniel! ...  I've stood just about as much as I can bear!
116001,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164688,u4831,MARY,Daniel give me that beanshooter!
116003,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164686,u4831,MARY,Yes you did Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter Daniel!
116005,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164709,u4829,MA STONE,I see you! Riding pretty high ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
116008,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164684,u4829,MA STONE,Lan's to goodness what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
116009,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164683,u4829,MA STONE,That's just too bad --
116011,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164681,u4829,MA STONE,Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
116013,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164532,u4828,JABEZ,Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No sir... not me! ...
116016,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164528,u4828,JABEZ,Not at all Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
116018,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164526,u4828,JABEZ,Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
116020,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164524,u4828,JABEZ,I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
116022,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164522,u4828,JABEZ,Why of course Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
116024,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164520,u4828,JABEZ,Howdy Hank.
116027,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L165031,u4828,JABEZ,Why thank you Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
116029,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164291,u4828,JABEZ,I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
116032,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164286,u4828,JABEZ,What Grange?
116034,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164284,u4828,JABEZ,What do you want?
116035,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164204,u4828,JABEZ,Black Dan'l?
116037,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164202,u4828,JABEZ,I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
116039,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164200,u4828,JABEZ,Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
116041,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164193,u4828,JABEZ,Sure am.
116043,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164191,u4828,JABEZ,Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
116045,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164615,u4828,JABEZ,Belle --
116047,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164613,u4828,JABEZ,Never mind. What's your name?
116049,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164609,u4828,JABEZ,She couldn't be gone!
116051,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164607,u4828,JABEZ,You're not -- Dorothy.
116052,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164863,u4828,JABEZ,Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
116054,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164861,u4828,JABEZ,Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares anyhow?
116056,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164859,u4828,JABEZ,All right -- so it's buried with you!
116058,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164857,u4828,JABEZ,Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
116060,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164855,u4828,JABEZ,Are you plumb crazy man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
116062,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164853,u4828,JABEZ,Afraid ... of what?
116064,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164851,u4828,JABEZ,What's the matter with you?
116066,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164848,u4828,JABEZ,Almost seven.  No -- no he's not seven yet I am sure --
116068,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164846,u4828,JABEZ,Now run along Daniel.
116069,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164832,u4828,JABEZ,I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
116071,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164830,u4828,JABEZ,No you're not.
116073,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164661,u4828,JABEZ,Some other time Stevens.
116075,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164659,u4828,JABEZ,Hello Stevens ... you're early today.
116077,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164339,u4828,JABEZ,Doesn't satisfy eh? Well -- that's too bad....
116079,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164337,u4828,JABEZ,You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
116081,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164335,u4828,JABEZ,-- in gold.
116083,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164333,u4828,JABEZ,I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
116085,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164331,u4828,JABEZ,Stevens!
116086,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164997,u4833,SCRATCH,Gentlemen the prosecution rests.
116087,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164996,u4828,JABEZ,You know darn well it is.
116088,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164995,u4833,SCRATCH,But Mr. Stone I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
116089,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164994,u4828,JABEZ,Yes -- yes I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
116090,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164991,u4833,SCRATCH,That is highly irrelevant to this case Your Honor.
116091,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164990,u4828,JABEZ,Yes I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul in exchange for money. That was a lie a lie a lie.
116092,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164989,u4833,SCRATCH,Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
116093,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164952,u4828,JABEZ,Never!
116094,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164951,u4833,SCRATCH,Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
116095,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164950,u4828,JABEZ,About what?
116096,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164949,u4833,SCRATCH,Well now Mr. Stone did you make up your mind?
116097,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164909,u4833,SCRATCH,Come come Mr. Stone you are a little upset. It's not fair to bargain with you now. -- I'll give you until midnight Mr. Stone but not one minute more. Ah then you'll come with me indeed.
116098,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164908,u4828,JABEZ,No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
116099,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164907,u4833,SCRATCH,I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow your son ...
116100,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164906,u4828,JABEZ,Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
116101,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164905,u4833,SCRATCH,Suddenly you seem quite desperate Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
116102,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164904,u4828,JABEZ,Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
116103,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164903,u4833,SCRATCH,Oh no you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now if I chose.
116104,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164902,u4828,JABEZ,I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
116105,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164901,u4833,SCRATCH,What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
116106,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164900,u4828,JABEZ,I'm through with you.
116107,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164899,u4833,SCRATCH,Trying to break our contract again Mr. Stone?
116108,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164898,u4828,JABEZ,My time isn't up yet.
116109,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164897,u4833,SCRATCH,Small? Oh I see what you mean. Why they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster if I ever get hold of him I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that I imagine the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
116110,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164896,u4828,JABEZ,Are they all as -- small -- as that?
116111,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164894,u4833,SCRATCH,He was --
116112,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164893,u4828,JABEZ,He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
116113,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164892,u4833,SCRATCH,.... Miser Stevens' soul Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
116114,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164888,u4833,SCRATCH,Just a minute neighbor Stone. I promised you money and all that money can buy. I don't recall any other obligations. But let's look at the contract.
116115,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164887,u4828,JABEZ,You promised me prosperity happiness love money friendship --
116116,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164886,u4833,SCRATCH,Why Mr. Stone you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
116117,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164561,u4833,SCRATCH,Oh certainly. I shan't even come to the christening -- it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste.  But I may send a friend of mine -- just for old sake's sake. Yes I might do that.
116118,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164560,u4828,JABEZ,Leave your tongue off of that!
116119,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164559,u4833,SCRATCH,But you should now that you are becoming a father.
116120,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164558,u4828,JABEZ,I don't care.
116121,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164557,u4833,SCRATCH,Oh come Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
116122,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164556,u4828,JABEZ,Look here now--
116123,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164555,u4833,SCRATCH,Good evening Neighbor Stone.
116124,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164307,u4833,SCRATCH,1840. Well that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847.
116125,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164306,u4828,JABEZ,The seventh day of April --
116126,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164305,u4833,SCRATCH,Yes indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh I almost forgot -- what is the date?
116127,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164304,u4828,JABEZ,Well I'll be -- 
116128,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164303,u4833,SCRATCH,Excellent. A firm fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
116129,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164301,u4833,SCRATCH,A pin Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
116130,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164300,u4828,JABEZ,No no! Give it to me!
116131,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164299,u4833,SCRATCH,Well why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it smell it touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word Neighbor Stone if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--
116132,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164298,u4828,JABEZ,What does it mean here -- about my soul?
116133,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164297,u4833,SCRATCH,That's right Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
116134,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164296,u4828,JABEZ,It's mine?
116135,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164295,u4833,SCRATCH,Yes of course people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died you know how these things happen.
116136,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164294,u4828,JABEZ,Yes why shouldn't it?
116137,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164293,u4833,SCRATCH,Oh you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
116138,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164292,u4828,JABEZ,Where did it come from?
116139,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164279,u4833,SCRATCH,A clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere. Money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man. All he needs is a friend to point it out to him.  Like that!
116140,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164278,u4828,JABEZ,Well now Mister that sounds all right. But--
116141,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164277,u4833,SCRATCH,Of course. Why man you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
116142,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164276,u4828,JABEZ,Opportunities?
116143,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164275,u4833,SCRATCH,You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
116144,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164274,u4828,JABEZ,You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you I did.  I guess I did.
116145,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164273,u4833,SCRATCH,Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
116146,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L165029,u4839,WEBSTER,Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
116147,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L165028,u4828,JABEZ,Ma says breakfast's ready Mr. Webster!
116148,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L165022,u4839,WEBSTER,I know -- that was mighty queer Medford -- knew it the minute I tasted it. But it takes more than that to down Daniel Webster.
116149,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L165021,u4828,JABEZ,Well I --
116150,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L165020,u4839,WEBSTER,You were worried Jabez weren't you?
116151,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164937,u4839,WEBSTER,Oh come man come. Just because you've sold your soul to the devil that needn't make you a teetotaler.
116152,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164936,u4828,JABEZ,There's no joy in it for me.
116153,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164935,u4839,WEBSTER,There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
116154,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164933,u4839,WEBSTER,Then I'll just christen the jug with your permission Stone. Somehow or other waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
116155,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164932,u4828,JABEZ,Not long -- now.
116156,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164931,u4839,WEBSTER,They make plucky women in New England.  H'm ... how long have we to wait?
116157,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164924,u4828,JABEZ,Yes -- at midnight.
116158,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164923,u4839,WEBSTER,I see. And this is where he'd like to collect too.
116159,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164922,u4828,JABEZ,Yes Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
116160,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164921,u4839,WEBSTER,It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
116161,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164880,u4828,JABEZ,It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
116162,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164879,u4839,WEBSTER,No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother or your wife or your child.
116163,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164878,u4828,JABEZ,I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
116164,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164877,u4839,WEBSTER,I'm sorry you can't see that I know you could once -- you made a little speech once that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat with your gold pot! Mind you it's not the money I've been talking about it's what you make of it.
116165,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164876,u4839,WEBSTER,They'd have a good neighbor Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much much more!
116166,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164875,u4828,JABEZ,Contracts? -- Yes they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money they wouldn't have anything.
116167,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164874,u4839,WEBSTER,You Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts Mr. Stone?
116168,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164873,u4828,JABEZ,What -- what's on your mind?
116169,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164872,u4839,WEBSTER,That's just fine Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit I mean. You see the whole country sort of has its eye on me Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you Jabez. They watch us carefully our neighbors and our enemies and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart too. Do you know what I'm talking about Jabez?
116170,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164871,u4828,JABEZ,Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
116171,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164428,u4839,WEBSTER,Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
116172,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164427,u4828,JABEZ,Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife Mary.
116173,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164426,u4839,WEBSTER,Eloquent speech Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself --  -- under the circumstances.  Thank you.
116174,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164405,u4828,JABEZ,Thanks Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
116175,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164404,u4839,WEBSTER,Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe Jabez Stone!
116176,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164397,u4839,WEBSTER,Not at all lad -- not at all.  For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.
116177,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164396,u4828,JABEZ,Seems like it's my fault Mr. Webster.
116178,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164395,u4839,WEBSTER,I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
116179,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164394,u4828,JABEZ,Thank you Mr. Webster.
116180,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164393,u4839,WEBSTER,You win. Will you ride to the village with me Mr. Stone?
116181,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164392,u4839,WEBSTER,Ten throws it is.
116182,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164391,u4828,JABEZ,Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
116183,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164775,u4828,JABEZ,Shake!
116185,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164773,u4828,JABEZ,How much?
116187,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164771,u4828,JABEZ,Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
116189,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164769,u4828,JABEZ,That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house but don't mention Webster.
116191,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164767,u4828,JABEZ,Now Squire you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together don't we?
116194,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164763,u4828,JABEZ,You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
116195,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164762,u4828,JABEZ,You think that's a joke? I had him on there too but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
116197,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164760,u4828,JABEZ,Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
116199,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164758,u4828,JABEZ,Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
116201,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164756,u4828,JABEZ,Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
116203,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164754,u4828,JABEZ,Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
116205,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164749,u4828,JABEZ,You really think so?
116207,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164747,u4828,JABEZ,Howdy Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do Squire.
116209,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164487,u4828,JABEZ,But -- I was just lucky.
116210,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164484,u4828,JABEZ,Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
116212,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164477,u4828,JABEZ,Camomile tea!
116214,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164475,u4828,JABEZ,Headache -- Squire?
116217,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164472,u4828,JABEZ,Mighty good of you to come out Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
116218,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164469,u4828,JABEZ,Come right into the parlor won't you folks.
116221,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164464,u4828,JABEZ,Why -- good morning Squire.
116222,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164434,u4828,JABEZ,Shall we?
116224,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L165019,u4828,JABEZ,Mary!
116225,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L165018,u4831,MARY,Jabez -- Jabez!
116226,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164930,u4831,MARY,All right Jabez ...
116227,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164929,u4828,JABEZ,You must go now Mary -- you must!
116228,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164919,u4831,MARY,Oh Jabez! ...  Did you hear Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him won't you?
116229,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164918,u4828,JABEZ,Mary! Come back ...
116230,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164917,u4831,MARY,Jabez!
116231,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164916,u4828,JABEZ,Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
116232,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164821,u4828,JABEZ,What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
116233,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164820,u4831,MARY,It's -- different Jabez -- that's all.
116234,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164819,u4828,JABEZ,Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it Mary?
116235,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164817,u4831,MARY,I don't know Jabez.
116236,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164816,u4828,JABEZ,Why don't they come --
116237,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164705,u4828,JABEZ,Oh for heaven's sake leave me alone!
116238,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164704,u4831,MARY,Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
116239,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164703,u4828,JABEZ,It shows on your face.
116240,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164702,u4831,MARY,But Jabez I never said that!
116241,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164701,u4828,JABEZ,He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends or my new house -- or anything.
116242,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164700,u4831,MARY,My fault? ... Oh Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy if we show him how to be.
116243,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164699,u4828,JABEZ,Isn't that your own fault?
116244,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164698,u4831,MARY,Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
116245,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164693,u4828,JABEZ,You're not supposed to punish my son Mary.
116246,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164692,u4831,MARY,I am going to lock him up.
116247,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164691,u4828,JABEZ,What happened.... Where are you taking him?
116248,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164637,u4831,MARY,Nothing Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry sometimes.  Shh little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep --
116249,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164636,u4828,JABEZ,What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
116250,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164635,u4831,MARY,Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun Sleep sleep my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night Sleep baby sleep --
116251,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164602,u4831,MARY,Don't be cross with him Ma. This don't happen every day.
116252,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164601,u4828,JABEZ,Well -- I -- I-
116253,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164596,u4831,MARY,Hello Jabez --  Here's your son.
116254,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164595,u4828,JABEZ,Mary --
116255,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164571,u4828,JABEZ,Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
116256,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164570,u4831,MARY,Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
116257,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164518,u4828,JABEZ,I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now I've made up my mind.
116258,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164517,u4831,MARY,Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
116259,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164514,u4828,JABEZ,And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
116260,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164513,u4831,MARY,No no. I don't want to be idle.
116261,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164512,u4828,JABEZ,Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
116262,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164511,u4831,MARY,But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
116263,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164510,u4828,JABEZ,But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
116264,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164509,u4831,MARY,It's very becoming to you Mr. Selectman.
116265,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164508,u4828,JABEZ,I'm serious.
116266,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164507,u4831,MARY,Yes Mr. Selectman!
116267,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164506,u4828,JABEZ,That's one thing I want to talk to you about Mary.
116268,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164505,u4831,MARY,I'll never get my washing done.
116269,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164504,u4828,JABEZ,You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
116270,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164494,u4831,MARY,Oh -- Jabez.
116271,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164493,u4828,JABEZ,Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
116272,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164480,u4828,JABEZ,Thanks Mary.
116273,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164479,u4831,MARY,I'll get it Jabez.
116274,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164478,u4828,JABEZ,Mary get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
116275,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164462,u4831,MARY,Jabez --
116276,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164461,u4828,JABEZ,Mary --
116277,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164460,u4831,MARY,Don't take cold Jabez.  Come -- it's warm in here.
116278,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164459,u4828,JABEZ,Yes -- you are right Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
116279,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164458,u4831,MARY,There's hope and promise in it Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
116280,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164454,u4828,JABEZ,Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
116281,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164453,u4831,MARY,You'll never change -- will you?
116282,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164452,u4828,JABEZ,There is nothing to worry about now.
116283,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164451,u4831,MARY,Worried!
116284,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164450,u4828,JABEZ,Tired?
116285,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164449,u4831,MARY,But I'm glad to be home again --
116286,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164448,u4831,MARY,Oh Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
116287,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164170,u4828,JABEZ,It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers -- Oh glory -- where's my pants?
116288,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164169,u4831,MARY,Who is it?
116289,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164168,u4828,JABEZ,Well I'll be -- there's a rig turning in by the gate.
116290,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164158,u4828,JABEZ,Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading Ma. This man Job he had troubles didn't he?
116291,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164157,u4831,MARY,He's stubborn as a Stone.
116292,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164152,u4828,JABEZ,That's what we said.
116293,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164151,u4831,MARY,Jabez don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
116294,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164150,u4828,JABEZ,I remember Dad used to say sometimes when they were handing out hard luck the farmers got there first.
116295,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164149,u4828,JABEZ,Yep.
116296,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164148,u4831,MARY,Oh Jabez.
116297,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164147,u4828,JABEZ,I think his leg is broken.
116298,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164140,u4828,JABEZ,You're right Mary.
116299,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164139,u4831,MARY,Now Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion I don't know what is.
116300,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164138,u4828,JABEZ,What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
116301,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164134,u4828,JABEZ,All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
116302,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164133,u4831,MARY,He only wants you to throw the stick for him Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming too.
116303,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164132,u4828,JABEZ,Down Shep! Down!
116304,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164131,u4828,JABEZ,Coming.
116305,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164130,u4831,MARY,Jabez -- help!
116306,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L165025,u4829,MA STONE,Of course it's all right son. You had Daniel Webster didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster.
116307,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L165024,u4828,JABEZ,Ma -- Ma -- it's all right Ma!
116308,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164915,u4829,MA STONE,Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield son.... You told Mary to go--
116309,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164914,u4828,JABEZ,Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
116310,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164913,u4829,MA STONE,My son ... what's the matter?
116311,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164654,u4829,MA STONE,And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you young woman...!
116312,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164653,u4828,JABEZ,I want you to fix these fish!
116313,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164604,u4828,JABEZ,Sure Ma.
116314,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164603,u4829,MA STONE,You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.
116315,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164594,u4829,MA STONE,Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
116316,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164593,u4828,JABEZ,Golly Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
116317,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164592,u4829,MA STONE,You'll be a father any minute now.
116318,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164591,u4828,JABEZ,Ma -- is she? --
116319,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164569,u4828,JABEZ,Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time but I am! Oh bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
116320,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164568,u4829,MA STONE,Now that's the way to talk Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
116321,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164567,u4828,JABEZ,I say -- it don't matter.
116322,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164566,u4829,MA STONE,What's that you say Son?
116323,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164565,u4828,JABEZ,It don't matter!
116324,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164564,u4829,MA STONE,Oh here you are Jabez. Lan's I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
116325,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164553,u4829,MA STONE,A man can always change things Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters.
116326,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164552,u4828,JABEZ,Ma -- and yet a man could change that couldn't he?
116327,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164551,u4829,MA STONE,You see son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
116328,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164550,u4829,MA STONE,Wouldn't profit him none.
116329,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164549,u4828,JABEZ,I know Ma but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
116330,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164548,u4829,MA STONE,Why that's just sense Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
116331,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164547,u4828,JABEZ,Do you really think that?
116332,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164546,u4829,MA STONE,I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it Son.
116333,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164545,u4828,JABEZ,Money -- money's a funny thing ain't it Ma?
116334,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164544,u4828,JABEZ,Me -- a son.
116335,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164543,u4829,MA STONE,Lan's I'd think you was having the baby to hear you.
116336,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164542,u4828,JABEZ,I feel -- fidgety Ma -- not right at all.
116337,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164541,u4829,MA STONE,Well thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
116338,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164540,u4828,JABEZ,Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
116339,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164538,u4829,MA STONE,Oh go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance.
116340,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164537,u4828,JABEZ,My son! Do you really think Ma....
116341,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164536,u4829,MA STONE,It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down you make me nervous!  Lan's that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
116342,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164516,u4828,JABEZ,Now look here Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
116343,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164515,u4829,MA STONE,Well son I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
116344,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164324,u4828,JABEZ,Say Mary how is your shoulder?
116345,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164323,u4829,MA STONE,Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
116346,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164319,u4828,JABEZ,But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  Aren't you glad?
116347,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164318,u4829,MA STONE,Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right somehow!
116348,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164317,u4828,JABEZ,Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
116349,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164316,u4829,MA STONE,You found it in the barn hey?
116350,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164260,u4828,JABEZ,I can't help it. I mean it I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
116351,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164259,u4829,MA STONE,Hush up such talk Jabez!
116352,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164258,u4828,JABEZ,And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there just what I think.
116353,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164257,u4829,MA STONE,Well ... make him keep quiet.
116354,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164256,u4828,JABEZ,I dunno.
116355,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164255,u4829,MA STONE,What's ailing that dog?
116356,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164246,u4829,MA STONE,All right son -- if it helps.
116357,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164245,u4828,JABEZ,Helps sometimes to say it.
116358,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164244,u4829,MA STONE,That's a word you're too free with lately Jabez consarn this and consarn that ...
116359,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164243,u4828,JABEZ,Yes -- and you figgered right consarn it!
116360,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164242,u4829,MA STONE,I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
116361,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164241,u4828,JABEZ,How'd you know to have the calf ready Ma?
116362,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164164,u4829,MA STONE,Not on the Sabbath you won't Jabez!
116363,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164163,u4828,JABEZ,There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here by the fire Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
116364,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164162,u4828,JABEZ,That's right Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say didn't he Ma?
116365,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164161,u4829,MA STONE,Now Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
116366,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164160,u4828,JABEZ,Hard luck -- like me.
116367,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164159,u4829,MA STONE,You know that son.
116368,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164156,u4828,JABEZ,Sorry Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
116369,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164155,u4829,MA STONE,Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
116370,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164154,u4828,JABEZ,Consarn the consarn --
116371,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164674,u4828,JABEZ,Belle give the Sheriff a cup of rum.
116373,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164672,u4828,JABEZ,Come in Sheriff.
116374,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164490,u4828,JABEZ,Very well folks. I accept.
116376,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164330,u4828,JABEZ,And you didn't get it hey? Come on we'll have another talk with him.
116378,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164328,u4828,JABEZ,Hello Sheriff.
116380,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164220,u4828,JABEZ,Let him try it.
116382,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164218,u4828,JABEZ,It's all right Sheriff.
116384,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164815,u4831,MARY,I won't forget.
116385,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164814,u4829,MA STONE,Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
116386,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164813,u4829,MA STONE,Ah fiddlesticks -- you are old enough to know what you are doing.
116387,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164812,u4831,MARY,You aren't angry with me?
116388,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164811,u4829,MA STONE,So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
116389,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164716,u4831,MARY,I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
116390,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164715,u4829,MA STONE,What's that?
116391,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164714,u4831,MARY,Worried about me! Well you just stop it!
116392,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164713,u4829,MA STONE,Me? Why look here Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you that's all.
116393,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164712,u4831,MARY,Now Ma -- You just try to set an example for me and keep hold of yourself.
116394,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164711,u4829,MA STONE,Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
116395,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164652,u4831,MARY,Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
116396,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164651,u4829,MA STONE,She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me right away!
116397,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164649,u4831,MARY,Yes Ma -- I'm ready --
116398,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164648,u4829,MA STONE,Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
116399,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164629,u4831,MARY,What mountain?
116400,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164628,u4829,MA STONE,The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
116401,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164627,u4831,MARY,What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
116402,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164503,u4829,MA STONE,Yes Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well who would have thought of that?
116403,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164502,u4831,MARY,You know Ma why the Squire came to see Jabez?
116404,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164321,u4829,MA STONE,H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.
116405,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164320,u4831,MARY,I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.
116406,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164265,u4831,MARY,Yes Jabez -- don't worry.
116407,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164264,u4829,MA STONE,Let her be son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
116408,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164167,u4829,MA STONE,Land sakes I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes Mary you go ahead and read.
116409,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164166,u4831,MARY,That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson Ma.
116410,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164145,u4831,MARY,I guess we won't.
116411,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164144,u4829,MA STONE,Well I guess we won't be going to church today.
116412,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164137,u4831,MARY,Coming Ma.
116413,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164136,u4829,MA STONE,Mary -- Jabez --
116414,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164135,u4831,MARY,You throw mighty far Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
116416,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164410,u4839,WEBSTER,Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand Martin?
116418,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164408,u4839,WEBSTER,Well Martin I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there I'll show them to you.
116420,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164406,u4839,WEBSTER,What are you looking for Colonel?  What's your name?
116421,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L165034,u4831,MARY,She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
116422,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L165033,u4839,WEBSTER,There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
116423,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164928,u4839,WEBSTER,I'll do my best Mary.
116424,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164927,u4831,MARY,Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
116425,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164926,u4839,WEBSTER,Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband you've done. And frankly in a very few moments this is going to be no place for a lady.
116426,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164925,u4831,MARY,Jabez ...
116427,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164870,u4839,WEBSTER,Are you Mary?  Well I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests anyhow.
116428,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164869,u4831,MARY,Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
116429,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164741,u4839,WEBSTER,And now come on Mary. I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States raised right here in Marshfield -- of course!
116430,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164740,u4831,MARY,Oh could you Mr. Webster ?
116431,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164739,u4839,WEBSTER,Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
116432,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164738,u4831,MARY,You see I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
116433,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164737,u4839,WEBSTER,You don't have to defend him to me Mary -- I've been called names myself.
116434,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164736,u4831,MARY,Mr. Webster you mustn't believe all that people say.
116435,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164735,u4839,WEBSTER,I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
116436,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164734,u4831,MARY,Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
116437,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164733,u4839,WEBSTER,Yes you've chatted a lot woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But Mary forgive an old lawyer's legal mind I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point isn't there?
116438,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164732,u4831,MARY,Goodness Mr. Webster I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
116439,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164731,u4839,WEBSTER,No you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
116440,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164730,u4831,MARY,Of course not --
116441,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164729,u4839,WEBSTER,Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
116442,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164728,u4831,MARY,No really thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
116443,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164727,u4839,WEBSTER,Well Mary it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
116444,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164431,u4831,MARY,-- I'm going to try Mr. Webster.
116445,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164430,u4839,WEBSTER,You've got a smart man Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
116446,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164429,u4831,MARY,It is.
116447,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164726,u4839,WEBSTER,Why that's different!  Well boys I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
116449,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164724,u4839,WEBSTER,If it's the British Minister take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
116451,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164722,u4839,WEBSTER,Hullooo!
116453,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L165016,u4839,WEBSTER,Why you long-barreled slab-sided lantern- jawed note-shaving crook be off with you ...
116454,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L165015,u4833,SCRATCH,My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
116455,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164985,u4839,WEBSTER,I object.
116456,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164984,u4833,SCRATCH,Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference barter and sale of a certain piece of property to wit his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
116457,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164973,u4839,WEBSTER,I'll drink to that Mr. Scratch!
116458,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164972,u4833,SCRATCH,The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win Mr. Webster!
116459,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164971,u4839,WEBSTER,Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
116460,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164970,u4833,SCRATCH,Very well. -- You shall have your trial Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
116461,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164969,u4839,WEBSTER,I do! If I can't win this case with a jury you shall have me too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
116462,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164968,u4833,SCRATCH,You mean -- a jury trial?
116463,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164967,u4839,WEBSTER,Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
116464,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164966,u4833,SCRATCH,And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of still in every church in New England? 'Tis true the North claims me for a Southerner and the South for a Northerner but I am neither. To tell the truth Mr. Webster though I don't like to boast of it my name is older in the country than yours.
116465,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164965,u4839,WEBSTER,Well I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
116466,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164964,u4833,SCRATCH,Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
116467,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164963,u4839,WEBSTER,H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
116468,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164962,u4833,SCRATCH,There Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
116469,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164961,u4839,WEBSTER,Not so fast Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
116470,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164960,u4833,SCRATCH,Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
116471,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164948,u4839,WEBSTER,Cup for cup!
116472,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164947,u4833,SCRATCH,Talk has never proved that question Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
116473,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164946,u4839,WEBSTER,There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
116474,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164945,u4833,SCRATCH,Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or more plainly a deep and enveloping sleep.
116475,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164944,u4839,WEBSTER,Me?
116476,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164943,u4833,SCRATCH,It even kicked back -- once at you didn't it?
116477,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164942,u4839,WEBSTER,Why certainly -- but be careful Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back even with old-timers like yourself. 
116478,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164941,u4833,SCRATCH,Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?
116479,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164940,u4839,WEBSTER,Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
116480,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164939,u4833,SCRATCH,Mr. Webster I presume?
116481,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164390,u4833,SCRATCH,Pretty good -- that's perfect!
116482,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164389,u4839,WEBSTER,Say that's pretty good young man.
116483,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164388,u4833,SCRATCH,I'll be there too!
116484,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164387,u4839,WEBSTER,I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
116485,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164386,u4833,SCRATCH,With the presidential election coming up I thought I could be of some help sir.
116486,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164385,u4839,WEBSTER,Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
116487,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164384,u4833,SCRATCH,It's only a short drive Mr. Webster.
116488,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164353,u4833,SCRATCH,Oh that's what you want -- well you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
116490,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164351,u4833,SCRATCH,Why don't you?
116492,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164349,u4833,SCRATCH,You can talk to me ...
116494,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164347,u4833,SCRATCH,The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
116496,m322,the devil and daniel webster,L164345,u4833,SCRATCH,My money? Why Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
120414,m334,the english patient,L184716,u5054,KATHARINE,Our Garden our garden - not so much the garden but the copse alongside it wild a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France.  The Devil's Chimney it was called -  The Devil's Chimney I don't know why.  Darling.  My darling.
120415,m334,the english patient,L184715,u5046,ALMÁSY,Tell me about your garden.
120416,m334,the english patient,L184714,u5046,ALMÁSY,Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again.
120417,m334,the english patient,L184713,u5054,KATHARINE,I know.
120418,m334,the english patient,L184712,u5046,ALMÁSY,I'm sorry Katharine.
120419,m334,the english patient,L184711,u5054,KATHARINE,Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
120420,m334,the english patient,L184710,u5046,ALMÁSY,And a good read.  Don't waste it.
120421,m334,the english patient,L184709,u5046,ALMÁSY,I promise I'll come back.  I promise I'll never leave you.  And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party.
120422,m334,the english patient,L184708,u5054,KATHARINE,Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind with particular hymns.  Very English.  And I know exactly where I want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where I grew up. With a view of the sea.  So promise me you'll come back for you.
120423,m334,the english patient,L184707,u5046,ALMÁSY,Listen to me Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken too - and some ribs which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine and I'll never leave you.
120424,m334,the english patient,L184706,u5054,KATHARINE,Oh dear.
120425,m334,the english patient,L184705,u5046,ALMÁSY,Yes.  Absolutely.
120426,m334,the english patient,L184704,u5054,KATHARINE,Shall we be all right?
120427,m334,the english patient,L184703,u5046,ALMÁSY,I'm just going to find things for the fire.
120428,m334,the english patient,L184702,u5054,KATHARINE,Don't leave me!
120429,m334,the english patient,L184701,u5046,ALMÁSY,I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
120430,m334,the english patient,L184700,u5054,KATHARINE,It's so cold.
120431,m334,the english patient,L184699,u5054,KATHARINE,Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
120432,m334,the english patient,L184698,u5046,ALMÁSY,You're wearing the thimble.
120433,m334,the english patient,L184697,u5054,KATHARINE,You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
120434,m334,the english patient,L184696,u5046,ALMÁSY,Don't talk.
120435,m334,the english patient,L184695,u5054,KATHARINE,Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
120436,m334,the english patient,L184694,u5046,ALMÁSY,What?
120437,m334,the english patient,L184693,u5054,KATHARINE,Why did you hate me?
120438,m334,the english patient,L184692,u5046,ALMÁSY,I know darling I'm sorry.
120439,m334,the english patient,L184691,u5054,KATHARINE,It hurts too much.
120440,m334,the english patient,L184690,u5046,ALMÁSY,We've got to get you out of here.
120441,m334,the english patient,L184689,u5054,KATHARINE,Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
120442,m334,the english patient,L184687,u5054,KATHARINE,A surprise he said.
120443,m334,the english patient,L184686,u5046,ALMÁSY,Why did he bring you?
120444,m334,the english patient,L184685,u5054,KATHARINE,I can't move.  I can't get out.
120445,m334,the english patient,L184684,u5046,ALMÁSY,Katharine!  Oh dear God Katharine - what are you doing here?
120446,m334,the english patient,L184592,u5054,KATHARINE,Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
120447,m334,the english patient,L184591,u5046,ALMÁSY,Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
120448,m334,the english patient,L184590,u5054,KATHARINE,No.
120449,m334,the english patient,L184589,u5046,ALMÁSY,Dance with me.
120450,m334,the english patient,L184588,u5054,KATHARINE,You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
120451,m334,the english patient,L184587,u5046,ALMÁSY,I've watched you - on verandahs at Garden Parties at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
120452,m334,the english patient,L184586,u5054,KATHARINE,Don't do this.
120453,m334,the english patient,L184585,u5046,ALMÁSY,Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
120454,m334,the english patient,L184584,u5054,KATHARINE,Would you let me pass?
120455,m334,the english patient,L184583,u5046,ALMÁSY,What?  What?  That boy that little boy you were holding his collar gripping his collar what for?
120456,m334,the english patient,L184582,u5054,KATHARINE,What?
120457,m334,the english patient,L184581,u5046,ALMÁSY,Why did you hold his collar?
120458,m334,the english patient,L184487,u5054,KATHARINE,You will.  You will.
120459,m334,the english patient,L184486,u5046,ALMÁSY,I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods can't find this funny.
120460,m334,the english patient,L184484,u5046,ALMÁSY,Don't go over it again please.
120461,m334,the english patient,L184483,u5054,KATHARINE,I just know - any minute he'll find out we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
120462,m334,the english patient,L184482,u5046,ALMÁSY,I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing because I'm not.
120463,m334,the english patient,L184481,u5054,KATHARINE,I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
120464,m334,the english patient,L184406,u5046,ALMÁSY,Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.
120465,m334,the english patient,L184405,u5054,KATHARINE,Shall we be all right?
120466,m334,the english patient,L184404,u5046,ALMÁSY,Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
120467,m334,the english patient,L184403,u5054,KATHARINE,That day had you followed me to the market?
120468,m334,the english patient,L184402,u5046,ALMÁSY,I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
120469,m334,the english patient,L184398,u5046,ALMÁSY,Yes.  A different wife.
120470,m334,the english patient,L184397,u5054,KATHARINE,This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
120471,m334,the english patient,L184396,u5046,ALMÁSY,Madox knows I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
120472,m334,the english patient,L184395,u5054,KATHARINE,I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
120473,m334,the english patient,L184394,u5046,ALMÁSY,This - what's it called? - this place I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
120474,m334,the english patient,L184392,u5054,KATHARINE,You bastard I was believing you!
120475,m334,the english patient,L184391,u5046,ALMÁSY,Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
120476,m334,the english patient,L184390,u5046,ALMÁSY,It's a long song - Szerelem means loveand the story - there's a Hungarian Count he's a wanderer a fool.  For years he's on some kind of quest who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  He sews her clothes he worships the hem of -
120477,m334,the english patient,L184389,u5054,KATHARINE,It's beautiful.  What's it about?
120478,m334,the english patient,L184388,u5046,ALMÁSY,No no it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
120479,m334,the english patient,L184387,u5054,KATHARINE,Arabic?
120480,m334,the english patient,L184386,u5046,ALMÁSY,It's a folk song.
120481,m334,the english patient,L184385,u5054,KATHARINE,This is - what is this?
120482,m334,the english patient,L184320,u5046,ALMÁSY,I'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth.  Swoon.  I'll catch you.
120483,m334,the english patient,L184319,u5054,KATHARINE,This is empty just coming!
120484,m334,the english patient,L184318,u5046,ALMÁSY,I can still taste you.
120485,m334,the english patient,L184315,u5046,ALMÁSY,I can't work.  I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
120486,m334,the english patient,L184314,u5054,KATHARINE,No.
120487,m334,the english patient,L184313,u5046,ALMÁSY,Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
120488,m334,the english patient,L184312,u5054,KATHARINE,What?  No!
120489,m334,the english patient,L184311,u5046,ALMÁSY,Say you're sick.
120490,m334,the english patient,L184271,u5046,ALMÁSY,Ownership.  Being owned.  When you leave you should forget me.
120491,m334,the english patient,L184270,u5054,KATHARINE,A lie.  What do you hate most?
120492,m334,the english patient,L184269,u5046,ALMÁSY,What do you hate most?
120493,m334,the english patient,L184268,u5054,KATHARINE,Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almásy nods.
120494,m334,the english patient,L184267,u5046,ALMÁSY,What else?
120495,m334,the english patient,L184266,u5054,KATHARINE,What do I love?  I love rice pudding and water the fish in it hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
120496,m334,the english patient,L184265,u5046,ALMÁSY,Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
120497,m334,the english patient,L184264,u5054,KATHARINE,Now.
120498,m334,the english patient,L184263,u5046,ALMÁSY,When were you least happy?
120499,m334,the english patient,L184262,u5054,KATHARINE,Now.
120500,m334,the english patient,L184261,u5046,ALMÁSY,When were you most happy?
120501,m334,the english patient,L184260,u5046,ALMÁSY,That makes it harder still.
120502,m334,the english patient,L184259,u5054,KATHARINE,A woman should never learn to sew and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
120503,m334,the english patient,L184258,u5046,ALMÁSY,You don't sew at all!
120504,m334,the english patient,L184257,u5054,KATHARINE,You sew very badly.
120505,m334,the english patient,L184256,u5046,ALMÁSY,Good.
120506,m334,the english patient,L184255,u5054,KATHARINE,I'm impressed you can sew.
120507,m334,the english patient,L184253,u5046,ALMÁSY,I believe you still have my book.
120508,m334,the english patient,L184252,u5054,KATHARINE,Don't.
120509,m334,the english patient,L184251,u5046,ALMÁSY,Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns disgusted.
120510,m334,the english patient,L184250,u5054,KATHARINE,Will you please come in?
120511,m334,the english patient,L184249,u5046,ALMÁSY,No.
120512,m334,the english patient,L184248,u5054,KATHARINE,Will you not come in?
120513,m334,the english patient,L184242,u5046,ALMÁSY,No but I think I do.
120514,m334,the english patient,L184241,u5054,KATHARINE,Do they know them?
120515,m334,the english patient,L184239,u5054,KATHARINE,No the marriage isn't a fiction.
120516,m334,the english patient,L184238,u5046,ALMÁSY,And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
120517,m334,the english patient,L184237,u5054,KATHARINE,Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
120518,m334,the english patient,L184235,u5054,KATHARINE,Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
120519,m334,the english patient,L184234,u5046,ALMÁSY,Water?  Yes we have water we have a little in our can we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly extremely practical.  Come on come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
120520,m334,the english patient,L184233,u5054,KATHARINE,Of course.  Is it am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
120521,m334,the english patient,L184232,u5046,ALMÁSY,Could I ask you please to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
120522,m334,the english patient,L184231,u5054,KATHARINE,Oh my God the others!
120523,m334,the english patient,L184230,u5046,ALMÁSY,Madox will have calculated how many miles they'll soon turn around.
120524,m334,the english patient,L184228,u5046,ALMÁSY,All true.  Herodotus your friend tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress their swords raised.
120525,m334,the english patient,L184227,u5054,KATHARINE,Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
120526,m334,the english patient,L184226,u5046,ALMÁSY,- there is the Harmattan a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
120527,m334,the english patient,L184224,u5054,KATHARINE,Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
120528,m334,the english patient,L184223,u5046,ALMÁSY,Yes.  Absolutely.
120529,m334,the english patient,L184222,u5054,KATHARINE,Shall we be all right?
120530,m334,the english patient,L184221,u5046,ALMÁSY,No.
120531,m334,the english patient,L184220,u5054,KATHARINE,This is not very good is it?
120532,m334,the english patient,L184219,u5046,ALMÁSY,In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
120533,m334,the english patient,L184218,u5054,KATHARINE,They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
120534,m334,the english patient,L184217,u5046,ALMÁSY,See what's happening to them - the stars.
120535,m334,the english patient,L184216,u5054,KATHARINE,What am I looking at?
120536,m334,the english patient,L184215,u5046,ALMÁSY,Look over there.
120537,m334,the english patient,L184214,u5054,KATHARINE,I'm quite all right thank you.
120538,m334,the english patient,L184213,u5046,ALMÁSY,You should come into the shelter.
120539,m334,the english patient,L184212,u5054,KATHARINE,And that would be unconscionable I suppose to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
120540,m334,the english patient,L184211,u5046,ALMÁSY,There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
120541,m334,the english patient,L184210,u5054,KATHARINE,I'd like you to have them.
120542,m334,the english patient,L184209,u5046,ALMÁSY,We took several photographs there's no need.
120543,m334,the english patient,L184208,u5054,KATHARINE,I thought you might paste them into your book.
120544,m334,the english patient,L184207,u5046,ALMÁSY,What's this?
120545,m334,the english patient,L184190,u5054,KATHARINE,Ask Al Auf. Almásy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
120546,m334,the english patient,L184189,u5046,ALMÁSY,I do not.
120547,m334,the english patient,L184188,u5054,KATHARINE,You sing.  All the time.
120548,m334,the english patient,L184187,u5046,ALMÁSY,Pardon?
120549,m334,the english patient,L184186,u5054,KATHARINE,Actually you sing.
120550,m334,the english patient,L184157,u5046,ALMÁSY,Her or me?
120551,m334,the english patient,L184156,u5054,KATHARINE,Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
120552,m334,the english patient,L184155,u5046,ALMÁSY,He said - be careful.
120553,m334,the english patient,L184154,u5054,KATHARINE,What is he saying?  Come on what did he say?
120554,m334,the english patient,L184152,u5046,ALMÁSY,The Ostrich is a detour.  A poor man hunts an ostrich it's the method.  Nothing to do with Zerzura.  To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move.  The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds a wadi and stands where the ostrich can see him on the horizon and doesn't move doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run.  At nightfall he moves fifty sixty yards.  When the ostrich comes the next day the man is there but he's nearer.  Haunting the ostrich.
120555,m334,the english patient,L184151,u5054,KATHARINE,Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
120556,m334,the english patient,L184150,u5046,ALMÁSY,A mountain curved like a woman's back a plateau the shape of an ear.
120557,m334,the english patient,L184149,u5054,KATHARINE,What do you mean poetry?
120558,m334,the english patient,L184148,u5046,ALMÁSY,This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich he's been telling me about Zerzura he thinks he's been there but his map the route he's describing he couldn't survive the journey now but he's a poet so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
120559,m334,the english patient,L184081,u5054,KATHARINE,So why follow me?  Escort me by all means.  Following me is predatory isn't it?
120560,m334,the english patient,L184080,u5046,ALMÁSY,As the wife of one of our party.
120561,m334,the english patient,L184079,u5054,KATHARINE,You felt obliged to.
120562,m334,the english patient,L184078,u5046,ALMÁSY,I was concerned.  As I said women in that part of Cairo a European women I felt obliged to.
120563,m334,the english patient,L184077,u5054,KATHARINE,After the market you followed me to the hotel.
120564,m334,the english patient,L184076,u5046,ALMÁSY,Excuse me?
120565,m334,the english patient,L184075,u5054,KATHARINE,Why did you follow me yesterday?
120566,m334,the english patient,L184056,u5054,KATHARINE,Excuse me.
120567,m334,the english patient,L184055,u5046,ALMÁSY,I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
120568,m334,the english patient,L184054,u5054,KATHARINE,I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me somehow. You're a foreigner too aren't you here in this market?
120569,m334,the english patient,L184053,u5046,ALMÁSY,That insults them.
120570,m334,the english patient,L184052,u5054,KATHARINE,I don't care to bargain.
120571,m334,the english patient,L184051,u5046,ALMÁSY,This is not worth eight pounds Mrs. Clifton.
120572,m334,the english patient,L184050,u5054,KATHARINE,I don't want to go back.
120573,m334,the english patient,L184049,u5046,ALMÁSY,You've been cheated don't worry we'll take it back.
120574,m334,the english patient,L184048,u5054,KATHARINE,Excuse me?
120575,m334,the english patient,L184047,u5046,ALMÁSY,Which stall?
120576,m334,the english patient,L184046,u5054,KATHARINE,Seven pounds eight I suppose. Why?
120577,m334,the english patient,L184045,u5046,ALMÁSY,They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
120578,m334,the english patient,L184044,u5054,KATHARINE,Hello!  Good morning.
120579,m334,the english patient,L184043,u5046,ALMÁSY,How much did you pay?
120580,m334,the english patient,L183961,u5054,KATHARINE,Yes thank you Gyges son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?
120581,m334,the english patient,L183960,u5046,ALMÁSY,Daskylus
120582,m334,the english patient,L183957,u5046,ALMÁSY,I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
120583,m334,the english patient,L183956,u5054,KATHARINE,I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it
120584,m334,the english patient,L183950,u5046,ALMÁSY,What kind of fossils?
120585,m334,the english patient,L183949,u5054,KATHARINE,Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
120586,m334,the english patient,L183918,u5046,ALMÁSY,A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.  Big car slow car chauffeur-driven car still a car.
120587,m334,the english patient,L183917,u5054,KATHARINE,I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
120588,m334,the english patient,L183916,u5046,ALMÁSY,Thank you.
120589,m334,the english patient,L184575,u5046,ALMÁSY,And the people here don't want us. Are you kidding?  The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials  - isn't that right? Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood.  Isn't that right?
120591,m334,the english patient,L184573,u5046,ALMÁSY,Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Führer!  Il Duce.
120592,m334,the english patient,L184332,u5046,ALMÁSY,I haven't no.  Sorry.
120594,m334,the english patient,L184330,u5046,ALMÁSY,What?
120597,m334,the english patient,L184181,u5046,ALMÁSY,Very well.
120599,m334,the english patient,L184179,u5046,ALMÁSY,All the same I were I you I would be concerned -
120601,m334,the english patient,L184177,u5046,ALMÁSY,I think the desert is it's - for a woman - it's very tough I wonder if it's not too much for her.
120603,m334,the english patient,L184175,u5046,ALMÁSY,Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
120605,m334,the english patient,L184173,u5046,ALMÁSY,Safe journey.
120607,m334,the english patient,L184167,u5046,ALMÁSY,What kind of photographs?
120608,m334,the english patient,L183924,u5046,ALMÁSY,There you have me.
120610,m334,the english patient,L183920,u5046,ALMÁSY,Still a car.
120612,m334,the english patient,L184734,u5046,ALMÁSY,No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody just give me the fucking jeep!
120614,m334,the english patient,L184732,u5046,ALMÁSY,Look listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name I want you to give me this jeep!
120616,m334,the english patient,L184730,u5046,ALMÁSY,Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
120618,m334,the english patient,L184728,u5046,ALMÁSY,Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me I'm I've been walking I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
120620,m334,the english patient,L184726,u5046,ALMÁSY,What?
120622,m334,the english patient,L184724,u5046,ALMÁSY,No I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too to come with me can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay of course - and some morphine and  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
120624,m334,the english patient,L184722,u5046,ALMÁSY,I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
120626,m334,the english patient,L184720,u5046,ALMÁSY,Could I trouble you for some water?
120628,m334,the english patient,L184663,u5046,ALMÁSY,There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
120630,m334,the english patient,L184661,u5046,ALMÁSY,Goodbye my friend. They shake hands.
120633,m334,the english patient,L184658,u5046,ALMÁSY,Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
120635,m334,the english patient,L184656,u5046,ALMÁSY,Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
120637,m334,the english patient,L184654,u5046,ALMÁSY,I told you so.
120639,m334,the english patient,L184652,u5046,ALMÁSY,Right.
120641,m334,the english patient,L184580,u5046,ALMÁSY,Absolutely right shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
120644,m334,the english patient,L184569,u5046,ALMÁSY,I believe I'm rather late.
120645,m334,the english patient,L184471,u5046,ALMÁSY,Own the desert.
120647,m334,the english patient,L184469,u5046,ALMÁSY,Why do they care about our maps?
120649,m334,the english patient,L184467,u5046,ALMÁSY,What's the matter with you?
120651,m334,the english patient,L184465,u5046,ALMÁSY,In my room.
120653,m334,the english patient,L184462,u5046,ALMÁSY,Which we couldn't explore because of rocks because of cross-winds it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
120655,m334,the english patient,L184460,u5046,ALMÁSY,No because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility
120658,m334,the english patient,L184200,u5046,ALMÁSY,Try to get a second radiator we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
120660,m334,the english patient,L183982,u5046,ALMÁSY,Cut the ropes.  I left a note on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller the engine cranks up.
120662,m334,the english patient,L183980,u5046,ALMÁSY,I looked at them.  They're shrubs small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
120664,m334,the english patient,L183978,u5046,ALMÁSY,Her hands and feet were tied.
120666,m334,the english patient,L183976,u5046,ALMÁSY,Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
120669,m334,the english patient,L184739,u5046,ALMÁSY,Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
120671,m334,the english patient,L184737,u5046,ALMÁSY,Please - I beg you I beg you I beg you please listen to me this is a terrible mistake. Just stop please and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
120673,m334,the english patient,L184735,u5046,ALMÁSY,Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
120675,m334,the english patient,L184005,u5051,HANA,Would it? She kisses him very softly on the lips.
120677,m334,the english patient,L184003,u5051,HANA,No I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
120679,m334,the english patient,L183999,u5051,HANA,Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
120681,m334,the english patient,L183997,u5051,HANA,How are you?
120682,m334,the english patient,L184563,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
120684,m334,the english patient,L184555,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,Don't cut me.  Come on.
120686,m334,the english patient,L184553,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,Don't cut me.
120688,m334,the english patient,L184550,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you you only see trouble.

120714,m334,the english patient,L184305,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.

120731,m334,the english patient,L184134,u5051,HANA,Where've you been?

120734,m334,the english patient,L184034,u5051,HANA,Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me but I don't need company I don't need to be looked at.
120735,m334,the english patient,L184033,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,I'm okay.  Look it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.

120737,m334,the english patient,L184031,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,No.
120738,m334,the english patient,L184030,u5051,HANA,So you can shoot a pistol?
120739,m334,the english patient,L184029,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean you know blah-blah if it's convenient if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons you know - while we hug.  I was a thief so they think I'd be good at that.
120740,m334,the english patient,L184028,u5051,HANA,So was my Patient.
120741,m334,the english patient,L184027,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,Yeah for a while.

120745,m334,the english patient,L184022,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot north of Laurier.  Bonjour.

120750,m334,the english patient,L184760,u5062,THE PATIENT,You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
120751,m334,the english patient,L184759,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,You get to the morning and the poison leaks away doesn't it? Black nights fucking black nights when you want to howl like a dog.

120752,m334,the english patient,L184758,u5062,THE PATIENT,Yes I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't I couldn't even do that properly.
120753,m334,the english patient,L184757,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
120754,m334,the english patient,L184683,u5062,THE PATIENT,Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.
120755,m334,the english patient,L184682,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,But you were among the British they were your friends - why betray them?
120756,m334,the english patient,L184681,u5062,THE PATIENT,Thousands of people did die just different people.
120757,m334,the english patient,L184680,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
120758,m334,the english patient,L184679,u5062,THE PATIENT,The rest meant nothing to me.
120759,m334,the english patient,L184678,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,What did you say?
120760,m334,the english patient,L184677,u5062,THE PATIENT,I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
120761,m334,the english patient,L184676,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,You were the only man who knew the desert well enough the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
120762,m334,the english patient,L184675,u5062,THE PATIENT,And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
120763,m334,the english patient,L184674,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,Before you went over to the Germans before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk so they made an impression.
120764,m334,the english patient,L184673,u5062,THE PATIENT,I see.
120765,m334,the english patient,L184672,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.

120768,m334,the english patient,L184669,u5062,THE PATIENT,We shall miss you.
120769,m334,the english patient,L184668,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,There are going to be trials they want me to interpret don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
120770,m334,the english patient,L184667,u5062,THE PATIENT,Hana tells me you're leaving.
120771,m334,the english patient,L184634,u5062,THE PATIENT,What?

120773,m334,the english patient,L184629,u5062,THE PATIENT,Very true!
120774,m334,the english patient,L184628,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,Well anything you do is likely to be fatal so you know -

120783,m334,the english patient,L184353,u5062,THE PATIENT,I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
120784,m334,the english patient,L184352,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
120785,m334,the english patient,L184351,u5062,THE PATIENT,Moose.
120786,m334,the english patient,L184350,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,Is it you?  If I said Moose I look different fuck why shouldn't you?
120787,m334,the english patient,L184349,u5062,THE PATIENT,I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
120788,m334,the english patient,L184348,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
120789,m334,the english patient,L184347,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
120790,m334,the english patient,L184346,u5062,THE PATIENT,Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
120791,m334,the english patient,L184098,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
120792,m334,the english patient,L184097,u5062,THE PATIENT,I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
120793,m334,the english patient,L184096,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,And you've forgotten yours.
120794,m334,the english patient,L184095,u5062,THE PATIENT,Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
120795,m334,the english patient,L184094,u5048,CARAVAGGIO,Are you planning to be the exception?
120796,m334,the english patient,L184093,u5062,THE PATIENT,I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
120797,m334,the english patient,L184090,u5062,THE PATIENT,All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.

120808,m334,the english patient,L184340,u5054,KATHARINE,Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green anything green or rain wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.

120826,m334,the english patient,L183968,u5054,KATHARINE,But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story she said this -
120842,m334,the english patient,L184632,u5062,THE PATIENT,That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club.

120876,m334,the english patient,L184146,u5062,THE PATIENT,Do I recognize him?  I recognize what he is. I like him.  He's Canadian.  He can read Italian.  He can catch rabbits.
120877,m334,the english patient,L184145,u5051,HANA,He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
120878,m334,the english patient,L184144,u5062,THE PATIENT,That's a different dress.
120879,m334,the english patient,L184143,u5051,HANA,He came back he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
120880,m334,the english patient,L184142,u5062,THE PATIENT,Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
120881,m334,the english patient,L184124,u5062,THE PATIENT,Please don't waste your time on pleasantries -
120882,m334,the english patient,L184123,u5051,HANA,This is Captain McGann.
120883,m334,the english patient,L184122,u5051,HANA,Thank you.  Thank you.
120884,m334,the english patient,L184121,u5062,THE PATIENT,Well then - yes.  Of course.
120885,m334,the english patient,L184120,u5051,HANA,No I can't go but if it if you weren't offended it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
120886,m334,the english patient,L184119,u5062,THE PATIENT,Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
120887,m334,the english patient,L184118,u5051,HANA,He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
120888,m334,the english patient,L184117,u5062,THE PATIENT,Your friend?
120889,m334,the english patient,L184116,u5051,HANA,Can I ask - my friend can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
120890,m334,the english patient,L184115,u5062,THE PATIENT,Yes?
120891,m334,the english patient,L184114,u5051,HANA,Excuse me -
120892,m334,the english patient,L184042,u5051,HANA,He won't disturb us then.  I think he's after morphine.  There's a war.  Where you come from becomes important.  And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.
120893,m334,the english patient,L184041,u5062,THE PATIENT,Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
120894,m334,the english patient,L184040,u5051,HANA,He needn't disturb you.
120895,m334,the english patient,L184039,u5062,THE PATIENT,Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
120896,m334,the english patient,L184038,u5051,HANA,He's Canadian.
120897,m334,the english patient,L184037,u5062,THE PATIENT,Why?  Can he lay eggs?
120898,m334,the english patient,L184036,u5051,HANA,There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
120899,m334,the english patient,L183995,u5051,HANA,Because I'm a nurse.
120900,m334,the english patient,L183994,u5062,THE PATIENT,Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
120901,m334,the english patient,L183993,u5051,HANA,Are you crazy?
120902,m334,the english patient,L183992,u5062,THE PATIENT,Could I have a cigarette?
120903,m334,the english patient,L183991,u5051,HANA,Are you remembering more?
120904,m334,the english patient,L183990,u5062,THE PATIENT,I can see my wife in that view.
120905,m334,the english patient,L183989,u5051,HANA,No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
120906,m334,the english patient,L183988,u5062,THE PATIENT,Zerzura the White City of Acacias the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
120907,m334,the english patient,L183987,u5051,HANA,I'm turning you.
120908,m334,the english patient,L183986,u5062,THE PATIENT,Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
120909,m334,the english patient,L183985,u5051,HANA,How?  How can you see anything?
120910,m334,the english patient,L183984,u5062,THE PATIENT,I can already see.
120911,m334,the english patient,L183983,u5051,HANA,I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good it's a view from a monastery.
120912,m334,the english patient,L183974,u5062,THE PATIENT,Yes.  Dropping off.
120913,m334,the english patient,L183973,u5051,HANA,Are you asleep?
120914,m334,the english patient,L183966,u5051,HANA,When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure
120915,m334,the english patient,L183965,u5062,THE PATIENT,I'm not laughing at you.  Go on please.
120916,m334,the english patient,L183964,u5051,HANA,Candaulesyou're laughing at me.
120917,m334,the english patient,L183963,u5062,THE PATIENT,Candaules
120918,m334,the english patient,L183962,u5051,HANA,I will hide you in the room where we sleep said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
120919,m334,the english patient,L183931,u5062,THE PATIENT,Thank you.
120920,m334,the english patient,L183930,u5051,HANA,Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
120921,m334,the english patient,L183929,u5062,THE PATIENT,My book?  The Herodotus?  Yes we can read him.
120922,m334,the english patient,L183928,u5051,HANA,I think they're all in Italian but I'll look yes.  What about your own book?
120923,m334,the english patient,L183927,u5062,THE PATIENT,Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
120924,m334,the english patient,L183926,u5051,HANA,I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
120925,m334,the english patient,L183925,u5062,THE PATIENT,What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
120926,m334,the english patient,L183886,u5051,HANA,Because you're leaning?  No you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
120927,m334,the english patient,L183885,u5062,THE PATIENT,There was a Prince who was dying and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
120930,m334,the english patient,L183864,u5051,HANA,I'm not sewing anything else for you!
120932,m334,the english patient,L183862,u5051,HANA,No!
120934,m334,the english patient,L183860,u5051,HANA,I'm not sewing anything else.
120936,m334,the english patient,L184791,u5051,HANA,So one day we'll meet.
120938,m334,the english patient,L184789,u5051,HANA,I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
120940,m334,the english patient,L184787,u5051,HANA,I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
120941,m334,the english patient,L184786,u5051,HANA,I'm thinking about your heart not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
120943,m334,the english patient,L184784,u5051,HANA,Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
120945,m334,the english patient,L184782,u5051,HANA,Kip I -
120947,m334,the english patient,L184780,u5051,HANA,Of course.  When?
120949,m334,the english patient,L184756,u5051,HANA,Nya-nya-nya!
120952,m334,the english patient,L184753,u5051,HANA,I should go to the house get breakfast.
120955,m334,the english patient,L184750,u5051,HANA,What are you up to?
120956,m334,the english patient,L184649,u5051,HANA,You wouldn't come to find me?  That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban.
120958,m334,the english patient,L184647,u5051,HANA,But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
120960,m334,the english patient,L184645,u5051,HANA,If one night I didn't come to the tent what would you do?
120961,m334,the english patient,L184644,u5051,HANA,You loved him.
120964,m334,the english patient,L184624,u5051,HANA,Kip - come and dance with me
120966,m334,the english patient,L184607,u5051,HANA,Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward I can't love another dead man.
120968,m334,the english patient,L184514,u5051,HANA,Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
120970,m334,the english patient,L184512,u5051,HANA,Actually you can't cut can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
120972,m334,the english patient,L184510,u5051,HANA,I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
120974,m334,the english patient,L184508,u5051,HANA,I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
120977,m334,the english patient,L184503,u5051,HANA,Why would anyone do this?
120978,m334,the english patient,L184501,u5051,HANA,I follow the wires.
120980,m334,the english patient,L184499,u5051,HANA,So I follow the wires?
120982,m334,the english patient,L184497,u5051,HANA,What do I do?
120984,m334,the english patient,L184495,u5051,HANA,It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
120985,m334,the english patient,L184447,u5051,HANA,I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
120987,m334,the english patient,L184434,u5051,HANA,Yes for your hair.
120990,m334,the english patient,L184431,u5051,HANA,Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
120991,m334,the english patient,L184361,u5051,HANA,I don't think so.
120993,m334,the english patient,L184359,u5051,HANA,No but no not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
120995,m334,the english patient,L184357,u5051,HANA,I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
120997,m334,the english patient,L184355,u5051,HANA,Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
120998,m334,the english patient,L184295,u5051,HANA,Oh God.  Oh God.
121000,m334,the english patient,L184293,u5051,HANA,He's gone hasn't he?
121001,m334,the english patient,L184288,u5051,HANA,Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this whispers to Oliver.
121004,m334,the english patient,L184283,u5051,HANA,Why Picton?
121006,m334,the english patient,L183881,u5051,HANA,He can't even move.
121008,m334,the english patient,L183879,u5051,HANA,I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
121010,m334,the english patient,L183877,u5051,HANA,When he dies I'll catch up.
121012,m334,the english patient,L183875,u5051,HANA,The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
121013,m334,the english patient,L184604,u5051,HANA,What if you couldn't find him?  Sergeant not today please. Not this morning.
121015,m334,the english patient,L184602,u5051,HANA,Does he have to go?
121017,m334,the english patient,L184600,u5051,HANA,I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
121019,m334,the english patient,L184598,u5051,HANA,He's sleeping.
121022,m334,the english patient,L184427,u5051,HANA,You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
121024,m334,the english patient,L184425,u5051,HANA,Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear so please.
121026,m334,the english patient,L184423,u5051,HANA,I was going to say - if you want to eat with us ever you and Lieutenant Singh
121028,m334,the english patient,L184421,u5051,HANA,Hello.
121030,m334,the english patient,L184131,u5051,HANA,I thought that was for when we were very very old?
121032,m334,the english patient,L184129,u5051,HANA,I was looking forward to this evening.
121034,m334,the english patient,L184127,u5051,HANA,You've got a mustache.
121036,m334,the english patient,L184017,u5051,HANA,I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
121038,m334,the english patient,L184015,u5051,HANA,Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
121048,m334,the english patient,L184206,u5054,KATHARINE,I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all I'm the least able to dig and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
121051,m334,the english patient,L184165,u5054,KATHARINE,Darling Peter says I could stay
121053,m334,the english patient,L184068,u5054,KATHARINE,How awful.  What will you do?
121055,m334,the english patient,L184064,u5054,KATHARINE,Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino Herr Bermann.
121057,m334,the english patient,L183959,u5054,KATHARINE,It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges the son of somebody anyway - his favorite warrior -
121059,m334,the english patient,L184328,u5054,KATHARINE,No please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy who doesn't look up from his book.
121061,m334,the english patient,L184326,u5054,KATHARINE,I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
121063,m334,the english patient,L184324,u5054,KATHARINE,I don't think so.
121065,m334,the english patient,L184317,u5054,KATHARINE,Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert the trauma.
121067,m334,the english patient,L184776,u5062,THE PATIENT,Go on do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
121070,m334,the english patient,L184766,u5062,THE PATIENT,What are you talking about?
121072,m334,the english patient,L184764,u5062,THE PATIENT,Kip?
121074,m334,the english patient,L184456,u5062,THE PATIENT,This is wonderful!

121077,m334,the english patient,L184441,u5062,THE PATIENT,So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
121079,m334,the english patient,L184439,u5062,THE PATIENT,- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
121081,m334,the english patient,L184111,u5062,THE PATIENT,I think so.  Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
121083,m334,the english patient,L184109,u5062,THE PATIENT,Or my wife's.
121085,m334,the english patient,L184107,u5062,THE PATIENT,You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom right on the shore nothing between you and France.
121087,m334,the english patient,L184105,u5062,THE PATIENT,No.
121089,m334,the english patient,L184103,u5062,THE PATIENT,Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German which I can by the way.
121090,m334,the english patient,L184100,u5062,THE PATIENT,No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.
129162,m368,glengarry glen ross,L244438,u5522,AARONOW,If anyone's going I could use some coffee.

131990,m373,good will hunting,L250201,u5606,CHUCKIE,Well I don't have no trousers on...
131991,m373,good will hunting,L250200,u5616,SKYLAR,I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange doesn't it?
131992,m373,good will hunting,L250199,u5606,CHUCKIE,You caught that huh?
131993,m373,good will hunting,L250198,u5616,SKYLAR,See now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything he won't let me get close to him he tells me these weird lies--
131994,m373,good will hunting,L250197,u5606,CHUCKIE,Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
131995,m373,good will hunting,L250196,u5616,SKYLAR,Okay.
131996,m373,good will hunting,L250195,u5606,CHUCKIE,She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
131997,m373,good will hunting,L250194,u5616,SKYLAR,Is this a bad time?
131998,m373,good will hunting,L250193,u5606,CHUCKIE,What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by help out. I'm good like that.
131999,m373,good will hunting,L250192,u5616,SKYLAR,I guess so.
132000,m373,good will hunting,L250189,u5616,SKYLAR,This is your house right?
132001,m373,good will hunting,L250188,u5606,CHUCKIE,Oh right.
132002,m373,good will hunting,L250187,u5616,SKYLAR,You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
132003,m373,good will hunting,L250186,u5606,CHUCKIE,How'd you know where to find me?
132004,m373,good will hunting,L250185,u5616,SKYLAR,Good.
132005,m373,good will hunting,L250184,u5606,CHUCKIE,How you doin'?
132006,m373,good will hunting,L250183,u5616,SKYLAR,Hi.
132007,m373,good will hunting,L250072,u5616,SKYLAR,I wanted to meet your brothers...
132008,m373,good will hunting,L250071,u5606,CHUCKIE,Yeah not tonight. Not any other night. He knows once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.
132009,m373,good will hunting,L250060,u5616,SKYLAR,See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
132010,m373,good will hunting,L250059,u5606,CHUCKIE,I'm glad you came by changed my opinion of Harvard people.
132011,m373,good will hunting,L249585,u5606,CHUCKIE,Yah it's not a bad school...
132012,m373,good will hunting,L249584,u5616,SKYLAR,Oh...
132013,m373,good will hunting,L249583,u5606,CHUCKIE,Ah history I think.
132014,m373,good will hunting,L249582,u5616,SKYLAR,What class?
132015,m373,good will hunting,L249579,u5606,CHUCKIE,So you ladies ah go to school here?
132016,m373,good will hunting,L249578,u5616,SKYLAR,Okay.
132017,m373,good will hunting,L250447,u5606,CHUCKIE,Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car.
132019,m373,good will hunting,L250445,u5606,CHUCKIE,Me and Bill scraped together the parts worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
132021,m373,good will hunting,L250436,u5606,CHUCKIE,Hey asshole. Happy Birthday.
132022,m373,good will hunting,L250435,u5606,CHUCKIE,Shut the fuck up.
132024,m373,good will hunting,L250428,u5606,CHUCKIE,Oh Morgan.
132026,m373,good will hunting,L250426,u5606,CHUCKIE,Oh my God I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
132028,m373,good will hunting,L250281,u5606,CHUCKIE,Why don't you beat off at your house?
132030,m373,good will hunting,L250065,u5606,CHUCKIE,You're walkin' bitch Will's takin' the car.
132033,m373,good will hunting,L250057,u5606,CHUCKIE,It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
132034,m373,good will hunting,L250055,u5606,CHUCKIE,The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
132039,m373,good will hunting,L249570,u5606,CHUCKIE,My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
132041,m373,good will hunting,L249564,u5606,CHUCKIE,You got fired from pushing a broom you little bitch.
132043,m373,good will hunting,L249541,u5606,CHUCKIE,Morgan Let's go.
132045,m373,good will hunting,L249539,u5606,CHUCKIE,Shut up.
132047,m373,good will hunting,L249529,u5606,CHUCKIE,NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
132049,m373,good will hunting,L249525,u5606,CHUCKIE,I think you should establish a good line of credit.
132051,m373,good will hunting,L249523,u5606,CHUCKIE,Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
132053,m373,good will hunting,L249521,u5606,CHUCKIE,How much money you got?
132056,m373,good will hunting,L249517,u5606,CHUCKIE,Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered I was there!
132059,m373,good will hunting,L249504,u5606,CHUCKIE,What Morgan you're not gonna go talk to her?
132061,m373,good will hunting,L249497,u5606,CHUCKIE,You could put a pool in that backyard.
132063,m373,good will hunting,L249475,u5606,CHUCKIE,And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
132067,m373,good will hunting,L250150,u5606,CHUCKIE,Come now...what do you think I am a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine John I can cover the rest.
132071,m373,good will hunting,L250146,u5606,CHUCKIE,Allegedly what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.
132073,m373,good will hunting,L250144,u5606,CHUCKIE,Retainer...
132075,m373,good will hunting,L250140,u5606,CHUCKIE,--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
132078,m373,good will hunting,L249595,u5606,CHUCKIE,All right are we gonna have a problem?
132080,m373,good will hunting,L249593,u5606,CHUCKIE,To tell you the truth I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
132081,m373,good will hunting,L249591,u5606,CHUCKIE,Hey come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
132082,m373,good will hunting,L249589,u5606,CHUCKIE,Good it was all right.
132084,m373,good will hunting,L249587,u5606,CHUCKIE,History.
132086,m373,good will hunting,L250278,u5621,WILL,Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one.
132087,m373,good will hunting,L250276,u5621,WILL,Come on that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
132089,m373,good will hunting,L250274,u5621,WILL,Codebreaking.
132091,m373,good will hunting,L250272,u5621,WILL,So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
132093,m373,good will hunting,L249739,u5621,WILL,Down there.  And I'm nervous.
132095,m373,good will hunting,L249737,u5621,WILL,It's touching me.
132097,m373,good will hunting,L249735,u5621,WILL,It's like a small figure hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
132099,m373,good will hunting,L249733,u5621,WILL,Somethin's in my room.
132101,m373,good will hunting,L249731,u5621,WILL,Seven.
132105,m373,good will hunting,L250017,u5611,LAMBEAU,No there's a limit.
132107,m373,good will hunting,L250015,u5611,LAMBEAU,--But what he's doing he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
132109,m373,good will hunting,L250013,u5611,LAMBEAU,Alexander I know your theory. The boy is updating he's strategy stealing...
132111,m373,good will hunting,L249638,u5611,LAMBEAU,Please I'm a professor here and it's very important.
132112,m373,good will hunting,L249637,u5611,LAMBEAU,No no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
132114,m373,good will hunting,L249635,u5611,LAMBEAU,Building two.
132116,m373,good will hunting,L249633,u5611,LAMBEAU,Could you just check because the young man who works in my building--
132118,m373,good will hunting,L249631,u5611,LAMBEAU,I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
132120,m373,good will hunting,L249629,u5611,LAMBEAU,Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
132121,m373,good will hunting,L250481,u5611,LAMBEAU,Thank you Will. I'll do that.
132122,m373,good will hunting,L250480,u5621,WILL,Listen I'll be nearby so if you need some help or you get stuck again don't be afraid to give me a call.
132123,m373,good will hunting,L250479,u5611,LAMBEAU,Yes.
132124,m373,good will hunting,L250478,u5621,WILL,I appreciate that.
132125,m373,good will hunting,L250477,u5611,LAMBEAU,This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
132126,m373,good will hunting,L250476,u5621,WILL,Bullshit.
132127,m373,good will hunting,L250475,u5611,LAMBEAU,I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
132128,m373,good will hunting,L250474,u5621,WILL,Thank you.
132129,m373,good will hunting,L250473,u5611,LAMBEAU,Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week.
132130,m373,good will hunting,L250472,u5621,WILL,I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
132131,m373,good will hunting,L250471,u5611,LAMBEAU,You know you're no longer required to come here.
132132,m373,good will hunting,L250470,u5621,WILL,Hey how you doin'?
132133,m373,good will hunting,L250469,u5611,LAMBEAU,Will.
132134,m373,good will hunting,L250390,u5611,LAMBEAU,No that's fine Will. I was just leaving.
132135,m373,good will hunting,L250389,u5621,WILL,I can come back.
132136,m373,good will hunting,L250291,u5621,WILL,It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
132137,m373,good will hunting,L250290,u5611,LAMBEAU,What are you smiling at?
132138,m373,good will hunting,L250227,u5611,LAMBEAU,So am I.  Yes. That's right Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.
132139,m373,good will hunting,L250226,u5621,WILL,Well I'm sorry.
132140,m373,good will hunting,L250225,u5611,LAMBEAU,Sure then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
132141,m373,good will hunting,L250224,u5621,WILL,--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
132142,m373,good will hunting,L250223,u5611,LAMBEAU,The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
132143,m373,good will hunting,L250222,u5621,WILL,--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
132144,m373,good will hunting,L250221,u5611,LAMBEAU,I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
132145,m373,good will hunting,L250220,u5621,WILL,Then don't set up any more meetings.
132146,m373,good will hunting,L250219,u5611,LAMBEAU,Will on your own time you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting with my associates and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
132147,m373,good will hunting,L250218,u5621,WILL,I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
132148,m373,good will hunting,L250217,u5611,LAMBEAU,Will what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
132149,m373,good will hunting,L250216,u5621,WILL,It's right.  Take it home with you.
132150,m373,good will hunting,L250215,u5611,LAMBEAU,That's fine but did you ever think--
132151,m373,good will hunting,L250214,u5621,WILL,Can I ask you a favor can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
132152,m373,good will hunting,L250213,u5621,WILL,I'm pretty sure it's right.
132153,m373,good will hunting,L250212,u5611,LAMBEAU,--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
132154,m373,good will hunting,L250211,u5621,WILL,I don't know what it's called.
132155,m373,good will hunting,L250210,u5611,LAMBEAU,This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
132156,m373,good will hunting,L249830,u5611,LAMBEAU,Will this is Sean Maguire. Sean Will Hunting.
132157,m373,good will hunting,L249829,u5621,WILL,No.
132158,m373,good will hunting,L249750,u5611,LAMBEAU,That's enough.
132159,m373,good will hunting,L249749,u5621,WILL,Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
132160,m373,good will hunting,L249748,u5611,LAMBEAU,Get out Will.
132161,m373,good will hunting,L249747,u5621,WILL,C'mon that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
132162,m373,good will hunting,L249746,u5611,LAMBEAU,I told you to cooperate with these people.
132163,m373,good will hunting,L249745,u5621,WILL,Oh come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
132164,m373,good will hunting,L249744,u5611,LAMBEAU,Oh for God's sake Will.
132165,m373,good will hunting,L249728,u5621,WILL,Yeah when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
132166,m373,good will hunting,L249727,u5611,LAMBEAU,Shall we start the uh...
132167,m373,good will hunting,L249725,u5621,WILL,An integer.
132168,m373,good will hunting,L249724,u5611,LAMBEAU,--That edge!
132169,m373,good will hunting,L249723,u5621,WILL,--Half-red half-black--
132170,m373,good will hunting,L249722,u5611,LAMBEAU,--that?--
132171,m373,good will hunting,L249721,u5621,WILL,Half-red half-black--
132172,m373,good will hunting,L249720,u5611,LAMBEAU,What's that?
132173,m373,good will hunting,L249718,u5611,LAMBEAU,I happen to know so.
132174,m373,good will hunting,L249717,u5621,WILL,I think so.
132175,m373,good will hunting,L249716,u5611,LAMBEAU,That would be a monumental waste of time wouldn't it Will?
132176,m373,good will hunting,L249715,u5621,WILL,It's an integer proof.
132177,m373,good will hunting,L249714,u5611,LAMBEAU,Okay. How?
132178,m373,good will hunting,L249713,u5621,WILL,Of course.
132179,m373,good will hunting,L249712,u5611,LAMBEAU,This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
132180,m373,good will hunting,L249672,u5611,LAMBEAU,Now it won't be as bad as it sounds Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
132181,m373,good will hunting,L249671,u5621,WILL,I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
132182,m373,good will hunting,L249670,u5611,LAMBEAU,That's right.
132183,m373,good will hunting,L249669,u5621,WILL,If I agree to this I walk right now?
132184,m373,good will hunting,L249668,u5611,LAMBEAU,That you meet with me twice a week--
132185,m373,good will hunting,L249667,u5621,WILL,What're those?
132186,m373,good will hunting,L249666,u5611,LAMBEAU,Yes. Under two conditions.
132187,m373,good will hunting,L249665,u5621,WILL,Really?
132188,m373,good will hunting,L249664,u5611,LAMBEAU,I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
132189,m373,good will hunting,L249663,u5621,WILL,Fuck do you want?
132190,m373,good will hunting,L249662,u5611,LAMBEAU,Hello. Gerald Lambeau M.I.T.
132191,m373,good will hunting,L249560,u5611,LAMBEAU,Well... I'll be speaking to your supervisor.
132192,m373,good will hunting,L249559,u5621,WILL,Hey fuck you.
132193,m373,good will hunting,L249558,u5611,LAMBEAU,What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work you can't graffiti here.
132194,m373,good will hunting,L249557,u5621,WILL,I'm sorry.
132195,m373,good will hunting,L249556,u5611,LAMBEAU,What're you doing?
132196,m373,good will hunting,L249555,u5621,WILL,Oh I'm sorry.
132198,m373,good will hunting,L249493,u5611,LAMBEAU,Find out what?
132200,m373,good will hunting,L249491,u5611,LAMBEAU,It's Saturday.
132202,m373,good will hunting,L249489,u5611,LAMBEAU,Yes.
132204,m373,good will hunting,L250119,u5611,LAMBEAU,I did.
132207,m373,good will hunting,L250116,u5611,LAMBEAU,How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
132208,m373,good will hunting,L250115,u5611,LAMBEAU,You've heard of Albert Einstein?
132210,m373,good will hunting,L250113,u5611,LAMBEAU,Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
132212,m373,good will hunting,L250111,u5611,LAMBEAU,Excuse me Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
132213,m373,good will hunting,L250091,u5611,LAMBEAU,Pleasure to meet you.
132215,m373,good will hunting,L250504,u5611,LAMBEAU,About thirty million to one.
132216,m373,good will hunting,L250503,u5615,SEAN,You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
132217,m373,good will hunting,L250502,u5611,LAMBEAU,About thirty million to one.
132218,m373,good will hunting,L250501,u5615,SEAN,I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
132219,m373,good will hunting,L250500,u5611,LAMBEAU,Sean do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
132220,m373,good will hunting,L250499,u5615,SEAN,Sounds good.
132221,m373,good will hunting,L250498,u5611,LAMBEAU,How about one now?
132222,m373,good will hunting,L250495,u5615,SEAN,You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
132223,m373,good will hunting,L250494,u5611,LAMBEAU,I got one of those too.
132224,m373,good will hunting,L250493,u5615,SEAN,I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
132225,m373,good will hunting,L250492,u5611,LAMBEAU,Do you know when you'll be back?
132226,m373,good will hunting,L250491,u5615,SEAN,Never been.
132227,m373,good will hunting,L250490,u5611,LAMBEAU,Why there?
132228,m373,good will hunting,L250489,u5615,SEAN,I don't know. India maybe.
132229,m373,good will hunting,L250488,u5611,LAMBEAU,Where're you going?
132230,m373,good will hunting,L250487,u5615,SEAN,Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
132231,m373,good will hunting,L250486,u5611,LAMBEAU,So I hear you're taking some time.
132232,m373,good will hunting,L250485,u5615,SEAN,Me too.
132233,m373,good will hunting,L250484,u5611,LAMBEAU,Sean...
132234,m373,good will hunting,L250483,u5615,SEAN,Come in.
132235,m373,good will hunting,L250482,u5611,LAMBEAU,Hello Sean.
132236,m373,good will hunting,L250388,u5615,SEAN,He's not you!
132237,m373,good will hunting,L250387,u5611,LAMBEAU,You're wrong Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
132238,m373,good will hunting,L250386,u5615,SEAN,If you push him into something if you ride him--
132239,m373,good will hunting,L250385,u5611,LAMBEAU,He won't be a failure!
132240,m373,good will hunting,L250384,u5615,SEAN,I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
132241,m373,good will hunting,L250383,u5611,LAMBEAU,That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
132242,m373,good will hunting,L250382,u5615,SEAN,--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
132243,m373,good will hunting,L250381,u5611,LAMBEAU,--Is that what this is about Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
132244,m373,good will hunting,L250380,u5615,SEAN,That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
132245,m373,good will hunting,L250379,u5611,LAMBEAU,Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life to feel like a failure.
132246,m373,good will hunting,L250378,u5615,SEAN,--I don't have any anger at you--
132247,m373,good will hunting,L250377,u5611,LAMBEAU,--Yes you are Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
132248,m373,good will hunting,L250376,u5615,SEAN,--I'm not angry at you--
132249,m373,good will hunting,L250375,u5611,LAMBEAU,Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful for being what you could have been--
132250,m373,good will hunting,L250374,u5615,SEAN,--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
132251,m373,good will hunting,L250373,u5611,LAMBEAU,Oh that's nice--
132252,m373,good will hunting,L250372,u5615,SEAN,--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
132253,m373,good will hunting,L250371,u5611,LAMBEAU,Oh come on Sean--
132254,m373,good will hunting,L250370,u5615,SEAN,Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
132255,m373,good will hunting,L250369,u5611,LAMBEAU,He can handle the work he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
132256,m373,good will hunting,L250368,u5615,SEAN,Why do you think he does that Gerry?
132257,m373,good will hunting,L250367,u5611,LAMBEAU,What problems does he have Sean that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
132258,m373,good will hunting,L250366,u5615,SEAN,He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
132259,m373,good will hunting,L250365,u5611,LAMBEAU,He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
132260,m373,good will hunting,L250363,u5611,LAMBEAU,Look Sean I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
132261,m373,good will hunting,L250362,u5615,SEAN,I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
132262,m373,good will hunting,L250361,u5611,LAMBEAU,--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
132263,m373,good will hunting,L250360,u5615,SEAN,Hold on!
132264,m373,good will hunting,L250359,u5611,LAMBEAU,--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
132265,m373,good will hunting,L250358,u5615,SEAN,--Gerry--
132266,m373,good will hunting,L250357,u5611,LAMBEAU,--And confuse him--
132267,m373,good will hunting,L250356,u5615,SEAN,Now wait a minute--
132268,m373,good will hunting,L250355,u5611,LAMBEAU,This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy not to run him out--
132269,m373,good will hunting,L250136,u5611,LAMBEAU,That's a wonderful theory Sean. It worked wonders for you.
132270,m373,good will hunting,L250135,u5615,SEAN,Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
132271,m373,good will hunting,L250134,u5611,LAMBEAU,Look you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
132272,m373,good will hunting,L250133,u5615,SEAN,--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
132273,m373,good will hunting,L250132,u5611,LAMBEAU,--No no you hear me out Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
132274,m373,good will hunting,L250131,u5615,SEAN,Now wait a minute Gerry--
132275,m373,good will hunting,L250130,u5611,LAMBEAU,Sean this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
132276,m373,good will hunting,L250129,u5615,SEAN,Maybe he doesn't care about that.
132277,m373,good will hunting,L250128,u5611,LAMBEAU,Look I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
132278,m373,good will hunting,L250127,u5615,SEAN,Just...take it easy Gerry.
132279,m373,good will hunting,L250126,u5611,LAMBEAU,Well you're the only one.
132280,m373,good will hunting,L250125,u5615,SEAN,I do.
132281,m373,good will hunting,L250124,u5611,LAMBEAU,You see Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
132282,m373,good will hunting,L250123,u5615,SEAN,Einstein. Had two marriages both train-wrecks. The guy never saw his kids one of whom I think ended up in an asylum--
132283,m373,good will hunting,L250122,u5611,LAMBEAU,Who?
132284,m373,good will hunting,L250121,u5615,SEAN,He married his cousin.
132285,m373,good will hunting,L250110,u5615,SEAN,What don't I understand?
132286,m373,good will hunting,L250109,u5611,LAMBEAU,Sean I really don't think you understand--
132287,m373,good will hunting,L250108,u5615,SEAN,That's great Gerry that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
132288,m373,good will hunting,L250107,u5611,LAMBEAU,Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
132289,m373,good will hunting,L250106,u5615,SEAN,Jobs doing what?
132290,m373,good will hunting,L250105,u5615,SEAN,We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
132291,m373,good will hunting,L250104,u5611,LAMBEAU,Well have you talked to him at all about his future?
132292,m373,good will hunting,L250103,u5615,SEAN,I think so.
132293,m373,good will hunting,L250102,u5611,LAMBEAU,Seems like it's going well.
132294,m373,good will hunting,L250101,u5615,SEAN,I been here a couple years.
132295,m373,good will hunting,L250100,u5611,LAMBEAU,You moved?
132296,m373,good will hunting,L250099,u5615,SEAN,I live right around the corner.
132297,m373,good will hunting,L250098,u5611,LAMBEAU,You're here quite a bit then.
132298,m373,good will hunting,L250089,u5615,SEAN,Timmy this is Gerry an old friend of mine. We went to college together.
132299,m373,good will hunting,L250088,u5611,LAMBEAU,Not at all.
132300,m373,good will hunting,L250087,u5615,SEAN,Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
132301,m373,good will hunting,L249934,u5615,SEAN,I won't talk first.
132302,m373,good will hunting,L249932,u5615,SEAN,To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
132303,m373,good will hunting,L249931,u5611,LAMBEAU,Why would he do that?
132304,m373,good will hunting,L249930,u5615,SEAN,No he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive actually.
132305,m373,good will hunting,L249834,u5615,SEAN,You too Gerry.
132306,m373,good will hunting,L249833,u5611,LAMBEAU,Tom.
132307,m373,good will hunting,L249832,u5615,SEAN,Would you excuse us?
132308,m373,good will hunting,L249828,u5611,LAMBEAU,It's a poker game with this young man. Don't let him see what you've got.
132309,m373,good will hunting,L249827,u5615,SEAN,I'll be okay.
132310,m373,good will hunting,L249826,u5611,LAMBEAU,Any vulnerability he senses he'll exploit.
132311,m373,good will hunting,L249824,u5611,LAMBEAU,It's on the college.
132312,m373,good will hunting,L249823,u5615,SEAN,I got it.
132313,m373,good will hunting,L249822,u5611,LAMBEAU,That would be fine.
132314,m373,good will hunting,L249821,u5615,SEAN,Can we do it at my office?
132315,m373,good will hunting,L249820,u5611,LAMBEAU,Just meet with the boy once a week.
132316,m373,good will hunting,L249819,u5615,SEAN,Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
132317,m373,good will hunting,L249817,u5611,LAMBEAU,Five.
132318,m373,good will hunting,L249816,u5615,SEAN,He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
132319,m373,good will hunting,L249815,u5611,LAMBEAU,You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
132320,m373,good will hunting,L249814,u5615,SEAN,My kind of background?
132321,m373,good will hunting,L249813,u5611,LAMBEAU,I need someone with your kind of background.
132322,m373,good will hunting,L249812,u5615,SEAN,Why me?
132323,m373,good will hunting,L249811,u5611,LAMBEAU,They worked together for the remainder of their lives producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
132324,m373,good will hunting,L249810,u5615,SEAN,Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
132325,m373,good will hunting,L249809,u5611,LAMBEAU,--That's right Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
132326,m373,good will hunting,L249808,u5615,SEAN,And he mailed it to Hardy--
132327,m373,good will hunting,L249807,u5611,LAMBEAU,He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots not feathers...
132328,m373,good will hunting,L249806,u5615,SEAN,Yeah.
132329,m373,good will hunting,L249805,u5615,SEAN,Not much free time Gerry. LAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan?
132330,m373,good will hunting,L249804,u5611,LAMBEAU,This kid's special Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
132331,m373,good will hunting,L249803,u5615,SEAN,I've been busy Gerry. I got a full schedule.
132332,m373,good will hunting,L249784,u5615,SEAN,I got your card.
132333,m373,good will hunting,L249783,u5611,LAMBEAU,I'm sorry that damn conference--
132334,m373,good will hunting,L249782,u5615,SEAN,Since Nancy died.
132335,m373,good will hunting,L249781,u5611,LAMBEAU,You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
132336,m373,good will hunting,L249780,u5615,SEAN,I've been busy.
132337,m373,good will hunting,L249779,u5611,LAMBEAU,I didn't see you at the reunion.
132338,m373,good will hunting,L249765,u5611,LAMBEAU,Is there someplace we can talk?
132339,m373,good will hunting,L249764,u5615,SEAN,Good to see you.
132340,m373,good will hunting,L249763,u5611,LAMBEAU,Good to see you.
132341,m373,good will hunting,L249762,u5615,SEAN,The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
132342,m373,good will hunting,L249761,u5611,LAMBEAU,Hello.
132343,m373,good will hunting,L249760,u5615,SEAN,Well it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
132344,m373,good will hunting,L249759,u5611,LAMBEAU,Sean.
132345,m373,good will hunting,L250329,u5611,LAMBEAU,The boy was here. He came in sat down and we worked together.
132347,m373,good will hunting,L249756,u5611,LAMBEAU,He was my roommate in college.
132349,m373,good will hunting,L249754,u5611,LAMBEAU,There is somebody...
132351,m373,good will hunting,L249752,u5611,LAMBEAU,What's the point?
132353,m373,good will hunting,L250450,u5621,WILL,So what do you got a fuckin' Hyundai engine under there? Can I make it back to my house?
132355,m373,good will hunting,L250448,u5621,WILL,So you finally got a job Morgan?
132356,m373,good will hunting,L250042,u5621,WILL,Yeah Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
132358,m373,good will hunting,L249625,u5621,WILL,Hold up.
132360,m373,good will hunting,L249562,u5621,WILL,Yeah Morgan. I got fired.
132363,m373,good will hunting,L249534,u5621,WILL,Well she out did herself today...
132364,m373,good will hunting,L249506,u5621,WILL,I could go for a Whopper.
132366,m373,good will hunting,L249462,u5621,WILL,It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
132367,m373,good will hunting,L249706,u5621,WILL,You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey cheif--tell the wife at least. Christ set her free.
132369,m373,good will hunting,L249702,u5621,WILL,Look man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great Caeser Shakespeare Oscar Wilde Napoleon Gertrude Stein not to mention Danny Terrio not many straight men can dance like that.
132371,m373,good will hunting,L249700,u5621,WILL,I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house nice car -- your book's a best seller.
132373,m373,good will hunting,L249698,u5621,WILL,Buddy two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
132375,m373,good will hunting,L249696,u5621,WILL,C'mon I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
132377,m373,good will hunting,L249694,u5621,WILL,Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
132379,m373,good will hunting,L249692,u5621,WILL,Certain clubs.  Like Paradise. It's not bad.
132381,m373,good will hunting,L249690,u5621,WILL,I go places I interact.
132383,m373,good will hunting,L249688,u5621,WILL,No but I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
132385,m373,good will hunting,L249686,u5621,WILL,You're right. I know.
132387,m373,good will hunting,L249682,u5621,WILL,I could work the pit maybe but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
132389,m373,good will hunting,L249680,u5621,WILL,That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
132390,m373,good will hunting,L250468,u5615,SEAN,Good luck.
132391,m373,good will hunting,L250467,u5621,WILL,See ya.
132392,m373,good will hunting,L250466,u5615,SEAN,Only if you grab my ass.
132393,m373,good will hunting,L250465,u5621,WILL,Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
132394,m373,good will hunting,L250464,u5615,SEAN,No. Thank you.
132395,m373,good will hunting,L250462,u5615,SEAN,I'm gonna travel a little bit so I don't know where I'll be.

132402,m373,good will hunting,L250455,u5621,WILL,Yeah I think so.
132403,m373,good will hunting,L250454,u5615,SEAN,That's what you want?
132404,m373,good will hunting,L250453,u5621,WILL,Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
132405,m373,good will hunting,L250452,u5615,SEAN,Which one did you take Will?
132406,m373,good will hunting,L250422,u5621,WILL,I know I know...
132407,m373,good will hunting,L250421,u5615,SEAN,It's not...
132408,m373,good will hunting,L250420,u5621,WILL,I know.
132409,m373,good will hunting,L250419,u5615,SEAN,It's not your fault.
132410,m373,good will hunting,L250418,u5621,WILL,Don't fuck with me.
132411,m373,good will hunting,L250417,u5615,SEAN,It's not your fault.
132412,m373,good will hunting,L250416,u5621,WILL,I know.
132413,m373,good will hunting,L250415,u5615,SEAN,It's not your fault.
132414,m373,good will hunting,L250414,u5621,WILL,I know.
132415,m373,good will hunting,L250413,u5615,SEAN,It's not your fault.
132416,m373,good will hunting,L250412,u5621,WILL,I know.
132417,m373,good will hunting,L250411,u5615,SEAN,It's not your fault.
132418,m373,good will hunting,L250410,u5621,WILL,Oh I know.
132419,m373,good will hunting,L250408,u5621,WILL,Cause fuck him that's why.
132420,m373,good will hunting,L250407,u5615,SEAN,The wrench why?
132421,m373,good will hunting,L250406,u5621,WILL,I used to go with the wrench.
132422,m373,good will hunting,L250405,u5615,SEAN,Gotta go with the belt there...
132423,m373,good will hunting,L250401,u5621,WILL,It sure ain't good.
132424,m373,good will hunting,L250400,u5615,SEAN,Yes.
132425,m373,good will hunting,L250399,u5621,WILL,--No have you had any experience with that?
132426,m373,good will hunting,L250398,u5615,SEAN,Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
132427,m373,good will hunting,L250397,u5621,WILL,No.  Have you had any experience with that?
132428,m373,good will hunting,L250396,u5615,SEAN,You want to read it?
132429,m373,good will hunting,L250395,u5621,WILL,You're not going to fail me are you?
132430,m373,good will hunting,L250394,u5615,SEAN,Oh this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
132431,m373,good will hunting,L250393,u5621,WILL,Do you want to talk about it?
132432,m373,good will hunting,L250392,u5615,SEAN,Look a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
132433,m373,good will hunting,L250391,u5621,WILL,Well I'm here.  So is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy.
132434,m373,good will hunting,L250326,u5615,SEAN,Look at me. What do you want to do?
132435,m373,good will hunting,L250325,u5621,WILL,That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
132436,m373,good will hunting,L250324,u5615,SEAN,I been there. I played my hand.
132437,m373,good will hunting,L250323,u5621,WILL,What?
132438,m373,good will hunting,L250322,u5615,SEAN,If you won't answer my questions you're wasting my time.
132439,m373,good will hunting,L250321,u5621,WILL,What?
132440,m373,good will hunting,L250320,u5615,SEAN,You're right Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man.
132441,m373,good will hunting,L250319,u5621,WILL,Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
132442,m373,good will hunting,L250318,u5615,SEAN,Nobody gets what they ask for Will. That's a cop-out.
132443,m373,good will hunting,L250317,u5621,WILL,I didn't ask for this.
132444,m373,good will hunting,L250316,u5615,SEAN,It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
132445,m373,good will hunting,L250315,u5621,WILL,I didn't want the job.
132446,m373,good will hunting,L250314,u5615,SEAN,Don't give me you line of shit.
132447,m373,good will hunting,L250313,u5621,WILL,Oh what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
132448,m373,good will hunting,L250312,u5615,SEAN,That's what I'm saying Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
132449,m373,good will hunting,L250311,u5621,WILL,Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts no...
132450,m373,good will hunting,L250310,u5615,SEAN,But you can't give back to them Will.
132451,m373,good will hunting,L250309,u5621,WILL,Not to me they're not.
132452,m373,good will hunting,L250308,u5615,SEAN,They're all dead.
132453,m373,good will hunting,L250307,u5621,WILL,Yeah.
132454,m373,good will hunting,L250306,u5615,SEAN,Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
132455,m373,good will hunting,L250305,u5621,WILL,Define that.
132456,m373,good will hunting,L250304,u5615,SEAN,Do you have a soul-mate?
132457,m373,good will hunting,L250303,u5621,WILL,What?
132458,m373,good will hunting,L250302,u5615,SEAN,Do you think you're alone?
132459,m373,good will hunting,L250301,u5621,WILL,What did I think?
132460,m373,good will hunting,L250300,u5615,SEAN,What did you think?
132461,m373,good will hunting,L250299,u5621,WILL,I guess.
132462,m373,good will hunting,L250298,u5615,SEAN,Gerry says the meeting went well.
132463,m373,good will hunting,L250297,u5621,WILL,I don't know.
132464,m373,good will hunting,L250296,u5615,SEAN,So you might be working for Uncle Sam.
132465,m373,good will hunting,L250012,u5615,SEAN,Well hell I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
132466,m373,good will hunting,L250011,u5621,WILL,Would have been nice to catch that game though.
132467,m373,good will hunting,L250010,u5615,SEAN,No Will I'm not kiddin' you. If I had gone to see that game I'd be in here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago. And how I always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her. I don't regret the eighteen years we were married. I don't regret givin' up couseling for six years when she got sick. I don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. And I sure as Hell don't regret missing that damn game.
132468,m373,good will hunting,L250009,u5621,WILL,You're kiddin' me.
132469,m373,good will hunting,L250008,u5615,SEAN,They could see that I meant it.
132470,m373,good will hunting,L250005,u5621,WILL,I don't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar! That's game six of the World Series!
132471,m373,good will hunting,L250004,u5615,SEAN,You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
132472,m373,good will hunting,L250003,u5621,WILL,So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen you slept out for tickets games gonna start in twenty minutes in walks a girl you never seen before and you give your ticket away?
132473,m373,good will hunting,L250002,u5615,SEAN,That's right.
132474,m373,good will hunting,L250001,u5621,WILL,You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
132475,m373,good will hunting,L250000,u5615,SEAN,I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
132476,m373,good will hunting,L249999,u5621,WILL,Where were you?
132477,m373,good will hunting,L249998,u5615,SEAN,October 21 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning in steps Carlton Fisk hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
132478,m373,good will hunting,L249997,u5621,WILL,When did you know she was the one?
132479,m373,good will hunting,L249996,u5615,SEAN,Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
132480,m373,good will hunting,L249995,u5621,WILL,You don't regret meetin' your wife?
132481,m373,good will hunting,L249994,u5615,SEAN,What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
132482,m373,good will hunting,L249993,u5621,WILL,Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
132483,m373,good will hunting,L249992,u5615,SEAN,Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
132484,m373,good will hunting,L249991,u5621,WILL,What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
132485,m373,good will hunting,L249990,u5615,SEAN,Yeah.
132486,m373,good will hunting,L249989,u5621,WILL,Well I've read you colleagues. Your book was good Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
132487,m373,good will hunting,L249988,u5615,SEAN,I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
132488,m373,good will hunting,L249987,u5621,WILL,Is that why you didn't write anything else?
132489,m373,good will hunting,L249986,u5615,SEAN,I gave that up when my wife got sick.
132490,m373,good will hunting,L249985,u5621,WILL,Why not?
132491,m373,good will hunting,L249984,u5615,SEAN,No I don't.
132492,m373,good will hunting,L249983,u5615,SEAN,Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
132493,m373,good will hunting,L249967,u5621,WILL,Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
132494,m373,good will hunting,L249966,u5615,SEAN,My wife's dead.
132495,m373,good will hunting,L249965,u5621,WILL,Hence the word remarried.
132496,m373,good will hunting,L249964,u5615,SEAN,My wife's dead.
132497,m373,good will hunting,L249963,u5621,WILL,You ever think about gettin' remarried?
132498,m373,good will hunting,L249962,u5615,SEAN,I teach this shit I didn't say I knew how to do it.
132499,m373,good will hunting,L249960,u5615,SEAN,And right now you're perfect too. Maybe you don't want to ruin that.
132500,m373,good will hunting,L249959,u5621,WILL,Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect I don't want to ruin that.
132501,m373,good will hunting,L249958,u5615,SEAN,So Christ call her up.
132502,m373,good will hunting,L249957,u5621,WILL,I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart beautiful fun...
132503,m373,good will hunting,L249956,u5615,SEAN,Jesus Christ you are an amateur.
132504,m373,good will hunting,L249955,u5621,WILL,Haven't called her.
132505,m373,good will hunting,L249954,u5615,SEAN,Why not?
132506,m373,good will hunting,L249953,u5621,WILL,I don't know.
132507,m373,good will hunting,L249952,u5615,SEAN,Well are you going out again?
132508,m373,good will hunting,L249951,u5621,WILL,Fine.
132509,m373,good will hunting,L249950,u5615,SEAN,How'd it go?
132510,m373,good will hunting,L249949,u5621,WILL,Yeah I went on a date last week.
132511,m373,good will hunting,L249948,u5615,SEAN,Yeah? You got a lady now?
132512,m373,good will hunting,L249947,u5621,WILL,I know but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
132513,m373,good will hunting,L249946,u5615,SEAN,You've never been on a plane.
132514,m373,good will hunting,L249917,u5621,WILL,No.
132515,m373,good will hunting,L249916,u5615,SEAN,You've never been out of Boston.
132516,m373,good will hunting,L249915,u5621,WILL,Why thank you.
132517,m373,good will hunting,L249914,u5615,SEAN,You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
132518,m373,good will hunting,L249913,u5621,WILL,No.
132519,m373,good will hunting,L249912,u5615,SEAN,I was thinking about what you said to me the other day about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
132520,m373,good will hunting,L249911,u5621,WILL,So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
132521,m373,good will hunting,L249877,u5621,WILL,Time's up.
132522,m373,good will hunting,L249876,u5615,SEAN,If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
132523,m373,good will hunting,L249875,u5621,WILL,That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
132524,m373,good will hunting,L249874,u5615,SEAN,Watch your mouth.
132525,m373,good will hunting,L249873,u5621,WILL,Maybe you married the wrong woman.
132526,m373,good will hunting,L249872,u5615,SEAN,Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
132527,m373,good will hunting,L249871,u5615,SEAN,Maybe what mea--
132528,m373,good will hunting,L249870,u5621,WILL,--Well maybe that means you.
132529,m373,good will hunting,L249866,u5621,WILL,I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
132530,m373,good will hunting,L249865,u5615,SEAN,What is?
132531,m373,good will hunting,L249864,u5621,WILL,The color here see how dark it is? It's interesting.
132532,m373,good will hunting,L249863,u5615,SEAN,What does?
132533,m373,good will hunting,L249862,u5621,WILL,Poor color composition lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
132534,m373,good will hunting,L249861,u5615,SEAN,Tell me what you really think.
132535,m373,good will hunting,L249860,u5621,WILL,This is a real piece of shit.
132536,m373,good will hunting,L249859,u5615,SEAN,Crayons?
132537,m373,good will hunting,L249858,u5621,WILL,No.
132538,m373,good will hunting,L249857,u5615,SEAN,Yeah. Do you paint?
132539,m373,good will hunting,L249856,u5621,WILL,Oh.
132540,m373,good will hunting,L249855,u5615,SEAN,285.
132541,m373,good will hunting,L249854,u5615,SEAN,Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
132542,m373,good will hunting,L249853,u5621,WILL,Nautilus?
132543,m373,good will hunting,L249852,u5615,SEAN,Yes I do.
132544,m373,good will hunting,L249851,u5621,WILL,You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
132545,m373,good will hunting,L249850,u5615,SEAN,Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
132546,m373,good will hunting,L249849,u5621,WILL,Whatever blows your hair back.
132547,m373,good will hunting,L249848,u5615,SEAN,You think so?
132548,m373,good will hunting,L249847,u5621,WILL,You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
132549,m373,good will hunting,L249844,u5615,SEAN,Yeah it did take me a long time.
132550,m373,good will hunting,L249843,u5621,WILL,That must have taken you a long time.
132551,m373,good will hunting,L249842,u5615,SEAN,I did.
132552,m373,good will hunting,L249841,u5621,WILL,I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books why don't you read 'em?
132553,m373,good will hunting,L249840,u5615,SEAN,What did you think?
132554,m373,good will hunting,L249839,u5621,WILL,Yeah I read those.
132555,m373,good will hunting,L249838,u5615,SEAN,How about the ones on that shelf?
132556,m373,good will hunting,L249837,u5621,WILL,Probably not.
132557,m373,good will hunting,L249836,u5615,SEAN,Have you read all these books Will?
132558,m373,good will hunting,L250288,u5616,SKYLAR,Goodbye.
132559,m373,good will hunting,L250287,u5621,WILL,Take care.
132560,m373,good will hunting,L250286,u5616,SKYLAR,I love you Will.  No take-backs.
132561,m373,good will hunting,L250285,u5621,WILL,Yeah.
132562,m373,good will hunting,L250284,u5616,SKYLAR,I never cared about that.
132563,m373,good will hunting,L250283,u5621,WILL,I just wanted to call before you left.  I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker.
132564,m373,good will hunting,L250270,u5616,SKYLAR,You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
132565,m373,good will hunting,L250269,u5621,WILL,Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
132566,m373,good will hunting,L250266,u5616,SKYLAR,Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point that we're a team?
132567,m373,good will hunting,L250265,u5621,WILL,You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
132568,m373,good will hunting,L250264,u5616,SKYLAR,Yes I do Will.
132569,m373,good will hunting,L250263,u5621,WILL,No you don't want to hear that.
132570,m373,good will hunting,L250262,u5616,SKYLAR,Yes Will. I didn't even know that?
132571,m373,good will hunting,L250261,u5621,WILL,Oh is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
132572,m373,good will hunting,L250260,u5616,SKYLAR,What about your twelve brothers?
132573,m373,good will hunting,L250259,u5621,WILL,I'm not honest?
132574,m373,good will hunting,L250258,u5616,SKYLAR,You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
132575,m373,good will hunting,L250257,u5621,WILL,What the fuck am I afraid of?!
132576,m373,good will hunting,L250256,u5616,SKYLAR,Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
132577,m373,good will hunting,L250255,u5621,WILL,At least you have a mother.
132578,m373,good will hunting,L250254,u5616,SKYLAR,I inherited that money when I was thirteen when my father died.
132579,m373,good will hunting,L250253,u5621,WILL,--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
132580,m373,good will hunting,L250252,u5616,SKYLAR,Is that what you think--
132581,m373,good will hunting,L250251,u5621,WILL,--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
132582,m373,good will hunting,L250250,u5616,SKYLAR,Well what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
132583,m373,good will hunting,L250249,u5621,WILL,What am I scared of?
132584,m373,good will hunting,L250248,u5616,SKYLAR,Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
132585,m373,good will hunting,L250246,u5616,SKYLAR,Then what are you afraid of?
132586,m373,good will hunting,L250245,u5621,WILL,I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
132587,m373,good will hunting,L250244,u5616,SKYLAR,Look Will if you're not in love with me you can say that.
132588,m373,good will hunting,L250243,u5621,WILL,One because I have a job here and two because I live here--
132589,m373,good will hunting,L250242,u5616,SKYLAR,Why not?
132590,m373,good will hunting,L250241,u5621,WILL,I can't go out to California.
132591,m373,good will hunting,L250238,u5616,SKYLAR,Yeah I'm sure.
132592,m373,good will hunting,L250237,u5621,WILL,And you're sure about that?
132593,m373,good will hunting,L250236,u5616,SKYLAR,I don't know. I just feel it.
132594,m373,good will hunting,L250235,u5621,WILL,Yeah but how do you know?
132595,m373,good will hunting,L250234,u5616,SKYLAR,I know. I just do.
132596,m373,good will hunting,L250233,u5621,WILL,How do you know that?
132597,m373,good will hunting,L250232,u5616,SKYLAR,I want you to come with me.
132598,m373,good will hunting,L250231,u5621,WILL,What?
132599,m373,good will hunting,L250230,u5616,SKYLAR,Come with me to California.
132600,m373,good will hunting,L250229,u5621,WILL,No.
132601,m373,good will hunting,L250228,u5616,SKYLAR,Will? Are you awake?
132602,m373,good will hunting,L250180,u5621,WILL,--When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.
132603,m373,good will hunting,L250179,u5616,SKYLAR,--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour you can--
132604,m373,good will hunting,L250178,u5621,WILL,Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven Mozart they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
132605,m373,good will hunting,L250177,u5616,SKYLAR,So do you play the piano?
132606,m373,good will hunting,L250176,u5621,WILL,Well all right Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
132607,m373,good will hunting,L250168,u5621,WILL,I guess so.
132608,m373,good will hunting,L250167,u5616,SKYLAR,Just for fun?
132609,m373,good will hunting,L250166,u5621,WILL,Some a little.
132610,m373,good will hunting,L250165,u5616,SKYLAR,Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
132611,m373,good will hunting,L250164,u5621,WILL,I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
132612,m373,good will hunting,L250163,u5616,SKYLAR,All right Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
132613,m373,good will hunting,L250162,u5621,WILL,Instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke? SKYLAR No so I can be a doctor.
132614,m373,good will hunting,L250161,u5616,SKYLAR,Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me minus about five hundred bucks to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe substantially.
132615,m373,good will hunting,L250160,u5621,WILL,You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
132616,m373,good will hunting,L250159,u5616,SKYLAR,Clearly.
132617,m373,good will hunting,L250158,u5621,WILL,Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
132618,m373,good will hunting,L250157,u5616,SKYLAR,It's important that I learn this.
132619,m373,good will hunting,L250156,u5621,WILL,C'mon give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
132620,m373,good will hunting,L250155,u5616,SKYLAR,No.
132621,m373,good will hunting,L250154,u5621,WILL,Want me to take a look?
132622,m373,good will hunting,L250153,u5616,SKYLAR,Fine.
132623,m373,good will hunting,L250152,u5621,WILL,How's it goin'?
132624,m373,good will hunting,L250070,u5621,WILL,Not tonight.
132625,m373,good will hunting,L250069,u5616,SKYLAR,I thought you said you'd show me your place.
132626,m373,good will hunting,L250040,u5621,WILL,Then on behalf of my weiner I'd like to ask for an advance.
132627,m373,good will hunting,L250039,u5616,SKYLAR,You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
132628,m373,good will hunting,L250038,u5621,WILL,I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin' they're prob'ly up.
132629,m373,good will hunting,L250037,u5616,SKYLAR,What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
132630,m373,good will hunting,L250036,u5621,WILL,Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
132631,m373,good will hunting,L250035,u5616,SKYLAR,When?
132632,m373,good will hunting,L250034,u5621,WILL,All right all right. We'll go.
132633,m373,good will hunting,L250033,u5616,SKYLAR,Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
132634,m373,good will hunting,L250032,u5621,WILL,Aah it's kind of a hike.
132635,m373,good will hunting,L250031,u5616,SKYLAR,I think I can make it to South Boston.
132636,m373,good will hunting,L250030,u5621,WILL,They don't come over here that much.
132637,m373,good will hunting,L250029,u5616,SKYLAR,What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
132638,m373,good will hunting,L250028,u5621,WILL,Exactly.
132639,m373,good will hunting,L250027,u5616,SKYLAR,I've never seen your place.
132640,m373,good will hunting,L250026,u5621,WILL,'Cause it's nicer than my place.
132641,m373,good will hunting,L250025,u5616,SKYLAR,Why do we always stay here?
132642,m373,good will hunting,L249982,u5621,WILL,Then let's go have some fun.
132643,m373,good will hunting,L249981,u5616,SKYLAR,No.
132644,m373,good will hunting,L249980,u5621,WILL,You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
132645,m373,good will hunting,L249979,u5616,SKYLAR,I'm supposed to understand this.
132646,m373,good will hunting,L249978,u5621,WILL,Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
132647,m373,good will hunting,L249977,u5616,SKYLAR,How the hell did you do that?
132648,m373,good will hunting,L249976,u5621,WILL,I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
132649,m373,good will hunting,L249975,u5616,SKYLAR,If you bring the caramels.

132663,m373,good will hunting,L249900,u5621,WILL,It was great. There was always someone to play with give you advice.
132664,m373,good will hunting,L249899,u5616,SKYLAR,Your house must have been a zoo.
132665,m373,good will hunting,L249898,u5621,WILL,I swear to God.

132679,m373,good will hunting,L249884,u5621,WILL,Pretty boring I guess.
132680,m373,good will hunting,L249883,u5616,SKYLAR,How was that?
132681,m373,good will hunting,L249882,u5621,WILL,Not far from here South Boston.
132682,m373,good will hunting,L249881,u5616,SKYLAR,You grew up around here?
132683,m373,good will hunting,L249802,u5621,WILL,Hey I spent all my money on those caramels.
132684,m373,good will hunting,L249801,u5616,SKYLAR,Free?
132685,m373,good will hunting,L249797,u5616,SKYLAR,Then why don't we just get it out of the way.
132686,m373,good will hunting,L249796,u5621,WILL,No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
132687,m373,good will hunting,L249795,u5616,SKYLAR,Oh you will?
132688,m373,good will hunting,L249793,u5616,SKYLAR,Yes you were.

132690,m373,good will hunting,L249791,u5616,SKYLAR,Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
132691,m373,good will hunting,L249790,u5621,WILL,No I haven't...
132692,m373,good will hunting,L249789,u5616,SKYLAR,You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
132693,m373,good will hunting,L249788,u5621,WILL,I really don't 'date' that much.
132694,m373,good will hunting,L249787,u5616,SKYLAR,Well there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing.
132695,m373,good will hunting,L249786,u5621,WILL,No.
132696,m373,good will hunting,L249785,u5616,SKYLAR,Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
132697,m373,good will hunting,L249777,u5616,SKYLAR,Okay...
132698,m373,good will hunting,L249776,u5621,WILL,Now I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
132699,m373,good will hunting,L249775,u5616,SKYLAR,Sure.
132700,m373,good will hunting,L249774,u5621,WILL,In that case fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
132701,m373,good will hunting,L249773,u5616,SKYLAR,Well I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class then go.
132702,m373,good will hunting,L249772,u5621,WILL,So you just want to use me and go?
132703,m373,good will hunting,L249771,u5616,SKYLAR,Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
132704,m373,good will hunting,L249770,u5621,WILL,Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
132705,m373,good will hunting,L249769,u5616,SKYLAR,I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
132706,m373,good will hunting,L249768,u5621,WILL,I bet your parents were happy to pay.
132707,m373,good will hunting,L249767,u5616,SKYLAR,I don't know it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school Harvard and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
132708,m373,good will hunting,L249661,u5621,WILL,You aren't by any chance Pre-law? Are you?
132709,m373,good will hunting,L249660,u5616,SKYLAR,Sounds good where are you now?
132710,m373,good will hunting,L249659,u5621,WILL,Yeah I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
132711,m373,good will hunting,L249658,u5616,SKYLAR,Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
132712,m373,good will hunting,L249657,u5621,WILL,Okay you got me. It's the ugly obnoxious toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
132713,m373,good will hunting,L249656,u5616,SKYLAR,I'm sorry I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
132714,m373,good will hunting,L249655,u5621,WILL,It's Will the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
132715,m373,good will hunting,L249654,u5616,SKYLAR,Yeah?
132716,m373,good will hunting,L249622,u5621,WILL,The caramel thing is my pick-up line.
132717,m373,good will hunting,L249621,u5616,SKYLAR,See it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
132718,m373,good will hunting,L249620,u5621,WILL,I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
132719,m373,good will hunting,L249619,u5616,SKYLAR,What?
132720,m373,good will hunting,L249618,u5621,WILL,Five minutes.
132721,m373,good will hunting,L249617,u5616,SKYLAR,Okay sounds good.
132722,m373,good will hunting,L249616,u5621,WILL,When you think about it it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.

134760,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262045,u5746,HANNAH,Hi!  Hi!
134762,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262580,u5746,HANNAH,True.
134764,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262578,u5746,HANNAH,Now Holly's not shy.
134766,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262576,u5746,HANNAH,I just had a lot of luck...from my first show you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
134767,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262571,u5746,HANNAH,Yeah I know Mom. NORMA  But I I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
134769,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262569,u5746,HANNAH,Okay okay.
134771,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262567,u5746,HANNAH,Okay stop being so dramatic.
134773,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262565,u5746,HANNAH,You promised to stay on the wagon.
134775,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262563,u5746,HANNAH,Here Mom.  Drink this.  You know you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
134776,m380,hannah and her sisters,L261944,u5746,HANNAH,...from Mavis also.
134778,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263037,u5747,HOLLY,No he hasn't.  If I offended you I'm sorry.
134779,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263036,u5746,HANNAH,I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
134780,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263035,u5747,HOLLY,That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
134781,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263034,u5746,HANNAH,I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
134782,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263033,u5747,HOLLY,Well why don't you share them with us?
134783,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263032,u5746,HANNAH,Yeah we're having some problems but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
134784,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263031,u5747,HOLLY,Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
134785,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263030,u5747,HOLLY,Oh wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong.
134786,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263029,u5746,HANNAH,You're grateful but you resent me.
134787,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263027,u5746,HANNAH,You make it sound like you know I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
134788,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263026,u5747,HOLLY,Wow I guess I hit a nerve.
134789,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263021,u5746,HANNAH,Can I can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I do I put people off?
134790,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263020,u5747,HOLLY,Well--
134791,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263018,u5747,HOLLY,Oh so loosely.
134792,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263017,u5746,HANNAH,It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
134793,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263016,u5747,HOLLY,My script?
134794,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263015,u5746,HANNAH,I'm real upset about what you wrote.
134795,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263014,u5747,HOLLY,Hey what's the matter?
134796,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262977,u5746,HANNAH,Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
134797,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262976,u5747,HOLLY,Good.
134798,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262975,u5746,HANNAH,Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
134799,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262974,u5747,HOLLY,What's the matter?
134800,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262973,u5746,HANNAH,Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
134801,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262972,u5747,HOLLY,What's the matter with you Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
134802,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262966,u5747,HOLLY,Hey Hannah I know I'm mediocre.
134803,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262965,u5746,HANNAH,You're crazy!  That's not true.
134804,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262964,u5747,HOLLY,You know I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
134805,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262963,u5746,HANNAH,You're too demanding.
134806,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262962,u5747,HOLLY,Uh losers!  All losers!
134807,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262961,u5746,HANNAH,I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
134808,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262960,u5747,HOLLY,Hmm!
134809,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262959,u5746,HANNAH,Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest constructive advice.
134810,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262958,u5747,HOLLY,You never have any faith in my plans.  You always undercut my enthusiasm.
134811,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262957,u5746,HANNAH,How?
134812,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262956,u5747,HOLLY,You treat me like a loser.
134813,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262949,u5747,HOLLY,Yeah you mean not at my age.
134814,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262947,u5747,HOLLY,Boy I knew you'd be discouraging.
134815,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262946,u5746,HANNAH,No.  She didn't she say it was um...she said it was in the publicity department.  That-that can lead to other things.
134816,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262945,u5747,HOLLY,Yeah that's clerical.
134817,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262944,u5746,HANNAH,Well I don't know.  We'd uh uh um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
134818,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262943,u5747,HOLLY,Well-well like what?
134819,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262942,u5746,HANNAH,Well that-that's good.  It just uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year if-if you spent it more productively...
134820,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262940,u5747,HOLLY,But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah I think I've had it with acting.  You know these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta you know latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months you know or uh a year even.
134821,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262939,u5746,HANNAH,Well that...th-that's fine.
134822,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262938,u5747,HOLLY,Yeah although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient but...I have to borrow some more money. 
134823,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262937,u5746,HANNAH,Oh God...
134824,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262932,u5747,HOLLY,You got it.
134825,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262931,u5746,HANNAH,Oh gosh.
134826,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262928,u5746,HANNAH,Oh what do they know?
134827,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262927,u5747,HOLLY,They said I was too offbeat looking whatever the hell that means.
134828,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262926,u5746,HANNAH,Boy--
134829,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262925,u5747,HOLLY,So what's new?

134836,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262827,u5746,HANNAH,What?  You don't don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
134837,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262826,u5747,HOLLY,Boy you really know how to cut me down.
134838,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262825,u5746,HANNAH,I hope.
134839,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262824,u5747,HOLLY,Yeah.  Well maybe I'll get it. 
134840,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262823,u5746,HANNAH,...every eh single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent or something?

134847,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262816,u5746,HANNAH,No I'm sorry.  No I didn't mean that.  No I didn't mean that.
134848,m380,hannah and her sisters,L262815,u5747,HOLLY,I mean y-you know don't say it that way you know because my confidence is not my strong point I--

134904,m380,hannah and her sisters,L261825,u5747,HOLLY,You admit that we're great cooks right?
134905,m380,hannah and her sisters,L261824,u5747,HOLLY,Hannah I know it's a lot but my friend April and I we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
134906,m380,hannah and her sisters,L261823,u5746,HANNAH,Uh-huh.
134907,m380,hannah and her sisters,L261822,u5747,HOLLY,Two thousand dollars.

134912,m380,hannah and her sisters,L261817,u5746,HANNAH,Mmm I never get upset over that. Mmm?
134913,m380,hannah and her sisters,L261816,u5747,HOLLY,Hannah I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
134914,m380,hannah and her sisters,L261814,u5746,HANNAH,Oh sure.
134915,m380,hannah and her sisters,L261813,u5747,HOLLY,Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
134916,m380,hannah and her sisters,L261808,u5747,HOLLY,Mmm...I mean we love to cook for our friends so  we thought until an acting job comes through we could just make some extra money you know doing a few private parties.
134917,m380,hannah and her sisters,L261807,u5746,HANNAH,Perfect!
134918,m380,hannah and her sisters,L261806,u5747,HOLLY,No no we decided!
134919,m380,hannah and her sisters,L261805,u5746,HANNAH,What?  You're kidding!

134923,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263260,u5750,MICKEY,I don't know how you're gonna top that.
134924,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263259,u5747,HOLLY,Tch.
134925,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263258,u5750,MICKEY,You know I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's you know it's a...
134926,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263257,u5747,HOLLY,Thanks.

134942,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263214,u5750,MICKEY,Oh yeah?  What?
134943,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263213,u5747,HOLLY,Um...look there's something I've uh that's been bothering me for a long time and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here and  that's this.
134944,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263192,u5750,MICKEY,Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...

134950,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263186,u5747,HOLLY,Uh gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh uh...
134951,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263185,u5750,MICKEY,It was just great.  Uh I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
134952,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263184,u5747,HOLLY,Oh wow!

134959,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263177,u5750,MICKEY,I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself but...
134960,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263176,u5747,HOLLY,Oh gosh you really think I can write?
134961,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263175,u5750,MICKEY,Well it was just fabulous!  I'm I you know...
134962,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263174,u5747,HOLLY,Oh it just came to me one day.
134963,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263173,u5750,MICKEY,Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?

134984,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263149,u5750,MICKEY,You have to remember we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
134985,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263148,u5747,HOLLY,Well I'd love it if you'd read it actually 'cause I really would value your opinion.

134991,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263142,u5747,HOLLY,Oh.  Oh.
134992,m380,hannah and her sisters,L263141,u5750,MICKEY,I may I may have to get back into it 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but um no I haven't I just sort of dropped out for a year...

139927,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324744,u6107,CARLA,You want to try your hand at something...?
139928,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324483,u6107,CARLA,You're not interfering Ellen....

139935,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324476,u6109,ELLEN,Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?

140024,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324987,u6114,MICHAEL,I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
140025,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324986,u6109,ELLEN,It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
140026,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324985,u6114,MICHAEL,I don't want to talk about that.
140027,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324984,u6109,ELLEN,You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....

140100,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324914,u6109,ELLEN,The whole idea is preposterous....
140101,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324913,u6110,HOAGIE,There's nothing to be sorry about.
140102,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324912,u6109,ELLEN,I'm sorry...I....
140103,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324911,u6110,HOAGIE,Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
140104,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324910,u6109,ELLEN,Why?
140105,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324909,u6110,HOAGIE,I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you Ellen Brody.

140108,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324906,u6110,HOAGIE,Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
140109,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324905,u6109,ELLEN,Won't you get in trouble...?
140110,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324904,u6110,HOAGIE,I borrow it without telling him....
140111,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324903,u6109,ELLEN,What?
140112,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324902,u6110,HOAGIE,I'll nick the boss' plane again....

140114,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324900,u6109,ELLEN,You're always taking time off....
140115,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324899,u6110,HOAGIE,I could take some time off....
140116,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324898,u6110,HOAGIE,I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while....
140117,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324897,u6109,ELLEN,That's hard to imagine....
140118,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324896,u6110,HOAGIE,I tried winter once.  Burlington Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
140119,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324895,u6110,HOAGIE,But it gets cold in winter....
140120,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324894,u6109,ELLEN,I have my own little island.
140121,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324893,u6110,HOAGIE,Our little island seems to agree with you....
140122,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324799,u6109,ELLEN,Good.  I have two left....
140123,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324798,u6110,HOAGIE,I have two right feet.
140124,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324797,u6109,ELLEN,You'll be sorry.
140125,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324796,u6110,HOAGIE,Would you suffer through a dance with me?
140126,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324753,u6109,ELLEN,No!
140127,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324752,u6110,HOAGIE,All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
140128,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324751,u6109,ELLEN,You're not going to bet it all....
140129,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324750,u6110,HOAGIE,Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell maybe my own airline....
140130,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324723,u6110,HOAGIE,A big one....
140131,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324722,u6109,ELLEN,A big one....
140132,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324721,u6110,HOAGIE,A drink with an umbrella in it....
140133,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324719,u6110,HOAGIE,Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
140134,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324718,u6109,ELLEN,The kind with an umbrella in it....
140135,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324717,u6110,HOAGIE,Sharks come and go Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
140136,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324716,u6109,ELLEN,You promised me a drink....
140137,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324712,u6109,ELLEN,I'm terrific... Come on....
140138,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324711,u6110,HOAGIE,No you're not....
140139,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324710,u6109,ELLEN,I'm fine.
140140,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324709,u6109,ELLEN,Nothing....
140141,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324708,u6110,HOAGIE,What's wrong?
140142,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324687,u6109,ELLEN,It's wonderful....
140143,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324686,u6110,HOAGIE,How do you like flying?
140144,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324683,u6109,ELLEN,The plane's turning....
140145,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324682,u6110,HOAGIE,They took me to the chief who took a long look at me then took me in his hut....
140146,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324681,u6109,ELLEN,You're impossible....
140147,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324680,u6110,HOAGIE,Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
140148,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324679,u6109,ELLEN,You're not going to tell me are you?
140149,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324678,u6110,HOAGIE,One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
140150,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324677,u6109,ELLEN,I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
140151,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324675,u6110,HOAGIE,You're doing fine.  I'll keep you out of trouble.  Relax....
140152,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324674,u6109,ELLEN,Where do I pull off...?
140153,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324673,u6110,HOAGIE,It's just like driving a car....
140154,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324671,u6110,HOAGIE,If you don't take it we'll be swimming in a minute.
140155,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324670,u6109,ELLEN,What are you doing?
140156,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324669,u6110,HOAGIE,No one does till they learn....
140157,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324668,u6109,ELLEN,I don't know how....
140158,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324667,u6110,HOAGIE,Sure you can....
140159,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324666,u6109,ELLEN,I can't....
140160,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324665,u6110,HOAGIE,Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
140161,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324664,u6109,ELLEN,How can you just take the plane like this?
140162,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324658,u6109,ELLEN,Doesn't matter....
140163,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324657,u6110,HOAGIE,Depends on where you want to go....
140164,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324654,u6109,ELLEN,When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming....
140165,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324653,u6110,HOAGIE,I'm not saying you're wrong just that there are other possibilities....
140166,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324652,u6109,ELLEN,It was no accident....
140167,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324651,u6110,HOAGIE,It could have been an accident....
140168,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324650,u6109,ELLEN,Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
140169,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324649,u6110,HOAGIE,I always listen to my feelings....
140170,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324648,u6109,ELLEN,I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
140171,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324647,u6110,HOAGIE,Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
140172,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324646,u6109,ELLEN,I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
140173,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324617,u6110,HOAGIE,Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
140174,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324616,u6109,ELLEN,Flies the plane....
140175,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324388,u6110,HOAGIE,I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
140176,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324387,u6109,ELLEN,Can you just go off...?
140177,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324380,u6109,ELLEN,You must get bored easily.
140178,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324379,u6110,HOAGIE,First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
140179,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324378,u6109,ELLEN,No....
140180,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325267,u6110,HOAGIE,I own the airplane.  I can do whatever I want.  I'm the boss.
140182,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325265,u6110,HOAGIE,Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
140183,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324660,u6110,HOAGIE,Just like that?
140186,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324619,u6110,HOAGIE,You the architect?
140188,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324614,u6110,HOAGIE,I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware Hoagie's here....'
140190,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324385,u6110,HOAGIE,Want to go for a little ride?
140191,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324377,u6110,HOAGIE,The wind does that.  Ever been to the Bahamas before?
140193,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324375,u6110,HOAGIE,I'll get it back next time.
140195,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324367,u6110,HOAGIE,I have coffee in the thermos.
140197,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325227,u6110,HOAGIE,Aye aye Captain....
140198,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325226,u6112,JAKE,Keep it steady....
140199,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325199,u6112,JAKE,They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
140200,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325198,u6110,HOAGIE,Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
140201,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325194,u6112,JAKE,Get her started....
140202,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325193,u6110,HOAGIE,What say we get the hell out of here Ellen Brody. ...
140203,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325178,u6110,HOAGIE,Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
140204,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325177,u6112,JAKE,It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
140205,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325176,u6110,HOAGIE,Hell that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
140206,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325174,u6110,HOAGIE,Hell no.  What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
140207,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325173,u6112,JAKE,You sure you know how to do this.
140208,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325172,u6110,HOAGIE,Grab your socks....
140209,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325131,u6110,HOAGIE,She said it was coming....
140210,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325130,u6112,JAKE,What do you mean it'll find her?
140211,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325128,u6112,JAKE,She'll be all right partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
140212,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325127,u6110,HOAGIE,When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
140213,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325124,u6112,JAKE,You got a better idea...?
140214,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325123,u6110,HOAGIE,You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
140215,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325121,u6112,JAKE,A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
140216,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325120,u6110,HOAGIE,I hope she's a good sailor....
140217,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324758,u6112,JAKE,We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
140218,m405,jaws: the revenge,L324757,u6110,HOAGIE,It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
140219,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325239,u6114,MICHAEL,It needs more time to charge.
140220,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325238,u6110,HOAGIE,The damn thing is going to have our asses....
140221,m405,jaws: the revenge,L325234,u6110,HOAGIE,Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?

144836,m428,magnolia,L362593,u6434,JIM KURRING,No no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
144837,m428,magnolia,L362592,u6420,CLAUDIA,What is it?  Did you forget something?

144860,m428,magnolia,L362341,u6420,CLAUDIA,You won't.  You won't have to.
144861,m428,magnolia,L362340,u6434,JIM KURRING,I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
144862,m428,magnolia,L362339,u6420,CLAUDIA,It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
144863,m428,magnolia,L362338,u6434,JIM KURRING,It's where situations like these lead Claudia unless you do something about it early if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
144864,m428,magnolia,L362337,u6420,CLAUDIA,It's not -- what's a 422?
144865,m428,magnolia,L362336,u6434,JIM KURRING,Many times in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak but I have to tell you that being a police officer I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak next thing you know I'm gettin' a call on the radio I got a 422 --
144866,m428,magnolia,L362335,u6420,CLAUDIA,-- is not my boyfriend.
144867,m428,magnolia,L362334,u6434,JIM KURRING,The gentleman who came to the door --
144868,m428,magnolia,L362333,u6420,CLAUDIA,I don't have a boyfriend.

144870,m428,magnolia,L362331,u6434,JIM KURRING,Arlight then.  Cheers.
144871,m428,magnolia,L362330,u6420,CLAUDIA,Yeah.
144872,m428,magnolia,L362329,u6434,JIM KURRING,That'd be fine.  So Claudia lemme just say so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here people that work from their homes people tryin' to get some work done and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud but hey forget about the neighbors you end up damaging your own ears ok?
144873,m428,magnolia,L362328,u6420,CLAUDIA,You take cream or sugar?
144874,m428,magnolia,L362327,u6434,JIM KURRING,Oh it'll be fine I'm sure Claudia.
144875,m428,magnolia,L362326,u6420,CLAUDIA,I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
144876,m428,magnolia,L362325,u6434,JIM KURRING,That's great thank you.
144877,m428,magnolia,L362324,u6420,CLAUDIA,-- do you wanna cup?
144878,m428,magnolia,L362323,u6434,JIM KURRING,I like iced coffee generally but a day like this rain and what not I enjoy a warm cup --
144879,m428,magnolia,L362322,u6420,CLAUDIA,Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --

147483,m435,meet joe black,L376267,u6548,DREW,Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
147484,m435,meet joe black,L376266,u6551,JOE,But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
147485,m435,meet joe black,L376265,u6548,DREW,Who are we talking about?

And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay pal?  Let's eat.
147487,m435,meet joe black,L376230,u6551,JOE,No.

147519,m435,meet joe black,L376761,u6548,DREW,Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another one of his whoppers?  Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is but one thing everyone does know he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
147520,m435,meet joe black,L376760,u6552,PARRISH,The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.

147529,m435,meet joe black,L376440,u6548,DREW,So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
147530,m435,meet joe black,L376439,u6552,PARRISH,I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.

147535,m435,meet joe black,L376433,u6552,PARRISH,I don't think so.  Do you?
147536,m435,meet joe black,L376432,u6548,DREW,Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something Bill?
147537,m435,meet joe black,L376388,u6548,DREW,Certainly.  Goodnight.
147538,m435,meet joe black,L376387,u6552,PARRISH,I think it's time you went home Drew.
147539,m435,meet joe black,L376386,u6548,DREW,I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
147540,m435,meet joe black,L376385,u6552,PARRISH,I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
147541,m435,meet joe black,L376384,u6548,DREW,Yours.
147542,m435,meet joe black,L376383,u6552,PARRISH,Whose?

147544,m435,meet joe black,L376381,u6552,PARRISH,I don't care.
147545,m435,meet joe black,L376380,u6548,DREW,What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
147546,m435,meet joe black,L376379,u6552,PARRISH,Over my dead body.
147547,m435,meet joe black,L376378,u6548,DREW,If I read this Board right now they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
147548,m435,meet joe black,L376377,u6552,PARRISH,What are their feelings?
147549,m435,meet joe black,L376376,u6548,DREW,Yes you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
147550,m435,meet joe black,L376375,u6552,PARRISH,What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't they know now.
147551,m435,meet joe black,L376279,u6548,DREW,Sure.
147552,m435,meet joe black,L376278,u6552,PARRISH,Okay we'll see you tomorrow.

147556,m435,meet joe black,L376226,u6552,PARRISH,Please.  Don't worry about him.  And above all don't antagonize him.
147557,m435,meet joe black,L376225,u6548,DREW,For how long?  And why?
147558,m435,meet joe black,L376224,u6552,PARRISH,You're competitive soul Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
147559,m435,meet joe black,L376223,u6548,DREW,As much as Joe's?
147560,m435,meet joe black,L376222,u6552,PARRISH,I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
147561,m435,meet joe black,L376167,u6552,PARRISH,Well now it's undone okay?  Forget Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it.
147562,m435,meet joe black,L376166,u6548,DREW,I thought this was practically a done deal --
147563,m435,meet joe black,L376165,u6552,PARRISH,Joe cut it out.  And you too Drew.
147564,m435,meet joe black,L376163,u6548,DREW,I was hired you told me to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
147565,m435,meet joe black,L376162,u6552,PARRISH,Why?
147566,m435,meet joe black,L376161,u6548,DREW,How nice for you both.
147567,m435,meet joe black,L376160,u6552,PARRISH,Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
147568,m435,meet joe black,L376159,u6548,DREW,Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone Bill.
147569,m435,meet joe black,L376158,u6552,PARRISH,Sit down Drew.
147570,m435,meet joe black,L376157,u6548,DREW,'Just kidding'?
147571,m435,meet joe black,L376156,u6552,PARRISH,No.

147576,m435,meet joe black,L376045,u6548,DREW,That's your privilege Bill.  But given our needs given the absolute necessity for growth given the fu- ture the truth is... joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as - Death and Taxes.
147577,m435,meet joe black,L376044,u6552,PARRISH,Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
147578,m435,meet joe black,L376043,u6548,DREW,...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
147579,m435,meet joe black,L375854,u6548,DREW,I get the feeling you've done some business before.

147625,m435,meet joe black,L376469,u6548,DREW,Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.

I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him he smacks it out of the park.
147628,m435,meet joe black,L376466,u6553,QUINCE,But I didn't mean to do it!
147629,m435,meet joe black,L376465,u6548,DREW,Quince you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.

147835,m435,meet joe black,L376306,u6555,SUSAN,Girlfriend?
147836,m435,meet joe black,L376305,u6551,JOE,No I'm not.
147837,m435,meet joe black,L376304,u6555,SUSAN,Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
147838,m435,meet joe black,L376303,u6551,JOE,Why?
147839,m435,meet joe black,L376301,u6551,JOE,I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
147840,m435,meet joe black,L376300,u6555,SUSAN,How long have you been standing there?
147841,m435,meet joe black,L376264,u6551,JOE,I'm sorry to hear that.
147842,m435,meet joe black,L376263,u6555,SUSAN,We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
147843,m435,meet joe black,L376262,u6551,JOE,Has her pain abated?
147844,m435,meet joe black,L376261,u6555,SUSAN,I am too.
147845,m435,meet joe black,L376260,u6551,JOE,I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
147846,m435,meet joe black,L376257,u6551,JOE,Yes...I've found that it does.
147847,m435,meet joe black,L376256,u6555,SUSAN,It comforts you doesn't it?
147848,m435,meet joe black,L376255,u6551,JOE,Yes...
147849,m435,meet joe black,L376254,u6555,SUSAN,I adore things like that....food I can't do without.  Don't you?
147850,m435,meet joe black,L376253,u6551,JOE,I don't know.
147851,m435,meet joe black,L376252,u6555,SUSAN,Why do you love peanut butter so much?
147852,m435,meet joe black,L376220,u6555,SUSAN,And I appreciate you too.

147856,m435,meet joe black,L376216,u6555,SUSAN,It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was it turned out to be welcome.
147857,m435,meet joe black,L376215,u6551,JOE,Well now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
147858,m435,meet joe black,L376214,u6555,SUSAN,I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
147859,m435,meet joe black,L376213,u6551,JOE,I wanted to apologize Susan --
147860,m435,meet joe black,L376137,u6551,JOE,Be sorry for nothing.
147861,m435,meet joe black,L376136,u6555,SUSAN,I have to go I'm sorry to say --
147862,m435,meet joe black,L376135,u6551,JOE,Not now.
147863,m435,meet joe black,L376134,u6555,SUSAN,Joe I'm with Drew.

147866,m435,meet joe black,L376093,u6551,JOE,I don't mind --
147867,m435,meet joe black,L376092,u6555,SUSAN,Patients have visitors not doctors.
147868,m435,meet joe black,L376091,u6551,JOE,And I'll be a visitor.
147869,m435,meet joe black,L376090,u6555,SUSAN,That's impossible.  I'm a doctor I'm --
147870,m435,meet joe black,L376089,u6551,JOE,Whatever you do.
147871,m435,meet joe black,L376088,u6555,SUSAN,Watch me do what?
147872,m435,meet joe black,L376087,u6551,JOE,Very well I'll watch.
147873,m435,meet joe black,L376086,u6555,SUSAN,I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
147874,m435,meet joe black,L376085,u6551,JOE,I came to see you.
147875,m435,meet joe black,L376084,u6555,SUSAN,Then why are you here Joe?
147876,m435,meet joe black,L376083,u6551,JOE,Oh goodness no.
147877,m435,meet joe black,L376081,u6551,JOE,How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
147878,m435,meet joe black,L376080,u6555,SUSAN,Joe --
147879,m435,meet joe black,L375972,u6555,SUSAN,I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
147880,m435,meet joe black,L375971,u6551,JOE,Yes?
147881,m435,meet joe black,L375969,u6551,JOE,Goodnight to you Susan.

147883,m435,meet joe black,L375967,u6551,JOE,Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
147884,m435,meet joe black,L375966,u6555,SUSAN,Yes?
147885,m435,meet joe black,L375965,u6551,JOE,Susan?
147886,m435,meet joe black,L375964,u6555,SUSAN,I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.
147887,m435,meet joe black,L375963,u6551,JOE,I have a certain function to per- form and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
147888,m435,meet joe black,L375962,u6555,SUSAN,Yes --?
147889,m435,meet joe black,L375960,u6555,SUSAN,I can see why.
147890,m435,meet joe black,L375959,u6551,JOE,I don't have any.
147891,m435,meet joe black,L375958,u6555,SUSAN,I've got plenty of friends.
147892,m435,meet joe black,L375957,u6551,JOE,I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
147893,m435,meet joe black,L375956,u6555,SUSAN,No Joe I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
147894,m435,meet joe black,L375955,u6551,JOE,I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
147895,m435,meet joe black,L375954,u6555,SUSAN,Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
147896,m435,meet joe black,L375953,u6551,JOE,When you put your mouth to his Susan it seems a frequent thing.
147897,m435,meet joe black,L375952,u6555,SUSAN,Come again?
147898,m435,meet joe black,L375951,u6551,JOE,Do you love Drew?
147899,m435,meet joe black,L375950,u6555,SUSAN,-- What kind of childhood did you have?
147900,m435,meet joe black,L375949,u6551,JOE,I haven't.
147901,m435,meet joe black,L375948,u6555,SUSAN,You act like you never had peanut butter before --
147902,m435,meet joe black,L375947,u6551,JOE,Peanut butter.
147903,m435,meet joe black,L375946,u6555,SUSAN,What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops turn a woman's head and I don't mind admitting it was turned I liked it but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You my father here in this house the cof- fee shop it's making me upset and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
147904,m435,meet joe black,L375945,u6551,JOE,That is not my intention.
147905,m435,meet joe black,L375944,u6555,SUSAN,Not the one I met this morning hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter you act like a stranger.
147906,m435,meet joe black,L375943,u6551,JOE,I am Joe.
147907,m435,meet joe black,L375942,u6555,SUSAN,You appear at his side out-of-the- blue stay at his house eat dinner with his family it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
147908,m435,meet joe black,L375941,u6551,JOE,'Big'?
147909,m435,meet joe black,L375939,u6551,JOE,I'm sorry.
147910,m435,meet joe black,L375938,u6555,SUSAN,-- Can't seem to escape you today.
147911,m435,meet joe black,L375937,u6551,JOE,I'm lost.
147912,m435,meet joe black,L375936,u6555,SUSAN,What are you doing here?
147913,m435,meet joe black,L376834,u6552,PARRISH,That's life.  What can I tell you?

147915,m435,meet joe black,L376829,u6551,JOE,Yes.
147916,m435,meet joe black,L376828,u6552,PARRISH,I guess you have your reasons.
147917,m435,meet joe black,L376827,u6551,JOE,Not exactly.
147918,m435,meet joe black,L376826,u6552,PARRISH,Thank you.
147919,m435,meet joe black,L376825,u6551,JOE,Happy Birthday Bill.
147920,m435,meet joe black,L376782,u6551,JOE,An indictable offense.
147921,m435,meet joe black,L376781,u6552,PARRISH,An offense --
147922,m435,meet joe black,L376780,u6551,JOE,Undisclosed conflict of interest --
147923,m435,meet joe black,L376779,u6552,PARRISH,Moreover Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately that's known as a conflict of interest --
147924,m435,meet joe black,L376778,u6551,JOE,And we're very grateful.
147925,m435,meet joe black,L376777,u6552,PARRISH,The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou on past deals had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
147926,m435,meet joe black,L376775,u6552,PARRISH,-- An IRS man.
147927,m435,meet joe black,L376774,u6551,JOE,I'll take it from here --  I am --
147928,m435,meet joe black,L376773,u6552,PARRISH,He is --
147929,m435,meet joe black,L376772,u6551,JOE,Prepare yourself Drew - I am --
147930,m435,meet joe black,L376771,u6552,PARRISH,I told you to shut up.
147931,m435,meet joe black,L376767,u6552,PARRISH,It's not necessary Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
147932,m435,meet joe black,L376766,u6551,JOE,It's time to put this person where he belongs.
147933,m435,meet joe black,L376765,u6552,PARRISH,Joe don't do this --
147934,m435,meet joe black,L376746,u6552,PARRISH,Get him in here.
147935,m435,meet joe black,L376745,u6551,JOE,Okay.
147936,m435,meet joe black,L376715,u6552,PARRISH,I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born and I love her now and every minute in between and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her who is worthy of her who is of this world of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
147937,m435,meet joe black,L376714,u6551,JOE,Are you threatening me?
147938,m435,meet joe black,L376713,u6552,PARRISH,I don't expect you to.
147939,m435,meet joe black,L376712,u6551,JOE,I don't like what you're saying.
147940,m435,meet joe black,L376711,u6552,PARRISH,Does she know where she's going?
147941,m435,meet joe black,L376710,u6551,JOE,No.
147942,m435,meet joe black,L376709,u6552,PARRISH,With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
147943,m435,meet joe black,L376708,u6551,JOE,Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
147944,m435,meet joe black,L376707,u6552,PARRISH,Well they're mine now.
147945,m435,meet joe black,L376706,u6551,JOE,Those were my words Bill.
147946,m435,meet joe black,L376705,u6552,PARRISH,Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
147947,m435,meet joe black,L376704,u6551,JOE,So that's what love is?
147948,m435,meet joe black,L376703,u6552,PARRISH,Trust responsibility taking the weight for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all not hurting the object of your love.
147949,m435,meet joe black,L376702,u6551,JOE,Which is what?
147950,m435,meet joe black,L376701,u6552,PARRISH,Some aimless infatuation in which for the moment you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
147951,m435,meet joe black,L376700,u6551,JOE,Then what is it?
147952,m435,meet joe black,L376699,u6552,PARRISH,How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
147953,m435,meet joe black,L376698,u6551,JOE,I love her Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before if you can understand.
147954,m435,meet joe black,L376697,u6552,PARRISH,Susan is my daughter she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well I'm sorry apology not accepted.
147955,m435,meet joe black,L376696,u6551,JOE,I'm sorry Bill --
147956,m435,meet joe black,L376695,u6552,PARRISH,You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
147957,m435,meet joe black,L376694,u6551,JOE,I think you heard me Bill.
147958,m435,meet joe black,L376693,u6552,PARRISH,You're what?
147959,m435,meet joe black,L376692,u6551,JOE,I'm in love with your daughter and I'm taking her with me tonight.
147960,m435,meet joe black,L376691,u6552,PARRISH,Say again?
147961,m435,meet joe black,L376690,u6551,JOE,-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
147962,m435,meet joe black,L376689,u6552,PARRISH,You 'want to know' I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death he's galloping into it.  And the same time the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.  And oh yes I almost forgot my daughter's fallen in love with Death.
147963,m435,meet joe black,L376688,u6551,JOE,I was just asking Bill.
147964,m435,meet joe black,L376687,u6552,PARRISH,What the hell do you care?
147965,m435,meet joe black,L376686,u6551,JOE,Not at all.
147966,m435,meet joe black,L376685,u6552,PARRISH,Thanks.
147967,m435,meet joe black,L376588,u6551,JOE,Good.  Tomorrow after the party.
147968,m435,meet joe black,L376587,u6552,PARRISH,Yeah.
147969,m435,meet joe black,L376586,u6551,JOE,You are?
147970,m435,meet joe black,L376585,u6552,PARRISH,What are you saying that it's time to go?
147971,m435,meet joe black,L376584,u6551,JOE,-- I have the feeling that all in all what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
147972,m435,meet joe black,L376583,u6552,PARRISH,Yes?
147973,m435,meet joe black,L376582,u6551,JOE,Uh --
147974,m435,meet joe black,L376525,u6551,JOE,I told you 'watch it'.
147975,m435,meet joe black,L376524,u6552,PARRISH,Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
147976,m435,meet joe black,L376523,u6551,JOE,May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
147977,m435,meet joe black,L376522,u6552,PARRISH,And I don't give a shit.
147978,m435,meet joe black,L376521,u6551,JOE,I don't like your tone and I don't like your references.
147979,m435,meet joe black,L376520,u6552,PARRISH,Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
147980,m435,meet joe black,L376519,u6551,JOE,This universe?
147981,m435,meet joe black,L376518,u6552,PARRISH,You're violating the laws of the universe.
147982,m435,meet joe black,L376515,u6551,JOE,I picked you for your verve your excellence and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct.  You've lived a first-rate life.  And I find it eminently usable.
147983,m435,meet joe black,L376514,u6552,PARRISH,Yes and stop repeating everything I say and turning it into a question. Spooning fooling around God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me I still don't under- stand --
147984,m435,meet joe black,L376513,u6551,JOE,'Spooning'?
147985,m435,meet joe black,L376512,u6552,PARRISH,Well you goddam well should.  You walk into my life give me the worst news a guy can get have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family and now you're spooning with my daughter.
147986,m435,meet joe black,L376511,u6551,JOE,With all due respect Bill I'm not asking your permission.
147987,m435,meet joe black,L376510,u6552,PARRISH,I'm her father!
147988,m435,meet joe black,L376509,u6551,JOE,I'll be the judge of that.
147989,m435,meet joe black,L376508,u6552,PARRISH,Well you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
147990,m435,meet joe black,L376507,u6551,JOE,Yes I saw you see me.
147991,m435,meet joe black,L376505,u6551,JOE,I'm sorry to hear that.
147992,m435,meet joe black,L376504,u6552,PARRISH,I couldn't sleep.
147993,m435,meet joe black,L376478,u6552,PARRISH,Then I can't help you.
147994,m435,meet joe black,L376477,u6551,JOE,I'm not hungry.
147995,m435,meet joe black,L376476,u6552,PARRISH,Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going to take a nap.
147996,m435,meet joe black,L376475,u6551,JOE,'Fish'?
147997,m435,meet joe black,L376474,u6552,PARRISH,What 'okay' is it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry don't we Joe?
147998,m435,meet joe black,L376473,u6552,PARRISH,Just a manner of speaking.
147999,m435,meet joe black,L376472,u6551,JOE,What's okay?
148000,m435,meet joe black,L376471,u6552,PARRISH,That's okay.
148001,m435,meet joe black,L376470,u6551,JOE,I'm sorry Bill --
148002,m435,meet joe black,L376425,u6551,JOE,Goodnight.
148003,m435,meet joe black,L376424,u6552,PARRISH,Okay.  Goodnight.
148004,m435,meet joe black,L376423,u6551,JOE,Um -- not right now.
148005,m435,meet joe black,L376422,u6552,PARRISH,Hello.  Would you like to join me Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
148006,m435,meet joe black,L376421,u6551,JOE,Hello Bill.
148007,m435,meet joe black,L376289,u6551,JOE,Are you going to fire me Bill?
148008,m435,meet joe black,L376288,u6552,PARRISH,How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me I fire.
148009,m435,meet joe black,L376287,u6551,JOE,You tell me Bill.
148010,m435,meet joe black,L376286,u6552,PARRISH,What way would you put it?
148011,m435,meet joe black,L376285,u6551,JOE,I wouldn't put it that way.
148012,m435,meet joe black,L376284,u6552,PARRISH,About Susan?
148013,m435,meet joe black,L376283,u6551,JOE,I guess...
148014,m435,meet joe black,L376282,u6552,PARRISH,You were just curious?
148015,m435,meet joe black,L376281,u6551,JOE,I don't know.
148016,m435,meet joe black,L376280,u6552,PARRISH,Why did you go to the hospital?
148017,m435,meet joe black,L376176,u6551,JOE,Easy Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
148018,m435,meet joe black,L376175,u6552,PARRISH,And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
148019,m435,meet joe black,L376174,u6551,JOE,Okay.
148020,m435,meet joe black,L376173,u6552,PARRISH,I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor of dedication of truth. Okay?
148021,m435,meet joe black,L376172,u6551,JOE,Why at this juncture are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
148022,m435,meet joe black,L376170,u6551,JOE,Absolutely.
148023,m435,meet joe black,L376169,u6552,PARRISH,Dinner?  Absolutely.
148024,m435,meet joe black,L376152,u6551,JOE,This part I'm interested in.
148025,m435,meet joe black,L376151,u6552,PARRISH,I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
148026,m435,meet joe black,L376150,u6551,JOE,Well...I don't know.
148027,m435,meet joe black,L376149,u6552,PARRISH,Why didn't you stop me?
148028,m435,meet joe black,L376148,u6551,JOE,And more.
148029,m435,meet joe black,L376147,u6552,PARRISH,Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
148030,m435,meet joe black,L376146,u6551,JOE,Uh-huh.
148031,m435,meet joe black,L376145,u6552,PARRISH,Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
148032,m435,meet joe black,L376144,u6551,JOE,Truly - uh - splendid.
148033,m435,meet joe black,L376143,u6552,PARRISH,Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
148034,m435,meet joe black,L376142,u6551,JOE,Excellent.  What is it?
148035,m435,meet joe black,L376141,u6552,PARRISH,It's all yours.
148036,m435,meet joe black,L376140,u6551,JOE,Are you going to eat your lunch
148037,m435,meet joe black,L376079,u6551,JOE,No thank you Bill.  I can manage.
148038,m435,meet joe black,L376078,u6552,PARRISH,Jennifer give Mr. Black a map of the city.
148039,m435,meet joe black,L376075,u6551,JOE,Oh.  Okay.
148040,m435,meet joe black,L376074,u6552,PARRISH,Now I'd like to be alone.
148041,m435,meet joe black,L376073,u6551,JOE,Of course.
148042,m435,meet joe black,L376072,u6552,PARRISH,Joe could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
148043,m435,meet joe black,L376071,u6551,JOE,You're not thinking of going some- where are you Bill?
148044,m435,meet joe black,L376070,u6552,PARRISH,Yes I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
148045,m435,meet joe black,L376069,u6551,JOE,Are you sad Bill?
148046,m435,meet joe black,L376068,u6552,PARRISH,...I'd like to be alone for a while.
148047,m435,meet joe black,L376067,u6551,JOE,I don't understand.
148048,m435,meet joe black,L376066,u6552,PARRISH,-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
148049,m435,meet joe black,L376040,u6551,JOE,Yes.
148050,m435,meet joe black,L376039,u6552,PARRISH,Would you like to sit down Joe?
148051,m435,meet joe black,L376028,u6551,JOE,I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
148052,m435,meet joe black,L376027,u6552,PARRISH,What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
148053,m435,meet joe black,L376026,u6551,JOE,No.
148054,m435,meet joe black,L376025,u6552,PARRISH,Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
148055,m435,meet joe black,L376016,u6551,JOE,So can I.
148056,m435,meet joe black,L376015,u6552,PARRISH,Yes.
148057,m435,meet joe black,L376014,u6551,JOE,Can you keep a secret?
148058,m435,meet joe black,L376013,u6552,PARRISH,What's it like where I'm going?
148059,m435,meet joe black,L376012,u6551,JOE,What do you mean?
148060,m435,meet joe black,L376011,u6552,PARRISH,What's it like?
148061,m435,meet joe black,L376010,u6551,JOE,I understand.
148062,m435,meet joe black,L376009,u6552,PARRISH,I want to live.
148063,m435,meet joe black,L376008,u6551,JOE,That's what everybody says.
148064,m435,meet joe black,L376007,u6552,PARRISH,I'm not everybody.
148065,m435,meet joe black,L376006,u6551,JOE,That's what everybody says.
148066,m435,meet joe black,L376005,u6552,PARRISH,-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young this is not my time --
148067,m435,meet joe black,L376004,u6551,JOE,Not this.
148068,m435,meet joe black,L376003,u6552,PARRISH,There's one to every rule.
148069,m435,meet joe black,L376002,u6551,JOE,Make an exception?
148070,m435,meet joe black,L376001,u6552,PARRISH,How about giving a guy a break?
148071,m435,meet joe black,L376000,u6551,JOE,Yes Bill.
148072,m435,meet joe black,L375999,u6552,PARRISH,Joe --?
148073,m435,meet joe black,L375998,u6551,JOE,So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
148074,m435,meet joe black,L375997,u6552,PARRISH,Of course.
148075,m435,meet joe black,L375996,u6551,JOE,So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here your work what your task is is being executed elsewhere.
148076,m435,meet joe black,L375995,u6552,PARRISH,I guess so.
148077,m435,meet joe black,L375994,u6551,JOE,You were hatching ideas making plans arriving at decisions right?
148078,m435,meet joe black,L375993,u6552,PARRISH,What do you mean?
148079,m435,meet joe black,L375992,u6551,JOE,When you were shaving this morning you weren't just shaving right?
148080,m435,meet joe black,L375989,u6551,JOE,You've got a deal.
148081,m435,meet joe black,L375988,u6552,PARRISH,Yes?
148082,m435,meet joe black,L375987,u6551,JOE,Bill --
148083,m435,meet joe black,L375986,u6552,PARRISH,You give your word I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
148084,m435,meet joe black,L375985,u6551,JOE,A 'deal'?
148085,m435,meet joe black,L375984,u6552,PARRISH,It is a deal?
148086,m435,meet joe black,L375983,u6551,JOE,Sounds fair enough.
148087,m435,meet joe black,L375982,u6552,PARRISH,And I won't tell anyone who you are.
148088,m435,meet joe black,L375981,u6551,JOE,And what?
148089,m435,meet joe black,L375979,u6551,JOE,Oh I wouldn't tell them anything Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting but I am cer- tain should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
148090,m435,meet joe black,L375978,u6552,PARRISH,Um -- well I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
148091,m435,meet joe black,L375977,u6551,JOE,'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
148092,m435,meet joe black,L375976,u6552,PARRISH,How are you?  How're you feeling?
148093,m435,meet joe black,L375975,u6551,JOE,Good morning Bill.
148094,m435,meet joe black,L375974,u6552,PARRISH,Good morning.
148095,m435,meet joe black,L375922,u6551,JOE,Good night to you Bill.
148096,m435,meet joe black,L375921,u6552,PARRISH,And - uh - I  guess 'goodnight'.
148097,m435,meet joe black,L375920,u6551,JOE,Not at all.
148098,m435,meet joe black,L375919,u6552,PARRISH,Well thank you for letting me know.
148099,m435,meet joe black,L375918,u6552,PARRISH,Closer than that.
148100,m435,meet joe black,L375917,u6551,JOE,I hope you realize Bill...in your office this morning that was your time.
148101,m435,meet joe black,L375916,u6552,PARRISH,No --
148102,m435,meet joe black,L375915,u6551,JOE,Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
148103,m435,meet joe black,L375914,u6552,PARRISH,...I just saw my doctor he told me everything was fine.
148104,m435,meet joe black,L375913,u6551,JOE,That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute I find myself lingering.
148105,m435,meet joe black,L375912,u6552,PARRISH,When you go I go.
148106,m435,meet joe black,L375911,u6551,JOE,You're putting me on the spot Bill.
148107,m435,meet joe black,L375910,u6552,PARRISH,How long have I got?
148108,m435,meet joe black,L375909,u6551,JOE,I won't.
148109,m435,meet joe black,L375908,u6552,PARRISH,If there is anything else don't hesitate --
148110,m435,meet joe black,L375907,u6551,JOE,No.
148111,m435,meet joe black,L375906,u6552,PARRISH,Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
148112,m435,meet joe black,L375905,u6551,JOE,What a good idea.
148113,m435,meet joe black,L375902,u6551,JOE,It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides isn't this what I'm here for?
148114,m435,meet joe black,L375901,u6552,PARRISH,I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
148115,m435,meet joe black,L375900,u6551,JOE,No.
148116,m435,meet joe black,L375899,u6552,PARRISH,So there's nothing between you and Susan?
148117,m435,meet joe black,L375898,u6551,JOE,I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
148118,m435,meet joe black,L375897,u6552,PARRISH,Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
148119,m435,meet joe black,L375896,u6551,JOE,'Threw' you?  Where?
148120,m435,meet joe black,L375895,u6552,PARRISH,...I'm sorry I'm a little discon- certed that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
148121,m435,meet joe black,L375891,u6551,JOE,Thank you.
148122,m435,meet joe black,L375890,u6552,PARRISH,Joe that's the kitchen.
148123,m435,meet joe black,L375847,u6552,PARRISH,Joe knows what you're saying just being polite --
148124,m435,meet joe black,L375846,u6551,JOE,No --
148126,m435,meet joe black,L375810,u6552,PARRISH,When I introduce you if I say who you are I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
148128,m435,meet joe black,L375808,u6552,PARRISH,It just occurred to me --
148130,m435,meet joe black,L375806,u6552,PARRISH,Excuse me?  Could I say something?
148132,m435,meet joe black,L375804,u6552,PARRISH,This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
148133,m435,meet joe black,L375801,u6552,PARRISH,And then --?
148135,m435,meet joe black,L375799,u6552,PARRISH,I do?  How long will you be staying?
148137,m435,meet joe black,L375797,u6552,PARRISH,You want me to be your guide --?
148139,m435,meet joe black,L375795,u6552,PARRISH,You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
148141,m435,meet joe black,L375793,u6552,PARRISH,Death!
148144,m435,meet joe black,L375789,u6552,PARRISH,You are --?
148145,m435,meet joe black,L375788,u6552,PARRISH,You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you?
148147,m435,meet joe black,L375786,u6552,PARRISH,Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
148149,m435,meet joe black,L375782,u6552,PARRISH,The 'question' --
148151,m435,meet joe black,L375780,u6552,PARRISH,What question?
148153,m435,meet joe black,L375778,u6552,PARRISH,Yes what?
148155,m435,meet joe black,L375776,u6552,PARRISH,I'm sorry --
148157,m435,meet joe black,L375774,u6552,PARRISH,What the hell are you talking about?
148159,m435,meet joe black,L375772,u6552,PARRISH,Get what?
148161,m435,meet joe black,L375770,u6552,PARRISH,'The one' to do what?
148163,m435,meet joe black,L375768,u6552,PARRISH,'Take me'...?  Where?
148165,m435,meet joe black,L375766,u6552,PARRISH,About what?
148167,m435,meet joe black,L375764,u6552,PARRISH,What the hell is this?  Who are you?
148170,m435,meet joe black,L375760,u6552,PARRISH,What is this a joke right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
148172,m435,meet joe black,L375758,u6552,PARRISH,Where are you?
148173,m435,meet joe black,L375701,u6552,PARRISH,Know what?  Know what goddammit!
148175,m435,meet joe black,L375699,u6552,PARRISH,What do you mean?!
148177,m435,meet joe black,L375697,u6552,PARRISH,Please.  Talk to me --
148179,m435,meet joe black,L375695,u6552,PARRISH,Where are you?  Are you there?
148181,m435,meet joe black,L375693,u6552,PARRISH,I'm sorry I --
148184,m435,meet joe black,L375689,u6552,PARRISH,What are you talking about?
148186,m435,meet joe black,L375687,u6552,PARRISH,I don't!
148189,m435,meet joe black,L375683,u6552,PARRISH,I didn't ask any question.
148191,m435,meet joe black,L375681,u6552,PARRISH,'Yes' what?
148192,m435,meet joe black,L375611,u6552,PARRISH,What?
148194,m435,meet joe black,L376684,u6553,QUINCE,Sir I'll deliver the package.
148195,m435,meet joe black,L376683,u6552,PARRISH,Quince I've got confidence in you.
148196,m435,meet joe black,L376682,u6553,QUINCE,You think Drew will go for it?
148197,m435,meet joe black,L376681,u6552,PARRISH,All in all what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
148198,m435,meet joe black,L376676,u6552,PARRISH,Yes I believe I do.
148199,m435,meet joe black,L376675,u6553,QUINCE,Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls you know what I mean?
148200,m435,meet joe black,L376674,u6552,PARRISH,Sure.
148201,m435,meet joe black,L376673,u6553,QUINCE,Come in Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay Bill?
148202,m435,meet joe black,L376671,u6552,PARRISH,It's okay Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
148203,m435,meet joe black,L376670,u6553,QUINCE,...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged I opened my big mouth one too many times everything got all twisted --

148259,m435,meet joe black,L376802,u6552,PARRISH,I'm sorry.
148260,m435,meet joe black,L376801,u6555,SUSAN,You were right about Joe he is going somewhere --
148261,m435,meet joe black,L376800,u6552,PARRISH,I'm having a helluva time.
148262,m435,meet joe black,L376799,u6555,SUSAN,What a night.
148263,m435,meet joe black,L376574,u6552,PARRISH,I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
148264,m435,meet joe black,L376573,u6555,SUSAN,I love him.
148265,m435,meet joe black,L376572,u6552,PARRISH,In this case I can't.  I - uh -- I just can't help you.  I only would tell you -- that with Joe you are on very very dangerous ground.
148266,m435,meet joe black,L376571,u6555,SUSAN,C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
148267,m435,meet joe black,L376570,u6552,PARRISH,I don't know I can't say --
148268,m435,meet joe black,L376569,u6555,SUSAN,Where's he going?
148269,m435,meet joe black,L376568,u6552,PARRISH,Susan I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
148270,m435,meet joe black,L376567,u6555,SUSAN,What are you afraid of Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard whether you like or not.
148271,m435,meet joe black,L376566,u6552,PARRISH,You don't know anything about Joe --
148272,m435,meet joe black,L376565,u6555,SUSAN,Why?  A man appears at your side almost never leaves it you clearly trust him depend on him I sense you value him deeply why aren't those things good enough for me?
148273,m435,meet joe black,L376564,u6552,PARRISH,This is crazy --
148274,m435,meet joe black,L376563,u6555,SUSAN,Love.  Passion.  Obsession all those things you told me to wait for.  Well they've arrived.
148275,m435,meet joe black,L376562,u6552,PARRISH,I don't understand.
148276,m435,meet joe black,L376561,u6555,SUSAN,Because I was sitting in a staff meeting incredibly bored my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
148277,m435,meet joe black,L376560,u6552,PARRISH,I don't know.
148278,m435,meet joe black,L376559,u6555,SUSAN,Where is he?
148279,m435,meet joe black,L376558,u6552,PARRISH,Joe?
148280,m435,meet joe black,L376557,u6555,SUSAN,Where's Joe?
148281,m435,meet joe black,L376329,u6555,SUSAN,It's something.
148282,m435,meet joe black,L376328,u6552,PARRISH,Then what is it?
148283,m435,meet joe black,L376327,u6555,SUSAN,When you say 'nothing' that way it's not nothing.
148284,m435,meet joe black,L376326,u6552,PARRISH,Nothing.
148285,m435,meet joe black,L376325,u6555,SUSAN,Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
148286,m435,meet joe black,L376324,u6552,PARRISH,I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before but I've come to appreciate --
148287,m435,meet joe black,L376323,u6555,SUSAN,Then what will you say?
148288,m435,meet joe black,L376322,u6552,PARRISH,I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
148289,m435,meet joe black,L376320,u6552,PARRISH,What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
148290,m435,meet joe black,L376319,u6555,SUSAN,Raise away.
148291,m435,meet joe black,L376318,u6552,PARRISH,Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
148292,m435,meet joe black,L376317,u6555,SUSAN,Yeah it's good to get together.
148293,m435,meet joe black,L376316,u6552,PARRISH,That was wonderful.
148294,m435,meet joe black,L376239,u6552,PARRISH,Will it?...
148295,m435,meet joe black,L376238,u6555,SUSAN,It'll come back Daddy.
148296,m435,meet joe black,L375888,u6552,PARRISH,Cut it out Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow everybody.  Joe let's go.
148297,m435,meet joe black,L375887,u6555,SUSAN,Funny I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
148298,m435,meet joe black,L375877,u6555,SUSAN,Incidentally 'Joe' what?
148299,m435,meet joe black,L375876,u6552,PARRISH,Uh - will that hold you Joe?
148300,m435,meet joe black,L375866,u6555,SUSAN,-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.

148304,m435,meet joe black,L375625,u6552,PARRISH,Yer damn right.
148305,m435,meet joe black,L375624,u6555,SUSAN,Well go get 'em Pops.
148306,m435,meet joe black,L375623,u6552,PARRISH,A-Okay.  Got my gloves on my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
148307,m435,meet joe black,L375622,u6555,SUSAN,Are you okay?
148308,m435,meet joe black,L375620,u6552,PARRISH,Nothing.
148309,m435,meet joe black,L375619,u6555,SUSAN,What is it Daddy --?
148310,m435,meet joe black,L375617,u6552,PARRISH,Nothing.  I'm sorry.
148311,m435,meet joe black,L375616,u6555,SUSAN,Daddy what's the matter?
148312,m435,meet joe black,L375606,u6552,PARRISH,He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
148313,m435,meet joe black,L375605,u6555,SUSAN,Thank God.
148314,m435,meet joe black,L375604,u6552,PARRISH,I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
148315,m435,meet joe black,L375603,u6555,SUSAN,You're terrible.
148316,m435,meet joe black,L375602,u6552,PARRISH,You won't tell him and even if you did he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
148317,m435,meet joe black,L375601,u6555,SUSAN,I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it he won't either.
148318,m435,meet joe black,L375600,u6552,PARRISH,Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
148319,m435,meet joe black,L375599,u6555,SUSAN,I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
148320,m435,meet joe black,L375598,u6552,PARRISH,Aw you're tough.
148321,m435,meet joe black,L375597,u6555,SUSAN,Bravo.
148322,m435,meet joe black,L375596,u6552,PARRISH,I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion obsession someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk if you get hurt you'll come back.  Because the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried you haven't lived.
148323,m435,meet joe black,L375595,u6555,SUSAN,'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
148324,m435,meet joe black,L375594,u6552,PARRISH,Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
148325,m435,meet joe black,L375593,u6555,SUSAN,That's all?
148326,m435,meet joe black,L375592,u6552,PARRISH,Well it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
148327,m435,meet joe black,L375591,u6555,SUSAN,Don't get dirty Dad --
148328,m435,meet joe black,L375590,u6552,PARRISH,Oh yes I am.  Not an ounce of excitement not a whisper of a thrill this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
148329,m435,meet joe black,L375589,u6555,SUSAN,You're not listening --
148330,m435,meet joe black,L375588,u6552,PARRISH,That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew it's what you don't say.
148331,m435,meet joe black,L375587,u6555,SUSAN,So what's wrong with that?
148332,m435,meet joe black,L375586,u6552,PARRISH,Listen I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart he's aggressive he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
148333,m435,meet joe black,L375585,u6555,SUSAN,What were you going to say?
148334,m435,meet joe black,L375584,u6552,PARRISH,Well I wasn't going to say that --
148335,m435,meet joe black,L375583,u6555,SUSAN,And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
148336,m435,meet joe black,L375582,u6552,PARRISH,Susan you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career you're beautiful --
148337,m435,meet joe black,L375581,u6555,SUSAN,Uh oh --
148338,m435,meet joe black,L375580,u6552,PARRISH,Don't get carried away.
148339,m435,meet joe black,L375579,u6555,SUSAN,Probably.
148340,m435,meet joe black,L375578,u6552,PARRISH,Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
148341,m435,meet joe black,L375577,u6555,SUSAN,You mean like you loved Mom?
148342,m435,meet joe black,L375576,u6552,PARRISH,Do you love Drew?
148343,m435,meet joe black,L375574,u6552,PARRISH,I know it's none of my business --
148344,m435,meet joe black,L375573,u6555,SUSAN,...There's a start for a meeting.
148345,m435,meet joe black,L375572,u6552,PARRISH,I am.  With you.
148346,m435,meet joe black,L375571,u6555,SUSAN,I thought you were in a meeting--?
148347,m435,meet joe black,L375570,u6552,PARRISH,Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's get this day started.
148348,m435,meet joe black,L375569,u6555,SUSAN,You're only six-five once.
148349,m435,meet joe black,L375568,u6552,PARRISH,Not my birthday again?
148350,m435,meet joe black,L375538,u6555,SUSAN,...Then don't.
148351,m435,meet joe black,L375537,u6552,PARRISH,I don't like to interfere.
148352,m435,meet joe black,L375536,u6555,SUSAN,Yeah.  I guess so.
148353,m435,meet joe black,L375535,u6552,PARRISH,You like him don't you?
148354,m435,meet joe black,L375534,u6555,SUSAN,I hope so.
148355,m435,meet joe black,L375533,u6552,PARRISH,Does Drew tell you everything?
148356,m435,meet joe black,L375532,u6555,SUSAN,Drew told me.
148357,m435,meet joe black,L375531,u6552,PARRISH,How did you know?
148358,m435,meet joe black,L375530,u6555,SUSAN,Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
148359,m435,meet joe black,L375524,u6555,SUSAN,He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
148360,m435,meet joe black,L375523,u6552,PARRISH,Drew's aboard?
148361,m435,meet joe black,L375520,u6552,PARRISH,Hi honey.
148362,m435,meet joe black,L375519,u6555,SUSAN,Good morning Dad.
148364,m435,meet joe black,L376854,u6555,SUSAN,...We know so little about each other.
148366,m435,meet joe black,L376850,u6555,SUSAN,No --
148368,m435,meet joe black,L375723,u6555,SUSAN,Because I like you so much.  Now I've got to go.
148370,m435,meet joe black,L375721,u6555,SUSAN,Sure I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
148372,m435,meet joe black,L375719,u6555,SUSAN,Why?
148374,m435,meet joe black,L375717,u6555,SUSAN,No it was so right it scares me.
148376,m435,meet joe black,L375715,u6555,SUSAN,I've got to go --
148378,m435,meet joe black,L375713,u6555,SUSAN,You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
148380,m435,meet joe black,L375711,u6555,SUSAN,You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
148382,m435,meet joe black,L375709,u6555,SUSAN,'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
148385,m435,meet joe black,L375668,u6555,SUSAN,I've got patients coming in --
148387,m435,meet joe black,L375666,u6555,SUSAN,Not at all.

148934,m444,moonstruck,L391409,u6649,LORETTA,What are you doing here?
148935,m444,moonstruck,L391408,u6646,COSMO,What are you doing here?
148936,m444,moonstruck,L391407,u6649,LORETTA,I got it done.
148937,m444,moonstruck,L391406,u6646,COSMO,What'd you do to your hair?

148942,m444,moonstruck,L390947,u6649,LORETTA,It's temporary.
148943,m444,moonstruck,L390946,u6646,COSMO,It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
148944,m444,moonstruck,L390945,u6649,LORETTA,Here.
148945,m444,moonstruck,L390944,u6646,COSMO,That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
148946,m444,moonstruck,L390943,u6649,LORETTA,Yeah.
148947,m444,moonstruck,L390942,u6646,COSMO,He did?
148948,m444,moonstruck,L390941,u6649,LORETTA,I didn't have no wedding cake no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
148949,m444,moonstruck,L390940,u6646,COSMO,Maybe.
148950,m444,moonstruck,L390939,u6649,LORETTA,And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away and I got married in a church in a wedding dress instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
148951,m444,moonstruck,L390938,u6646,COSMO,I didn't give you away the first time.
148952,m444,moonstruck,L390937,u6649,LORETTA,You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
148953,m444,moonstruck,L390936,u6646,COSMO,I won't come.

148956,m444,moonstruck,L390933,u6649,LORETTA,He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
148957,m444,moonstruck,L390932,u6646,COSMO,Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
148958,m444,moonstruck,L390931,u6649,LORETTA,Johnny Cammareri.

148962,m444,moonstruck,L390927,u6649,LORETTA,The guy died.
148963,m444,moonstruck,L390926,u6646,COSMO,You did this once it didn't work out.
148964,m444,moonstruck,L390925,u6649,LORETTA,Yeah.
148965,m444,moonstruck,L390924,u6646,COSMO,Again?
148966,m444,moonstruck,L390923,u6649,LORETTA,I'm getting married.
148967,m444,moonstruck,L390922,u6646,COSMO,What's your news?
148968,m444,moonstruck,L390921,u6649,LORETTA,You look tired.

148979,m444,moonstruck,L391386,u6646,COSMO,I like your dress.  It's very bright.
148981,m444,moonstruck,L391076,u6646,COSMO,They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars I guess.
148983,m444,moonstruck,L391073,u6646,COSMO,I brought you something.
148985,m444,moonstruck,L391071,u6646,COSMO,The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap but the man saw that I was right.
148987,m444,moonstruck,L391069,u6646,COSMO,And then there is copper which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
149000,m444,moonstruck,L391649,u6649,LORETTA,Before all these people yes I will marry you Ronny Cammareri!
149001,m444,moonstruck,L391648,u6659,RONNY,Will you marry me Loretta Castorini Clark?

149005,m444,moonstruck,L391632,u6649,LORETTA,I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
149006,m444,moonstruck,L391631,u6659,RONNY,Loretta what are you talking about?
149007,m444,moonstruck,L391630,u6649,LORETTA,What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
149008,m444,moonstruck,L391583,u6649,LORETTA,No I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
149009,m444,moonstruck,L391582,u6659,RONNY,No I'll tell him.
149010,m444,moonstruck,L391562,u6649,LORETTA,Ronny please...
149011,m444,moonstruck,L391561,u6659,RONNY,No. I'm gonna wait.
149012,m444,moonstruck,L391560,u6649,LORETTA,You've gotta get outta here.
149013,m444,moonstruck,L391557,u6659,RONNY,Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny Johnny's brother. 
149014,m444,moonstruck,L391556,u6649,LORETTA,He's coming.
149015,m444,moonstruck,L391555,u6659,RONNY,Is Johnny here?
149016,m444,moonstruck,L391554,u6649,LORETTA,Ronny!
149017,m444,moonstruck,L391481,u6659,RONNY,Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No that's not what I mean. Loretta I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice it ruins everything it breaks your heart it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
149018,m444,moonstruck,L391480,u6649,LORETTA,I'm freezing to death.
149019,m444,moonstruck,L391479,u6659,RONNY,No.
149020,m444,moonstruck,L391478,u6649,LORETTA,Let me go home.
149021,m444,moonstruck,L391477,u6659,RONNY,No.
149022,m444,moonstruck,L391476,u6649,LORETTA,Let me go home.
149023,m444,moonstruck,L391475,u6659,RONNY,I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night like you told me but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
149024,m444,moonstruck,L391474,u6649,LORETTA,Why not?
149025,m444,moonstruck,L391473,u6649,LORETTA,And you're not now?
149026,m444,moonstruck,L391472,u6659,RONNY,I was.
149027,m444,moonstruck,L391471,u6649,LORETTA,I'm afraid of who I am.
149028,m444,moonstruck,L391470,u6659,RONNY,Why?
149029,m444,moonstruck,L391469,u6649,LORETTA,I'm really afraid.
149030,m444,moonstruck,L391468,u6659,RONNY,Yeah.
149031,m444,moonstruck,L391467,u6649,LORETTA,I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life and they can change how they do things and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?
149032,m444,moonstruck,L391466,u6649,LORETTA,The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
149033,m444,moonstruck,L391465,u6659,RONNY,Yeah.
149034,m444,moonstruck,L391464,u6649,LORETTA,This is where we're going!
149035,m444,moonstruck,L391463,u6659,RONNY,That's right.
149036,m444,moonstruck,L391462,u6649,LORETTA,This is your place.
149037,m444,moonstruck,L391461,u6659,RONNY,We're here.
149038,m444,moonstruck,L391460,u6649,LORETTA,You're late!
149039,m444,moonstruck,L391459,u6659,RONNY,I'm here!
149040,m444,moonstruck,L391458,u6649,LORETTA,He didn't come!
149041,m444,moonstruck,L391457,u6659,RONNY,And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time why didn't you wait for the right man again?
149042,m444,moonstruck,L391456,u6649,LORETTA,I know what I know.
149043,m444,moonstruck,L391455,u6659,RONNY,Of what? Only God can point the finger Loretta.
149044,m444,moonstruck,L391454,u6649,LORETTA,You are guilty. I'm guilty.
149045,m444,moonstruck,L391453,u6659,RONNY,You're making me feel guilty again.
149046,m444,moonstruck,L391452,u6649,LORETTA,How can you ask me that?
149047,m444,moonstruck,L391451,u6659,RONNY,What's the matter?
149048,m444,moonstruck,L391449,u6659,RONNY,Yeah. It smells like snow.
149049,m444,moonstruck,L391448,u6649,LORETTA,It's really cold.
149050,m444,moonstruck,L391447,u6649,LORETTA,I wanna go home.
149051,m444,moonstruck,L391446,u6659,RONNY,What do you want to do now?
149052,m444,moonstruck,L391445,u6659,RONNY,I think that's it.
149053,m444,moonstruck,L391444,u6649,LORETTA,No thanks.
149054,m444,moonstruck,L391398,u6649,LORETTA,I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
149055,m444,moonstruck,L391397,u6659,RONNY,Yeah.
149056,m444,moonstruck,L391396,u6649,LORETTA,Beautiful. Sad. She died!
149057,m444,moonstruck,L391395,u6659,RONNY,Awful?
149058,m444,moonstruck,L391394,u6649,LORETTA,That was just so... awful!
149059,m444,moonstruck,L391384,u6649,LORETTA,I like parts of it but I don't really get it.
149060,m444,moonstruck,L391383,u6659,RONNY,It's the best thing there is.
149061,m444,moonstruck,L391382,u6649,LORETTA,They get some turnout for this stuff.
149062,m444,moonstruck,L391329,u6659,RONNY,Come on.
149063,m444,moonstruck,L391328,u6649,LORETTA,So. Where are we sitting?
149064,m444,moonstruck,L391327,u6659,RONNY,I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.
149065,m444,moonstruck,L391326,u6649,LORETTA,For what?
149066,m444,moonstruck,L391325,u6659,RONNY,Thank you!
149067,m444,moonstruck,L391324,u6659,RONNY,He was having some fun. Yeah well he's dead.  Come on let's go in.
149068,m444,moonstruck,L391323,u6649,LORETTA,Kinda gaudy.
149069,m444,moonstruck,L391322,u6659,RONNY,Marc Chagall. A Russian.
149070,m444,moonstruck,L391321,u6649,LORETTA,Who painted that?
149071,m444,moonstruck,L391319,u6659,RONNY,Thank you.
149072,m444,moonstruck,L391318,u6649,LORETTA,I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
149073,m444,moonstruck,L391317,u6659,RONNY,You look beautiful. Your hair...
149074,m444,moonstruck,L391316,u6649,LORETTA,Hi.

149079,m444,moonstruck,L391229,u6659,RONNY,I love two things. I love you and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
149080,m444,moonstruck,L391228,u6649,LORETTA,What are you talking about?
149081,m444,moonstruck,L391227,u6659,RONNY,That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
149082,m444,moonstruck,L391226,u6649,LORETTA,What?
149083,m444,moonstruck,L391225,u6659,RONNY,Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
149084,m444,moonstruck,L391224,u6649,LORETTA,But that's cause he don't know!
149085,m444,moonstruck,L391223,u6659,RONNY,But he wants me to come!
149086,m444,moonstruck,L391222,u6649,LORETTA,I'm telling you you can't.
149087,m444,moonstruck,L391221,u6659,RONNY,I'll come to the wedding.
149088,m444,moonstruck,L391220,u6649,LORETTA,Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
149089,m444,moonstruck,L391219,u6659,RONNY,I can't!
149090,m444,moonstruck,L391218,u6649,LORETTA,Snap out of it!
149091,m444,moonstruck,L391217,u6659,RONNY,I'm in love with you!
149092,m444,moonstruck,L391216,u6649,LORETTA,Why not?
149093,m444,moonstruck,L391215,u6659,RONNY,I can't do that!
149094,m444,moonstruck,L391214,u6649,LORETTA,Last night never happened you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
149095,m444,moonstruck,L391213,u6659,RONNY,What?
149096,m444,moonstruck,L391212,u6649,LORETTA,Oh yes oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
149097,m444,moonstruck,L391211,u6659,RONNY,Oh no I didn't!
149098,m444,moonstruck,L391210,u6649,LORETTA,That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
149099,m444,moonstruck,L391209,u6659,RONNY,You ruined my life.
149100,m444,moonstruck,L391208,u6649,LORETTA,What did I do?
149101,m444,moonstruck,L391207,u6659,RONNY,What did you do?
149102,m444,moonstruck,L391206,u6649,LORETTA,You don't get along with anybody!
149103,m444,moonstruck,L391205,u6659,RONNY,She didn't like me.
149104,m444,moonstruck,L391204,u6649,LORETTA,You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
149105,m444,moonstruck,L391203,u6659,RONNY,All right I'm guilty. I confess!
149106,m444,moonstruck,L391202,u6649,LORETTA,I'm marrying your brother!
149107,m444,moonstruck,L391201,u6659,RONNY,You're trying to make me feel guilty.
149108,m444,moonstruck,L391200,u6649,LORETTA,I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
149109,m444,moonstruck,L391199,u6659,RONNY,Don't just become excited.
149110,m444,moonstruck,L391198,u6649,LORETTA,This time I was trying to do everything right.
149111,m444,moonstruck,L391197,u6659,RONNY,Take it easy.
149112,m444,moonstruck,L391196,u6649,LORETTA,What? What have we done?
149113,m444,moonstruck,L391195,u6659,RONNY,What?
149114,m444,moonstruck,L391194,u6649,LORETTA,Oh my God.
149115,m444,moonstruck,L391178,u6659,RONNY,It makes you look like an angel.
149116,m444,moonstruck,L391177,u6649,LORETTA,I've never seen a moon like that.
149117,m444,moonstruck,L391176,u6659,RONNY,It's so bright.
149118,m444,moonstruck,L391174,u6659,RONNY,I don't know. I think it's the moon.
149119,m444,moonstruck,L391173,u6649,LORETTA,That light.
149120,m444,moonstruck,L391172,u6659,RONNY,What?
149121,m444,moonstruck,L391147,u6659,RONNY,Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
149122,m444,moonstruck,L391146,u6649,LORETTA,You're mad at him take it out on me take your revenge on me! Take everything leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
149123,m444,moonstruck,L391145,u6659,RONNY,What about Johnny?
149124,m444,moonstruck,L391144,u6649,LORETTA,Get all of me. Take everything.
149125,m444,moonstruck,L391143,u6659,RONNY,I've got you.
149126,m444,moonstruck,L391142,u6649,LORETTA,I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
149127,m444,moonstruck,L391141,u6659,RONNY,Loretta.
149128,m444,moonstruck,L391140,u6649,LORETTA,All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
149129,m444,moonstruck,L391139,u6659,RONNY,Your blood.
149130,m444,moonstruck,L391138,u6649,LORETTA,I was dead too.
149131,m444,moonstruck,L391137,u6659,RONNY,I was dead.
149132,m444,moonstruck,L391136,u6649,LORETTA,Me neither.
149133,m444,moonstruck,L391135,u6659,RONNY,I can't believe what is happening.
149134,m444,moonstruck,L391134,u6649,LORETTA,Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
149135,m444,moonstruck,L391133,u6659,RONNY,To the bed.
149136,m444,moonstruck,L391132,u6649,LORETTA,Where are you taking me?
149137,m444,moonstruck,L391131,u6659,RONNY,Son of a bitch!
149138,m444,moonstruck,L391127,u6649,LORETTA,A wolf without a foot!
149139,m444,moonstruck,L391126,u6659,RONNY,A bride without a head!
149140,m444,moonstruck,L391125,u6649,LORETTA,I am looking where I should to become a bride!
149141,m444,moonstruck,L391124,u6659,RONNY,He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
149142,m444,moonstruck,L391123,u6649,LORETTA,Because I have no Luck!
149143,m444,moonstruck,L391122,u6659,RONNY,Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
149144,m444,moonstruck,L391121,u6649,LORETTA,No!
149145,m444,moonstruck,L391120,u6659,RONNY,Stop it!
149146,m444,moonstruck,L391119,u6649,LORETTA,I'm telling you your life!
149147,m444,moonstruck,L391118,u6659,RONNY,What are you doing!
149148,m444,moonstruck,L391117,u6649,LORETTA,The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do between you and you and I know I'm right I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
149149,m444,moonstruck,L391116,u6659,RONNY,I'm a wolf?
149150,m444,moonstruck,L391115,u6649,LORETTA,I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means but I see what the true story is and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
149151,m444,moonstruck,L391114,u6659,RONNY,You don't know nothing about it.
149152,m444,moonstruck,L391113,u6649,LORETTA,You really are stupid you know that.
149153,m444,moonstruck,L391112,u6659,RONNY,Yes.
149154,m444,moonstruck,L391111,u6649,LORETTA,You think so?
149155,m444,moonstruck,L391110,u6659,RONNY,She was right to leave me.
149156,m444,moonstruck,L391109,u6649,LORETTA,You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
149157,m444,moonstruck,L391108,u6659,RONNY,Why you talking to me?
149158,m444,moonstruck,L391107,u6649,LORETTA,What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
149159,m444,moonstruck,L391106,u6659,RONNY,I don't care about Luck you understand me? It ain't that.
149160,m444,moonstruck,L391105,u6649,LORETTA,No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
149161,m444,moonstruck,L391104,u6659,RONNY,Stupid yourself.
149162,m444,moonstruck,L391103,u6649,LORETTA,Just Johnny.
149163,m444,moonstruck,L391102,u6659,RONNY,How many men since then?
149164,m444,moonstruck,L391101,u6649,LORETTA,Seven years ago.
149165,m444,moonstruck,L391100,u6659,RONNY,When your husband get hit by the bus?
149166,m444,moonstruck,L391099,u6649,LORETTA,Stupid.
149167,m444,moonstruck,L391098,u6659,RONNY,No.
149168,m444,moonstruck,L391097,u6649,LORETTA,So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
149169,m444,moonstruck,L391096,u6659,RONNY,I don't know.
149170,m444,moonstruck,L391095,u6649,LORETTA,Why what?
149171,m444,moonstruck,L391094,u6659,RONNY,Why?
149172,m444,moonstruck,L391093,u6649,LORETTA,Yesterday.
149173,m444,moonstruck,L391092,u6659,RONNY,When you get engaged?
149174,m444,moonstruck,L391091,u6649,LORETTA,Instantaneous.
149175,m444,moonstruck,L391090,u6659,RONNY,Fast.
149176,m444,moonstruck,L391089,u6649,LORETTA,Bus hit him.
149177,m444,moonstruck,L391088,u6659,RONNY,How'd he die?
149178,m444,moonstruck,L391087,u6649,LORETTA,He knew my husband who died.
149179,m444,moonstruck,L391086,u6659,RONNY,Where'd Johnny find you?
149180,m444,moonstruck,L391085,u6649,LORETTA,Loretta.
149181,m444,moonstruck,L391084,u6659,RONNY,This is good. Uhh...
149182,m444,moonstruck,L391083,u6649,LORETTA,You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
149183,m444,moonstruck,L391082,u6659,RONNY,I like it well done.
149184,m444,moonstruck,L391081,u6649,LORETTA,I know that. I do what I want.
149185,m444,moonstruck,L391080,u6659,RONNY,You don't have to help me.
149186,m444,moonstruck,L391079,u6649,LORETTA,I'm making you a steak.
149187,m444,moonstruck,L391078,u6659,RONNY,Loretta. What's that smell?
149188,m444,moonstruck,L391062,u6659,RONNY,I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget?
149189,m444,moonstruck,L391061,u6649,LORETTA,But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
149190,m444,moonstruck,L391060,u6659,RONNY,That's it.
149191,m444,moonstruck,L391059,u6649,LORETTA,That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
149192,m444,moonstruck,L391058,u6659,RONNY,It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed she left me for another man.
149193,m444,moonstruck,L391053,u6659,RONNY,No I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy gimme the big knife!
149194,m444,moonstruck,L391052,u6649,LORETTA,Maybe I should come back another time.
149195,m444,moonstruck,L391051,u6659,RONNY,Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
149196,m444,moonstruck,L391046,u6649,LORETTA,I don't understand.
149197,m444,moonstruck,L391045,u6659,RONNY,I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
149198,m444,moonstruck,L391044,u6649,LORETTA,Excuse me.
149199,m444,moonstruck,L391043,u6659,RONNY,I have no life.
149200,m444,moonstruck,L391042,u6649,LORETTA,Yes. Do you want...
149201,m444,moonstruck,L391041,u6659,RONNY,You are going to marry my brother?
149202,m444,moonstruck,L391040,u6649,LORETTA,I'm going to marry him.
149203,m444,moonstruck,L391039,u6659,RONNY,Why?
149204,m444,moonstruck,L391038,u6649,LORETTA,Yes.
149205,m444,moonstruck,L391037,u6659,RONNY,Have you come from my brother?
149206,m444,moonstruck,L391027,u6649,LORETTA,Let me come and talk to you.
149207,m444,moonstruck,L391026,u6659,RONNY,What's wrong can never be made right. 
149208,m444,moonstruck,L391025,u6649,LORETTA,He's in Palermo.
149209,m444,moonstruck,L391024,u6659,RONNY,Why didn't he call himself?
149210,m444,moonstruck,L391023,u6649,LORETTA,I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
149211,m444,moonstruck,L391022,u6659,RONNY,Yeah this is Ronny.
149212,m444,moonstruck,L391610,u6649,LORETTA,Johnny.
149214,m444,moonstruck,L391591,u6649,LORETTA,You? No.
149216,m444,moonstruck,L391587,u6649,LORETTA,Hi.
149218,m444,moonstruck,L391309,u6649,LORETTA,Yeah I'll be in.
149220,m444,moonstruck,L391307,u6649,LORETTA,Bye Aunt Rita.
149221,m444,moonstruck,L391292,u6649,LORETTA,I got a lot on my mind Aunt Rita.
149223,m444,moonstruck,L391288,u6649,LORETTA,Right.
149225,m444,moonstruck,L391286,u6649,LORETTA,I got things to do.
149226,m444,moonstruck,L391645,u6649,LORETTA,Where's the ring?
149227,m444,moonstruck,L391644,u6652,MR. JOHNNY,What?
149228,m444,moonstruck,L391640,u6649,LORETTA,In time you will drop dead and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
149229,m444,moonstruck,L391639,u6652,MR. JOHNNY,In time you will see that this is the best thing.
149230,m444,moonstruck,L391637,u6652,MR. JOHNNY,I must ask for that back.
149231,m444,moonstruck,L391636,u6649,LORETTA,And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
149232,m444,moonstruck,L391629,u6652,MR. JOHNNY,If I marry you my mother will die.
149233,m444,moonstruck,L391628,u6649,LORETTA,WHAT?
149234,m444,moonstruck,L391627,u6652,MR. JOHNNY,Loretta I can't marry you.

149259,m444,moonstruck,L390866,u6649,LORETTA,Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned a date must be set.
149260,m444,moonstruck,L390865,u6652,MR. JOHNNY,Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
149261,m444,moonstruck,L390864,u6649,LORETTA,How about a month from today?

149266,m444,moonstruck,L390859,u6649,LORETTA,What about the wedding?
149267,m444,moonstruck,L390855,u6649,LORETTA,So we'll pick up the car we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
149268,m444,moonstruck,L390854,u6652,MR. JOHNNY,Seven-thirty.
149269,m444,moonstruck,L390853,u6649,LORETTA,What time is it?
149270,m444,moonstruck,L390845,u6649,LORETTA,You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
149271,m444,moonstruck,L390844,u6652,MR. JOHNNY,I like this ring.
149272,m444,moonstruck,L390834,u6652,MR. JOHNNY,Alright.
149273,m444,moonstruck,L390833,u6649,LORETTA,I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman you should kneel down.
149274,m444,moonstruck,L390832,u6652,MR. JOHNNY,This is a good suit.
149275,m444,moonstruck,L390831,u6649,LORETTA,Yes on the floor.

149277,m444,moonstruck,L390829,u6649,LORETTA,Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
149278,m444,moonstruck,L390828,u6652,MR. JOHNNY,I don't understand.
149279,m444,moonstruck,L390827,u6649,LORETTA,We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
149280,m444,moonstruck,L390826,u6652,MR. JOHNNY,What do you mean?
149281,m444,moonstruck,L390825,u6649,LORETTA,You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
149282,m444,moonstruck,L390824,u6652,MR. JOHNNY,Yes?
149283,m444,moonstruck,L390823,u6649,LORETTA,Are you proposing marriage to me?

149291,m444,moonstruck,L390815,u6649,LORETTA,What's the matter?
149292,m444,moonstruck,L390814,u6652,MR. JOHNNY,Never is a long time.
149293,m444,moonstruck,L390813,u6649,LORETTA,You never have dessert.
149294,m444,moonstruck,L390796,u6649,LORETTA,She was too young for him.
149295,m444,moonstruck,L390795,u6652,MR. JOHNNY,A man who can't control his woman is funny.
149296,m444,moonstruck,L390783,u6649,LORETTA,Give him the manicotta Bobo. Me too.
149297,m444,moonstruck,L390782,u6652,MR. JOHNNY,Maybe you're right.

149401,m444,moonstruck,L391509,u6652,MR. JOHNNY,I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.

149403,m444,moonstruck,L391507,u6652,MR. JOHNNY,Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib he left a hole there place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
149404,m444,moonstruck,L391506,u6660,ROSE,That was my father-in-law who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen Johnny there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?

155649,m467,out of sight,L434199,u6980,FOLEY,Yeah it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
155650,m467,out of sight,L434198,u6975,BUDDY,My sister believes in fate but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think you think there's a hell Jack?

155654,m467,out of sight,L434194,u6980,FOLEY,Tell me something Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
155655,m467,out of sight,L434193,u6975,BUDDY,Let Glenn deal with the Snoop while we're off livin' the good life.
155656,m467,out of sight,L434192,u6980,FOLEY,Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow find out what the Snoop's big plan is then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.

155659,m467,out of sight,L434189,u6975,BUDDY,No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
155660,m467,out of sight,L434188,u6980,FOLEY,Jesus look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
155661,m467,out of sight,L434187,u6975,BUDDY,Now that's a really big house.
155662,m467,out of sight,L434115,u6980,FOLEY,Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
155663,m467,out of sight,L434114,u6975,BUDDY,Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
155664,m467,out of sight,L434113,u6980,FOLEY,You didn't tell your sister about Ripley did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
155665,m467,out of sight,L434112,u6975,BUDDY,Forty-five minutes.
155666,m467,out of sight,L434111,u6980,FOLEY,How long were you with the girl?
155667,m467,out of sight,L434110,u6975,BUDDY,Two hours.

155669,m467,out of sight,L434108,u6975,BUDDY,Just hung up.
155670,m467,out of sight,L434107,u6980,FOLEY,You tell your sister about it?
155671,m467,out of sight,L434106,u6975,BUDDY,They don't stay the night Jack 'less you pay for it.
155672,m467,out of sight,L434105,u6980,FOLEY,I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
155673,m467,out of sight,L434104,u6975,BUDDY,She came up here on her vacation 'cause she likes shitty weather.
155674,m467,out of sight,L434103,u6980,FOLEY,Doesn't say what she's doing up here but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
155675,m467,out of sight,L434102,u6975,BUDDY,Outside of that.
155676,m467,out of sight,L434045,u6975,BUDDY,What's he do now tell fortunes?
155677,m467,out of sight,L434044,u6980,FOLEY,Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
155678,m467,out of sight,L434032,u6975,BUDDY,Or two.
155679,m467,out of sight,L434031,u6980,FOLEY,I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
155680,m467,out of sight,L434030,u6975,BUDDY,Whatta you think?
155681,m467,out of sight,L434017,u6980,FOLEY,Love is funny.
155682,m467,out of sight,L433938,u6980,FOLEY,She just sat there looking right at me.
155683,m467,out of sight,L433937,u6975,BUDDY,They know where I live I guess they know what I drive so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
155684,m467,out of sight,L433909,u6975,BUDDY,He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now works out at the Kronk.

155686,m467,out of sight,L433907,u6975,BUDDY,Remember Snoopy Miller his old pal from Lompoc?
155687,m467,out of sight,L433906,u6980,FOLEY,Well first off if you were Glenn you wouldn't be thinking.
155688,m467,out of sight,L433905,u6975,BUDDY,I been thinkin' if I was Glenn I was up there to take down the Ripper where would I go?
155689,m467,out of sight,L433904,u6980,FOLEY,First thing we do we get to Detroit we find Glenn then we find a window to throw him out of.

155716,m467,out of sight,L433684,u6975,BUDDY,You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most likely he's on his way to Detroit where we should be.
155717,m467,out of sight,L433683,u6980,FOLEY,Yeah but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
155718,m467,out of sight,L433682,u6975,BUDDY,Just that she got away.
155719,m467,out of sight,L433681,u6980,FOLEY,Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
155720,m467,out of sight,L433680,u6975,BUDDY,Paper says there's ten grand each on you Chino and Lulu.
155721,m467,out of sight,L433678,u6975,BUDDY,Maybe this'll make you feel better.
155722,m467,out of sight,L433677,u6980,FOLEY,I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
155723,m467,out of sight,L433676,u6975,BUDDY,They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want nobody'll know you.
155724,m467,out of sight,L433619,u6980,FOLEY,Sounds great.
155725,m467,out of sight,L433618,u6975,BUDDY,There's a store around the corner I'll be right back.
155726,m467,out of sight,L433617,u6980,FOLEY,I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know I could go for some wine tonight.
155727,m467,out of sight,L433616,u6975,BUDDY,There's something about a nice hot bath transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
155728,m467,out of sight,L433615,u6980,FOLEY,Oh man.
155729,m467,out of sight,L433614,u6975,BUDDY,There's some lilac oil you want some a vanilla candle under the sink.
155730,m467,out of sight,L433613,u6980,FOLEY,I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
155731,m467,out of sight,L433611,u6975,BUDDY,You're right.
155732,m467,out of sight,L433610,u6980,FOLEY,You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
155733,m467,out of sight,L433609,u6975,BUDDY,Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time waiting to make her move.
155734,m467,out of sight,L433608,u6980,FOLEY,I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
155735,m467,out of sight,L433538,u6975,BUDDY,You're too late Jack.
155736,m467,out of sight,L433537,u6980,FOLEY,I want to talk to her again that's all.  See what would happen under you know normal circumstances.
155737,m467,out of sight,L433518,u6975,BUDDY,He ain't the problem Jack.
155738,m467,out of sight,L433517,u6980,FOLEY,I don't know why but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
155739,m467,out of sight,L433515,u6980,FOLEY,His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you and me figured the whole thing out.
155740,m467,out of sight,L433514,u6975,BUDDY,How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
155741,m467,out of sight,L433513,u6980,FOLEY,Why you brought Glenn into this I'll never know.
155742,m467,out of sight,L433509,u6975,BUDDY,I brought 'em they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
155743,m467,out of sight,L433508,u6980,FOLEY,Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
155744,m467,out of sight,L433489,u6975,BUDDY,The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...
155745,m467,out of sight,L433488,u6980,FOLEY,Do we need him?
155746,m467,out of sight,L433480,u6980,FOLEY,Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.

155748,m467,out of sight,L433478,u6980,FOLEY,She's coming with us.
155749,m467,out of sight,L433477,u6975,BUDDY,We may as well leave her we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway what's the difference where?
155750,m467,out of sight,L433474,u6980,FOLEY,Okay honey come on out of there.
155751,m467,out of sight,L433473,u6975,BUDDY,That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
155752,m467,out of sight,L433472,u6980,FOLEY,Where in the hell are we?
155753,m467,out of sight,L433393,u6975,BUDDY,Why don't we talk about it later?
155754,m467,out of sight,L433392,u6980,FOLEY,I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
155755,m467,out of sight,L433351,u6975,BUDDY,The Wall Street guy?  Oh yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.

155934,m467,out of sight,L434327,u6983,KAREN,You're not dumb.
155935,m467,out of sight,L434325,u6983,KAREN,I don't know.
155936,m467,out of sight,L434324,u6980,FOLEY,What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
155937,m467,out of sight,L434323,u6983,KAREN,Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
155938,m467,out of sight,L434322,u6980,FOLEY,Why are you mad?
155939,m467,out of sight,L434321,u6983,KAREN,I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck if that's what you're thinking.
155940,m467,out of sight,L434320,u6983,KAREN,I'm just going to the bathroom.
155941,m467,out of sight,L434319,u6980,FOLEY,You coming back?
155942,m467,out of sight,L434314,u6980,FOLEY,Don't talk like that okay?  You scare me.
155943,m467,out of sight,L434313,u6983,KAREN,No you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
155944,m467,out of sight,L434312,u6980,FOLEY,I don't think we should get into that.
155945,m467,out of sight,L434311,u6983,KAREN,So she did help you?
155946,m467,out of sight,L434310,u6980,FOLEY,To warn her about Chino.
155947,m467,out of sight,L434309,u6983,KAREN,You were going to see her?
155948,m467,out of sight,L434308,u6980,FOLEY,Outside Adele's.
155949,m467,out of sight,L434307,u6983,KAREN,Where?
155950,m467,out of sight,L434306,u6980,FOLEY,You know I saw you on the street.
155951,m467,out of sight,L434305,u6980,FOLEY,Really?  I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.
155952,m467,out of sight,L434304,u6983,KAREN,I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then a lot wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
155953,m467,out of sight,L434303,u6980,FOLEY,I wasn't sure you caught that.
155954,m467,out of sight,L434302,u6983,KAREN,You waved to me in the elevator.
155955,m467,out of sight,L434301,u6980,FOLEY,I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you and I didn't want to leave you there never see you again.
155956,m467,out of sight,L434300,u6983,KAREN,What were you gonna do with me?
155957,m467,out of sight,L434298,u6980,FOLEY,Why not?
155958,m467,out of sight,L434297,u6983,KAREN,You believe that?
155959,m467,out of sight,L434296,u6980,FOLEY,I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
155960,m467,out of sight,L434295,u6983,KAREN,He killed a police officer.
155961,m467,out of sight,L434294,u6980,FOLEY,I might've smelled like a sewer but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
155962,m467,out of sight,L434293,u6980,FOLEY,Yeah but in a nice way.
155963,m467,out of sight,L434292,u6983,KAREN,You kept touching me feeling my thigh.
155964,m467,out of sight,L434291,u6980,FOLEY,She did huh.
155965,m467,out of sight,L434290,u6983,KAREN,Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
155966,m467,out of sight,L434289,u6980,FOLEY,That's not what you were about to say.
155967,m467,out of sight,L434288,u6983,KAREN,You really wear that suit.
155968,m467,out of sight,L434285,u6980,FOLEY,So do you.
155969,m467,out of sight,L434284,u6983,KAREN,You like taking risks.
155970,m467,out of sight,L434283,u6980,FOLEY,It would be worth the risk.
155971,m467,out of sight,L434282,u6983,KAREN,If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
155972,m467,out of sight,L434281,u6980,FOLEY,Well I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
155973,m467,out of sight,L434280,u6983,KAREN,If I had answered what were you gonna say?
155974,m467,out of sight,L434279,u6980,FOLEY,I called your room from downstairs.
155975,m467,out of sight,L434278,u6983,KAREN,Oh God...
155976,m467,out of sight,L434275,u6983,KAREN,Or once.
155977,m467,out of sight,L434273,u6983,KAREN,Well does it make sense to you?
155978,m467,out of sight,L434272,u6980,FOLEY,It's not a game.  Something you play.
155979,m467,out of sight,L434271,u6983,KAREN,It's your game.  I've never played this before.
155980,m467,out of sight,L434270,u6980,FOLEY,I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste Jesus what do they know about anything?
155981,m467,out of sight,L434269,u6983,KAREN,Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
155982,m467,out of sight,L434268,u6980,FOLEY,How far do we go with this?
155983,m467,out of sight,L434267,u6983,KAREN,No.  What do you do for a living Gary?
155984,m467,out of sight,L434266,u6980,FOLEY,Having it cleaned didn't help huh?
155985,m467,out of sight,L434265,u6983,KAREN,It smelled.
155986,m467,out of sight,L434264,u6980,FOLEY,You did?
155987,m467,out of sight,L434263,u6983,KAREN,I had one just like it -- well it was the same idea but I had to get rid of it.
155988,m467,out of sight,L434262,u6980,FOLEY,I like your hair.  And that suit.
155989,m467,out of sight,L434261,u6983,KAREN,I don't have a problem with it.
155990,m467,out of sight,L434260,u6980,FOLEY,A girl.
155991,m467,out of sight,L434259,u6983,KAREN,What as a sales rep?
155992,m467,out of sight,L434258,u6980,FOLEY,Is that how you think of yourself?
155993,m467,out of sight,L434257,u6983,KAREN,I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
155994,m467,out of sight,L434256,u6980,FOLEY,Well we got that out of the way.  Tell me Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
155995,m467,out of sight,L434255,u6983,KAREN,Love it.
155996,m467,out of sight,L434254,u6980,FOLEY,You like bourbon?
155997,m467,out of sight,L434252,u6983,KAREN,No they're all right.  I meant you just got here.
155998,m467,out of sight,L434251,u6980,FOLEY,Those guys bother you?
155999,m467,out of sight,L434250,u6983,KAREN,Don't leave me.
156000,m467,out of sight,L434249,u6980,FOLEY,I can go to the bar.
156001,m467,out of sight,L434248,u6983,KAREN,It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
156002,m467,out of sight,L433754,u6980,FOLEY,I just thought maybe you and me could--
156003,m467,out of sight,L433753,u6983,KAREN,Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
156004,m467,out of sight,L433752,u6980,FOLEY,I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands we'll make it an island.
156005,m467,out of sight,L433751,u6983,KAREN,One last score that the idea?  Move to some island.
156006,m467,out of sight,L433750,u6980,FOLEY,He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
156007,m467,out of sight,L433749,u6983,KAREN,Unless you wanna tell me.
156008,m467,out of sight,L433748,u6980,FOLEY,Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
156009,m467,out of sight,L433747,u6983,KAREN,Something I've been wondering what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
156010,m467,out of sight,L433746,u6980,FOLEY,I can just picture that a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
156011,m467,out of sight,L433745,u6983,KAREN,My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
156012,m467,out of sight,L433741,u6980,FOLEY,Because you're having too much fun.
156013,m467,out of sight,L433740,u6983,KAREN,Why not?
156014,m467,out of sight,L433739,u6980,FOLEY,You won't do that.
156015,m467,out of sight,L433738,u6983,KAREN,There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone let you two work it out.
156016,m467,out of sight,L433737,u6980,FOLEY,Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
156017,m467,out of sight,L433736,u6983,KAREN,Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place drop 'em off.
156018,m467,out of sight,L433735,u6980,FOLEY,How do we do that?
156019,m467,out of sight,L433734,u6983,KAREN,Think I could have them back?
156020,m467,out of sight,L433733,u6980,FOLEY,And your gun.
156021,m467,out of sight,L433732,u6983,KAREN,How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
156022,m467,out of sight,L433731,u6980,FOLEY,Really.  He has a cop's face.
156023,m467,out of sight,L433730,u6983,KAREN,That's my dad.
156024,m467,out of sight,L433729,u6980,FOLEY,I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
156025,m467,out of sight,L433728,u6983,KAREN,None of your business.
156026,m467,out of sight,L433727,u6980,FOLEY,Who was it answered the phone?
156027,m467,out of sight,L433726,u6983,KAREN,How'd you get this number?
156028,m467,out of sight,L433722,u6983,KAREN,Yes.
156029,m467,out of sight,L433721,u6980,FOLEY,You know who this is?
156030,m467,out of sight,L433476,u6980,FOLEY,Shit...
156031,m467,out of sight,L433475,u6983,KAREN,Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
156032,m467,out of sight,L433470,u6980,FOLEY,Uh-huh.  Well but if --
156033,m467,out of sight,L433469,u6983,KAREN,I mean romantically.
156034,m467,out of sight,L433468,u6980,FOLEY,Really.
156035,m467,out of sight,L433467,u6983,KAREN,I never thought it made sense though the way they got together so quick.
156036,m467,out of sight,L433466,u6980,FOLEY,Yeah...
156037,m467,out of sight,L433465,u6983,KAREN,With Robert Redford when he was young.
156038,m467,out of sight,L433464,u6980,FOLEY,Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.
156039,m467,out of sight,L433463,u6983,KAREN,You have to be kidding.
156040,m467,out of sight,L433462,u6980,FOLEY,I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
156041,m467,out of sight,L433461,u6983,KAREN,You'd probably tell me.
156042,m467,out of sight,L433460,u6980,FOLEY,I mean if you didn't know who I was.
156043,m467,out of sight,L433459,u6983,KAREN,Nothing.
156044,m467,out of sight,L433458,u6980,FOLEY,You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
156045,m467,out of sight,L433457,u6980,FOLEY,It wasn't pretty after no but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you.
156046,m467,out of sight,L433456,u6983,KAREN,Bleeding on a country road.
156047,m467,out of sight,L433455,u6980,FOLEY,Yeah right.  Anyway that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go if you have to.
156048,m467,out of sight,L433454,u6983,KAREN,Peter Finch.
156049,m467,out of sight,L433453,u6980,FOLEY,And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
156050,m467,out of sight,L433452,u6983,KAREN,<i>Network</i>.  Yeah she was good.
156051,m467,out of sight,L433451,u6980,FOLEY,Yeah I liked her in that movie about TV...
156052,m467,out of sight,L433450,u6983,KAREN,Faye Dunaway.
156053,m467,out of sight,L433449,u6980,FOLEY,That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
156054,m467,out of sight,L433448,u6983,KAREN,It was May 1934 near Gibsland Louisiana.
156055,m467,out of sight,L433447,u6980,FOLEY,You're full of interesting facts aren't you?
156056,m467,out of sight,L433446,u6983,KAREN,They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
156057,m467,out of sight,L433445,u6980,FOLEY,Is that right?
156058,m467,out of sight,L433444,u6983,KAREN,I don't recall his hat but I've seen pictures of him lying dead shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
156059,m467,out of sight,L433443,u6980,FOLEY,Oh you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
156060,m467,out of sight,L433442,u6983,KAREN,You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow.
156061,m467,out of sight,L433441,u6980,FOLEY,Yeah well if it turns out I get shot like a dog it'll be in the street not off a goddamn fence.
156062,m467,out of sight,L433440,u6983,KAREN,You know this isn't gonna end well these things never do.
156063,m467,out of sight,L433439,u6983,KAREN,Sure.
156064,m467,out of sight,L433438,u6980,FOLEY,We still talk though.
156065,m467,out of sight,L433437,u6983,KAREN,Uh-huh.
156066,m467,out of sight,L433436,u6980,FOLEY,It was just a year give or take a few days.  I mean it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun we just didn't have that... that thing you know?  That spark you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
156067,m467,out of sight,L433435,u6983,KAREN,You were married?  All those falls I'm surprised you had time.
156068,m467,out of sight,L433434,u6980,FOLEY,Jesus you sound like my ex-wife.
156069,m467,out of sight,L433433,u6983,KAREN,What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back take it easy and wait for you to screw up.
156070,m467,out of sight,L433432,u6980,FOLEY,You don't act like it.
156071,m467,out of sight,L433431,u6983,KAREN,Of course I am.
156072,m467,out of sight,L433430,u6980,FOLEY,You don't seem all that scared.
156073,m467,out of sight,L433429,u6983,KAREN,I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
156074,m467,out of sight,L433428,u6980,FOLEY,Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now I do a full thirty years no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
156075,m467,out of sight,L433427,u6983,KAREN,I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
156076,m467,out of sight,L433426,u6980,FOLEY,I believe you would have.  Another fall I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
156077,m467,out of sight,L433425,u6983,KAREN,It was me I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
156078,m467,out of sight,L433424,u6980,FOLEY,I thought so too.
156079,m467,out of sight,L433423,u6983,KAREN,That's funny.
156080,m467,out of sight,L433422,u6980,FOLEY,Tell you the truth I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
156081,m467,out of sight,L433421,u6983,KAREN,How many was that?
156082,m467,out of sight,L433420,u6980,FOLEY,Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
156083,m467,out of sight,L433419,u6983,KAREN,Why are you famous?
156084,m467,out of sight,L433418,u6980,FOLEY,Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
156085,m467,out of sight,L433417,u6983,KAREN,So what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
156086,m467,out of sight,L433416,u6980,FOLEY,One I gave him yeah.  Fuck...
156087,m467,out of sight,L433415,u6983,KAREN,Buddy.  That's his given name?
156088,m467,out of sight,L433414,u6980,FOLEY,Who Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up confesses his sins tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
156089,m467,out of sight,L433413,u6983,KAREN,Must be quite a pal risk his own ass like this.
156090,m467,out of sight,L433412,u6980,FOLEY,If they get set up in time which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas not a big black guy driving a Ford.
156091,m467,out of sight,L433411,u6983,KAREN,You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock they'll run the car find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
156092,m467,out of sight,L433410,u6980,FOLEY,Guys like me huh.  Well listen even though I've been celibate lately I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
156093,m467,out of sight,L433409,u6983,KAREN,The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
156094,m467,out of sight,L433408,u6980,FOLEY,Yeah went real nice with that twelve gauge too.  Tell me why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
156095,m467,out of sight,L433407,u6983,KAREN,I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
156096,m467,out of sight,L433406,u6980,FOLEY,Boy it stunk in there.

156102,m467,out of sight,L433398,u6983,KAREN,If I could have a little more room.
156103,m467,out of sight,L433397,u6980,FOLEY,You comfy?
156104,m467,out of sight,L433395,u6983,KAREN,I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest both of you guys.
156105,m467,out of sight,L433394,u6980,FOLEY,Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
156106,m467,out of sight,L434061,u6980,FOLEY,Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
156107,m467,out of sight,L434060,u6981,GLENN,I thought you guys were busted.
156108,m467,out of sight,L434043,u6981,GLENN,These guys man they're crazy.  Shit.

156111,m467,out of sight,L434040,u6980,FOLEY,What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
156112,m467,out of sight,L434039,u6980,FOLEY,Yeah?  She said that to you?
156113,m467,out of sight,L434037,u6981,GLENN,That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal for Christ sake?
156114,m467,out of sight,L434036,u6980,FOLEY,Weren't you expecting us?
156115,m467,out of sight,L433506,u6980,FOLEY,The backseat.
156116,m467,out of sight,L433505,u6981,GLENN,In the trunk?
156117,m467,out of sight,L433504,u6980,FOLEY,I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.

156119,m467,out of sight,L433502,u6980,FOLEY,Wait in the car.
156120,m467,out of sight,L433501,u6980,FOLEY,You don't take 'em off I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head.
156121,m467,out of sight,L433500,u6981,GLENN,I see better with them on.
156122,m467,out of sight,L433499,u6980,FOLEY,Take your sunglasses off.
156123,m467,out of sight,L433492,u6980,FOLEY,Oh nuthin'.

156125,m467,out of sight,L433490,u6980,FOLEY,Oh hey Studs?  We thought you were somebody else.
156126,m467,out of sight,L433370,u6980,FOLEY,Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
156127,m467,out of sight,L433369,u6981,GLENN,You think he's lying?
156128,m467,out of sight,L433368,u6980,FOLEY,My point is that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
156129,m467,out of sight,L433367,u6981,GLENN,So.  What's your point?
156130,m467,out of sight,L433366,u6980,FOLEY,Ever seen an uncut diamond Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
156131,m467,out of sight,L433365,u6981,GLENN,Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
156132,m467,out of sight,L433359,u6981,GLENN,I'll take the shades off.  Just get this fuckin' thing off me.
156133,m467,out of sight,L433358,u6980,FOLEY,I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
156134,m467,out of sight,L433357,u6981,GLENN,You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
156135,m467,out of sight,L433356,u6980,FOLEY,Who you talkin' to Studs?  Me or Buddy.  I can't tell you got those shades on.
156136,m467,out of sight,L433355,u6981,GLENN,He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that fifty mil signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
156137,m467,out of sight,L433282,u6980,FOLEY,I do but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty right before lock-down.
156139,m467,out of sight,L433280,u6980,FOLEY,Looks like tonight.

156147,m467,out of sight,L434512,u6980,FOLEY,Don't be an asshole Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
156149,m467,out of sight,L434510,u6980,FOLEY,I were you I'd get up and run.
156151,m467,out of sight,L434505,u6980,FOLEY,Dumbfuck Glenn was right there's about five million worth in there wouldn't you say Richard?
156152,m467,out of sight,L434503,u6980,FOLEY,I'm not angry Richard.  In fact I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
156154,m467,out of sight,L434495,u6980,FOLEY,Siddown Dick.  They're trying to open the safe not your maid.
156157,m467,out of sight,L434486,u6980,FOLEY,You gonna write me a check?
156159,m467,out of sight,L434477,u6980,FOLEY,A minute or two you're gonna wish you were.
156161,m467,out of sight,L434475,u6980,FOLEY,What kinda man lets a woman answer the door this time a night?
156164,m467,out of sight,L434472,u6980,FOLEY,Maurice Miller couple of his friends.
156166,m467,out of sight,L434470,u6980,FOLEY,How are you Richard?
156172,m467,out of sight,L434119,u6980,FOLEY,You goin' right back to work?
156174,m467,out of sight,L434117,u6980,FOLEY,I still haven't made up my mind yet.
156175,m467,out of sight,L434011,u6980,FOLEY,The next time I walk into a bank.
156177,m467,out of sight,L434009,u6980,FOLEY,And the guy sent you a bill for this?
156179,m467,out of sight,L434007,u6980,FOLEY,I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
156181,m467,out of sight,L434005,u6980,FOLEY,The fish?
156183,m467,out of sight,L434003,u6980,FOLEY,My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
156185,m467,out of sight,L434001,u6980,FOLEY,I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
156187,m467,out of sight,L433999,u6980,FOLEY,It's a little late for me.
156189,m467,out of sight,L433997,u6980,FOLEY,Twenty-two months three days two hours.  Why?
156192,m467,out of sight,L433994,u6980,FOLEY,Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
156194,m467,out of sight,L433992,u6980,FOLEY,Of course not.
156196,m467,out of sight,L433990,u6980,FOLEY,You're the one with balls Dick say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
156198,m467,out of sight,L433988,u6980,FOLEY,No?  Where do you keep it Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
156200,m467,out of sight,L433986,u6980,FOLEY,You'd be surprised what all you can get you ask for it the right way.
156202,m467,out of sight,L433984,u6980,FOLEY,I don't know.  I never used a gun.
156204,m467,out of sight,L433583,u6980,FOLEY,Any time.
156206,m467,out of sight,L433568,u6980,FOLEY,First of all if he kills you he's not gonna get any more money out of you.
156208,m467,out of sight,L433566,u6980,FOLEY,You're smart Ripley you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
156209,m467,out of sight,L433559,u6980,FOLEY,Must be a real soft pillow.
156212,m467,out of sight,L433373,u6980,FOLEY,You don't wanna be standing there the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
156213,m467,out of sight,L434625,u6980,FOLEY,I don't know.  It's a long way down to Florida.
156215,m467,out of sight,L434623,u6980,FOLEY,Yeah could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
156217,m467,out of sight,L434621,u6980,FOLEY,She did huh.
156219,m467,out of sight,L434619,u6980,FOLEY,And so now you're off to Glades.
156221,m467,out of sight,L434617,u6980,FOLEY,You must be some kinda walker Henry.
156223,m467,out of sight,L434615,u6980,FOLEY,The <u>ninth</u>?
156225,m467,out of sight,L434613,u6980,FOLEY,There were others.
156227,m467,out of sight,L434611,u6980,FOLEY,And how long was it before they caught up with you?
156229,m467,out of sight,L434609,u6980,FOLEY,You busted out?
156231,m467,out of sight,L434607,u6980,FOLEY,Meaning?
156233,m467,out of sight,L434605,u6980,FOLEY,You were at Leavenworth huh?
156235,m467,out of sight,L434603,u6980,FOLEY,The flight?
156238,m467,out of sight,L434599,u6980,FOLEY,<i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?
156239,m467,out of sight,L434381,u6983,KAREN,If I didn't know you Glenn by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on.
156240,m467,out of sight,L434380,u6981,GLENN,I know you'll find me.  Jesus I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer you wouldn't even know who I am.
156241,m467,out of sight,L434379,u6983,KAREN,But listen Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
156242,m467,out of sight,L434378,u6981,GLENN,Really?
156243,m467,out of sight,L434377,u6983,KAREN,You want to get out of here run it'll warm you up.
156244,m467,out of sight,L434376,u6981,GLENN,I'm freezing my ass off.
156245,m467,out of sight,L434375,u6983,KAREN,Gee I wonder why not.
156246,m467,out of sight,L434374,u6981,GLENN,I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
156247,m467,out of sight,L434373,u6983,KAREN,But you say he hasn't shown up you think he backed out?
156248,m467,out of sight,L434372,u6981,GLENN,Maurice is gonna kill him try and collect the reward.
156249,m467,out of sight,L434371,u6983,KAREN,Why's that?
156250,m467,out of sight,L434370,u6981,GLENN,He's supposed to be but he hasn't shown up yet which is a good thing for him.
156251,m467,out of sight,L434369,u6983,KAREN,And is Foley a part of this?
156252,m467,out of sight,L434368,u6981,GLENN,Yeah the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now I don't give a shit what they do.
156253,m467,out of sight,L434367,u6983,KAREN,Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
156254,m467,out of sight,L434366,u6981,GLENN,Rippin' off Ripley was my idea but these guys man they're into shit I can't handle.
156255,m467,out of sight,L434365,u6983,KAREN,But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
156256,m467,out of sight,L434364,u6981,GLENN,Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
156257,m467,out of sight,L434363,u6983,KAREN,What's going on Glenn?
156258,m467,out of sight,L434362,u6981,GLENN,Listen these guys they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
156259,m467,out of sight,L434361,u6983,KAREN,For the car for aiding and abetting a prison escape and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
156260,m467,out of sight,L434360,u6981,GLENN,You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
156261,m467,out of sight,L434359,u6983,KAREN,Glenn I know your life history who your friends are where you've been and now it looks like where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
156262,m467,out of sight,L434358,u6981,GLENN,Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?
156263,m467,out of sight,L434357,u6983,KAREN,The two guys you were with -- that one that isn't Maurice Miller is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
156264,m467,out of sight,L434356,u6981,GLENN,I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again can I?
156265,m467,out of sight,L434355,u6983,KAREN,You're not?
156266,m467,out of sight,L434354,u6981,GLENN,I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
156267,m467,out of sight,L434351,u6983,KAREN,Another one of those days huh nothing seems to go right?
156268,m467,out of sight,L434350,u6981,GLENN,Jesus I don't believe it.
156269,m467,out of sight,L434349,u6983,KAREN,Glenn are you trying to steal this car?
156270,m467,out of sight,L433640,u6981,GLENN,No way man no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.
156271,m467,out of sight,L433639,u6983,KAREN,Glenn take the exit.
156272,m467,out of sight,L433638,u6981,GLENN,What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
156273,m467,out of sight,L433637,u6983,KAREN,Take the next exit.
156274,m467,out of sight,L433534,u6983,KAREN,Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him Glenn?  At this point technically I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again get cuffed and shackled hope to God you pull a reasonable judge not some hard-on.  Or if you want to play it another way...
156275,m467,out of sight,L433533,u6981,GLENN,We're not.  I'm helping him yeah--
156276,m467,out of sight,L433532,u6983,KAREN,Look I can understand if you and Foley are close.
156277,m467,out of sight,L433531,u6983,KAREN,Foley's not going to make it.  And if he goes down Glenn you go with him.
156278,m467,out of sight,L433530,u6981,GLENN,I remember you now.  Shit.
156279,m467,out of sight,L433529,u6983,KAREN,Do we have a gun in the car?
156280,m467,out of sight,L433527,u6983,KAREN,Last fall I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
156281,m467,out of sight,L433526,u6981,GLENN,But you're sure we've met huh?
156282,m467,out of sight,L433525,u6983,KAREN,No that's not what I'm thinking.
156283,m467,out of sight,L433524,u6981,GLENN,It couldn't have been out at Glades if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
156284,m467,out of sight,L433523,u6983,KAREN,You don't remember me do you?
156285,m467,out of sight,L433522,u6983,KAREN,Glenn?
156286,m467,out of sight,L433521,u6981,GLENN,I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
156287,m467,out of sight,L433498,u6981,GLENN,Jesus what'd you crawl through a sewer?
156288,m467,out of sight,L433497,u6983,KAREN,I'll send it to you at Glades.
156289,m467,out of sight,L434028,u6981,GLENN,Why would I do that?
156290,m467,out of sight,L434027,u6987,MAURICE,No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
156291,m467,out of sight,L434026,u6981,GLENN,It's all right with you I'll just hang in the car.
156292,m467,out of sight,L434023,u6987,MAURICE,Yeah Kenneth why you have to do that to that poor girl.
156293,m467,out of sight,L434022,u6981,GLENN,Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
156294,m467,out of sight,L434021,u6987,MAURICE,That was some shit huh?
156295,m467,out of sight,L433979,u6987,MAURICE,Hey shit come on.  I say I want this car man it's mine.  You go get yourself another one.  I say I'm in on Ripley?

156296,m467,out of sight,L433978,u6981,GLENN,I think you're forgetting this is my car.  I drove it up here.
156297,m467,out of sight,L433977,u6987,MAURICE,Look Glenn I know you cool but you don't have to give me no tone of voice okay?  You don't like what I'm saying you can get out anywhere along here you want.
156298,m467,out of sight,L433976,u6981,GLENN,I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off that's your problem not mine.
156299,m467,out of sight,L433975,u6987,MAURICE,Right now son.

157770,m475,playback,L446421,u7088,BETTY,I'm supposing.
157771,m475,playback,L446420,u7101,MITCHELL,Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?

157790,m475,playback,L446306,u7101,MITCHELL,You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
157791,m475,playback,L446305,u7088,BETTY,I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it Mr. Mitchell.
157792,m475,playback,L446304,u7101,MITCHELL,Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
157793,m475,playback,L446303,u7101,MITCHELL,My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
157794,m475,playback,L446302,u7088,BETTY,No thanks I've seen Seattle.
157796,m475,playback,L446617,u7088,BETTY,They might think I was running away from something.
157798,m475,playback,L446615,u7088,BETTY,Immigration Officer?
157800,m475,playback,L446613,u7088,BETTY,How long would that take?
157802,m475,playback,L446611,u7088,BETTY,How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
157804,m475,playback,L446873,u7088,BETTY,I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
157806,m475,playback,L446871,u7088,BETTY,Bank?
157808,m475,playback,L446869,u7088,BETTY,I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
157810,m475,playback,L447454,u7089,BRANDON,If I did-I don't-now.
157811,m475,playback,L447453,u7088,BETTY,Do you think I was faking?
157812,m475,playback,L447452,u7089,BRANDON,I think you mean that.
157813,m475,playback,L447447,u7088,BETTY,Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
157814,m475,playback,L447446,u7089,BRANDON,Me?
157815,m475,playback,L447445,u7088,BETTY,If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
157816,m475,playback,L447444,u7089,BRANDON,This is it Betty.  They'll find us again fog or no fog.
157817,m475,playback,L447438,u7089,BRANDON,Shut up!  Cut it out!  Even if I have to kill both of us--
157818,m475,playback,L447437,u7088,BETTY,Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
157819,m475,playback,L447436,u7089,BRANDON,Would I want to?
157820,m475,playback,L447435,u7088,BETTY,But the next one is murder.  First the little step then the longer step  and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
157821,m475,playback,L447434,u7089,BRANDON,You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
157822,m475,playback,L447433,u7088,BETTY,Magruder does.
157823,m475,playback,L447432,u7089,BRANDON,Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him what connects him with me?
157824,m475,playback,L447431,u7088,BETTY,And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
157825,m475,playback,L447430,u7089,BRANDON,Mitchell was dead enough.
157826,m475,playback,L447429,u7088,BETTY,Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
157827,m475,playback,L447428,u7089,BRANDON,Mine?
157828,m475,playback,L447427,u7088,BETTY,And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
157829,m475,playback,L447426,u7089,BRANDON,It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
157830,m475,playback,L447424,u7089,BRANDON,I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board nobody seen you since.
157831,m475,playback,L447423,u7088,BETTY,You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.
157832,m475,playback,L447376,u7088,BETTY,So that I will never be found.
157833,m475,playback,L447375,u7089,BRANDON,Don't go soft on me baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
157834,m475,playback,L447374,u7088,BETTY,I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
157835,m475,playback,L447373,u7089,BRANDON,Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
157836,m475,playback,L447372,u7088,BETTY,You-killed-him?
157837,m475,playback,L447371,u7089,BRANDON,Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
157838,m475,playback,L447370,u7088,BETTY,He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
157839,m475,playback,L447369,u7089,BRANDON,No.  I paid him off.
157840,m475,playback,L447368,u7088,BETTY,That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him too.  Was he really following me--or you?
157841,m475,playback,L447367,u7089,BRANDON,It buys things just like any other kind.
157842,m475,playback,L447366,u7088,BETTY,The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please go where you please.  You big open-handed generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes isn't it?
157843,m475,playback,L447365,u7089,BRANDON,Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from don't you?
157844,m475,playback,L447364,u7088,BETTY,What your father did doesn't condemn you.
157845,m475,playback,L447363,u7089,BRANDON,So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
157846,m475,playback,L447362,u7088,BETTY,If it was an accident you could have told the truth.
157847,m475,playback,L447361,u7089,BRANDON,In a way.
157848,m475,playback,L447360,u7088,BETTY,Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him.
157849,m475,playback,L447359,u7089,BRANDON,I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
157850,m475,playback,L447358,u7088,BETTY,Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
157851,m475,playback,L447357,u7089,BRANDON,Including Killaine.
157852,m475,playback,L447356,u7088,BETTY,Funny I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
157853,m475,playback,L447354,u7089,BRANDON,That's right.
157854,m475,playback,L447353,u7088,BETTY,I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
157855,m475,playback,L447352,u7089,BRANDON,That and the fun of it.
157856,m475,playback,L447351,u7088,BETTY,If you're doing all this just for me.
157857,m475,playback,L447350,u7089,BRANDON,Wonder what?
157858,m475,playback,L447349,u7088,BETTY,I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
157859,m475,playback,L447347,u7089,BRANDON,Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  Careful how you go we're hitting the swell now.
157860,m475,playback,L447346,u7088,BETTY,Frozen.
157861,m475,playback,L447345,u7089,BRANDON,Cold?
157862,m475,playback,L447344,u7089,BRANDON,There would be a moon tonight.
157863,m475,playback,L447343,u7088,BETTY,I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
157864,m475,playback,L447342,u7089,BRANDON,See anything?
157865,m475,playback,L447283,u7088,BETTY,Killaine's wise to what?
157866,m475,playback,L447282,u7089,BRANDON,Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when. 
157867,m475,playback,L447271,u7088,BETTY,You leave it.
157868,m475,playback,L447270,u7089,BRANDON,Well?
157869,m475,playback,L447269,u7089,BRANDON,My father died in jail and he was twice the man I am.
157870,m475,playback,L447268,u7088,BETTY,You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
157871,m475,playback,L447267,u7089,BRANDON,I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
157872,m475,playback,L447266,u7089,BRANDON,It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
157873,m475,playback,L447265,u7088,BETTY,Do you have to leave the note?
157874,m475,playback,L447264,u7089,BRANDON,It did but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
157875,m475,playback,L447263,u7088,BETTY,This must have cost a fortune.
157876,m475,playback,L447262,u7089,BRANDON,You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
157877,m475,playback,L447244,u7089,BRANDON,The best interference runner we've got.  He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman.  Come here baby.
157878,m475,playback,L447243,u7088,BETTY,Killaine...
157879,m475,playback,L447242,u7089,BRANDON,If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
157880,m475,playback,L447241,u7088,BETTY,But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
157881,m475,playback,L447240,u7089,BRANDON,Blonde beautiful and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
157882,m475,playback,L447239,u7088,BETTY,And Betty Mayfield--
157883,m475,playback,L447238,u7089,BRANDON,I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
157884,m475,playback,L447237,u7088,BETTY,They'll look for you.
157885,m475,playback,L447236,u7089,BRANDON,This is the ace Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
157886,m475,playback,L447235,u7088,BETTY,I was tried for murdering my husband.  Guilty.  The judge set the verdict aside.  There was one man on the jury--  --but he was afraid.  They were all afraid--of my father-in-law. That man followed me last night-- he came from him of course.  My father-in-law will never give up. Never.  He promised me that.  So I came to Vancouver B.C. As far away as I can get from North Carolina.  And it happens all over again.  Almost the same thing. Almost the same way.  Do you wonder about this--
157887,m475,playback,L447234,u7089,BRANDON,How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
157888,m475,playback,L447233,u7088,BETTY,Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
157889,m475,playback,L447232,u7088,BETTY,Yes.  I've never been very far from it for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
157890,m475,playback,L447231,u7089,BRANDON,How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
157891,m475,playback,L447230,u7088,BETTY,That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
157892,m475,playback,L447229,u7089,BRANDON,There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness and open water and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you I'd be committing a crime or so they tell me.
157893,m475,playback,L447228,u7088,BETTY,Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
157894,m475,playback,L447227,u7089,BRANDON,If you meant it you wouldn't show it to me Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
157895,m475,playback,L447225,u7088,BETTY,I have my own warrant.  Stop a minute please.
157896,m475,playback,L447224,u7089,BRANDON,I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
157897,m475,playback,L447223,u7088,BETTY,They're going to arrest me.
157898,m475,playback,L447222,u7089,BRANDON,No percentage in that.
157899,m475,playback,L447221,u7088,BETTY,I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.
157900,m475,playback,L447192,u7089,BRANDON,You're probably mistaken about that.  Let's get together sand talk it over.  There's always a solution to these problems.  But it must be near the water.  Quite near--  Yes if you don't mind waiting.
157901,m475,playback,L447191,u7088,BETTY,There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
157902,m475,playback,L447190,u7089,BRANDON,Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
157903,m475,playback,L447189,u7089,BRANDON,I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.
157904,m475,playback,L447188,u7088,BETTY,I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
157905,m475,playback,L447187,u7089,BRANDON,It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
157906,m475,playback,L446867,u7089,BRANDON,From you I like it.
157907,m475,playback,L446866,u7088,BETTY,So have I.
157908,m475,playback,L446865,u7089,BRANDON,That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
157909,m475,playback,L446864,u7089,BRANDON,No use waiting then.
157910,m475,playback,L446863,u7088,BETTY,Nothing matters.
157911,m475,playback,L446862,u7089,BRANDON,It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
157912,m475,playback,L446861,u7089,BRANDON,Try not talking.
157913,m475,playback,L446860,u7088,BETTY,Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
157914,m475,playback,L446859,u7089,BRANDON,Anything I can do about it?
157915,m475,playback,L446858,u7088,BETTY,No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
157916,m475,playback,L446857,u7089,BRANDON,Why?
157917,m475,playback,L446856,u7088,BETTY,All right--following me.
157918,m475,playback,L446855,u7089,BRANDON,Us?
157919,m475,playback,L446854,u7088,BETTY,He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
157920,m475,playback,L446853,u7089,BRANDON,He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
157921,m475,playback,L446852,u7088,BETTY,You don't know who he is?
157922,m475,playback,L446851,u7089,BRANDON,He's a fellow with a very hard knee and he knows how to use it.
157923,m475,playback,L446836,u7089,BRANDON,We'll find out.
157924,m475,playback,L446835,u7088,BETTY,Absolutely sure.
157925,m475,playback,L446834,u7089,BRANDON,Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
157926,m475,playback,L446832,u7088,BETTY,Then he's-- 
157927,m475,playback,L446831,u7089,BRANDON,Couldn't be.
157928,m475,playback,L446830,u7088,BETTY,Then he's got to be a detective.
157929,m475,playback,L446829,u7089,BRANDON,Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
157930,m475,playback,L446828,u7088,BETTY,We walked right passed him. He's following us.
157931,m475,playback,L446827,u7089,BRANDON,I didn't notice him.
157932,m475,playback,L446826,u7088,BETTY,That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
157933,m475,playback,L446824,u7089,BRANDON,I know everybody. I don't look at half of life just the nice half I look at all of it.
157934,m475,playback,L446823,u7088,BETTY,They know you here--know your name.
157935,m475,playback,L446822,u7089,BRANDON,Why not?
157936,m475,playback,L446821,u7088,BETTY,Dance? Here?
157937,m475,playback,L446820,u7089,BRANDON,Want to dance?
157938,m475,playback,L446810,u7089,BRANDON,At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.
157939,m475,playback,L446809,u7088,BETTY,Is this the best you can do?
157940,m475,playback,L446808,u7089,BRANDON,Cold?
157941,m475,playback,L446802,u7089,BRANDON,I'm different. I like it fine.
157942,m475,playback,L446801,u7088,BETTY,You too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
157943,m475,playback,L446800,u7089,BRANDON,Just who are you anyway?
157944,m475,playback,L446799,u7088,BETTY,Certainly not to me.
157945,m475,playback,L446798,u7089,BRANDON,Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
157946,m475,playback,L446797,u7088,BETTY,Dance? Tonight?
157947,m475,playback,L446796,u7089,BRANDON,So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
157948,m475,playback,L446795,u7088,BETTY,There's a lot of night left to live through.
157949,m475,playback,L446794,u7089,BRANDON,Quarter after one. Why?
157950,m475,playback,L446793,u7088,BETTY,What time is it?
157951,m475,playback,L446792,u7088,BETTY,That's putting it mildly.
157952,m475,playback,L446791,u7089,BRANDON,He could hardly help suspecting you.
157953,m475,playback,L446790,u7088,BETTY,Bad enough.
157954,m475,playback,L446789,u7089,BRANDON,Bad?
157955,m475,playback,L446786,u7089,BRANDON,You didn't have to tell him that.
157956,m475,playback,L446785,u7088,BETTY,There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
157957,m475,playback,L446657,u7088,BETTY,No thanks.
157958,m475,playback,L446656,u7089,BRANDON,Want a spike in it?
157959,m475,playback,L446655,u7089,BRANDON,It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
157960,m475,playback,L446654,u7088,BETTY,There wasn't any plane.
157961,m475,playback,L446653,u7089,BRANDON,You tried to run away.
157962,m475,playback,L446652,u7089,BRANDON,I'd rather wait until it does matter.
157963,m475,playback,L446651,u7088,BETTY,Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
157964,m475,playback,L446649,u7088,BETTY,That's all there is.
157965,m475,playback,L446648,u7089,BRANDON,He was a great boy for that. What else?
157966,m475,playback,L446647,u7088,BETTY,He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
157967,m475,playback,L446646,u7089,BRANDON,Nice of him.
157968,m475,playback,L446645,u7088,BETTY,On a train. He said he lived here and he offered to make a reservation for me.
157969,m475,playback,L446644,u7089,BRANDON,How did you meet him?
157970,m475,playback,L446643,u7088,BETTY,I don't.
157971,m475,playback,L446642,u7089,BRANDON,They'll know whether he killed himself.
157972,m475,playback,L446640,u7089,BRANDON,Sure... but somebody always does..
157973,m475,playback,L446639,u7088,BETTY,No. And I've never fired a gun in my life Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
157974,m475,playback,L446637,u7088,BETTY,Not with my consent strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything.
157975,m475,playback,L446636,u7089,BRANDON,He got in here how?
157976,m475,playback,L446635,u7088,BETTY,There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
157977,m475,playback,L446632,u7088,BETTY,There's one less tonight.
157978,m475,playback,L446631,u7089,BRANDON,What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
157979,m475,playback,L446630,u7088,BETTY,You said it wasn't a tragedy.
157980,m475,playback,L446628,u7089,BRANDON,Don't take it so big... it isn't a tragedy.
157981,m475,playback,L446627,u7088,BETTY,Much too late.
157982,m475,playback,L446626,u7089,BRANDON,I know it's a littler late for an apology.
157983,m475,playback,L446569,u7088,BETTY,No thank you.
157984,m475,playback,L446568,u7089,BRANDON,Dance?
157985,m475,playback,L446488,u7089,BRANDON,He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.
157986,m475,playback,L446487,u7088,BETTY,You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
157987,m475,playback,L446486,u7089,BRANDON,Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
157988,m475,playback,L446485,u7088,BETTY,Do you think I don't?
157989,m475,playback,L446484,u7089,BRANDON,Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
157990,m475,playback,L446483,u7088,BETTY,I hate to be alone. But I've heard all the approaches there are... even yours.
157991,m475,playback,L446482,u7089,BRANDON,I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
157992,m475,playback,L446481,u7088,BETTY,I didn't say anything.
157993,m475,playback,L446480,u7089,BRANDON,Whatever you say.
157994,m475,playback,L446479,u7088,BETTY,Would it make you anymore amusing?
157995,m475,playback,L446478,u7089,BRANDON,I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact I'd like a dry Martini myself.
157996,m475,playback,L446477,u7088,BETTY,You're drinking it.
157997,m475,playback,L446476,u7089,BRANDON,No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
157998,m475,playback,L446475,u7088,BETTY,And do you amuse the guests?
157999,m475,playback,L446474,u7089,BRANDON,I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
158000,m475,playback,L446473,u7088,BETTY,You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
158001,m475,playback,L446472,u7089,BRANDON,Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before wouldn't you?
158002,m475,playback,L446471,u7088,BETTY,As I said before...
158003,m475,playback,L446470,u7089,BRANDON,No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
158004,m475,playback,L446469,u7088,BETTY,You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
158005,m475,playback,L446468,u7089,BRANDON,Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
158006,m475,playback,L446467,u7088,BETTY,What did you say his name was?
158007,m475,playback,L446466,u7089,BRANDON,It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
158008,m475,playback,L446465,u7088,BETTY,I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
158009,m475,playback,L446464,u7089,BRANDON,It might be worth a Martini to you.
158010,m475,playback,L446463,u7088,BETTY,I see.
158011,m475,playback,L446462,u7089,BRANDON,A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
158012,m475,playback,L446461,u7089,BRANDON,Disgusting aren't they? If you really want a Martini I know where you can get one.
158013,m475,playback,L446460,u7088,BETTY,Your liquor laws..
158014,m475,playback,L446450,u7088,BETTY,I see.
158015,m475,playback,L446449,u7089,BRANDON,Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
158016,m475,playback,L446448,u7088,BETTY,No please.
158017,m475,playback,L446447,u7089,BRANDON,You can have the table yourself if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
158019,m475,playback,L446458,u7088,BETTY,Ale. I don't mind.
158021,m475,playback,L446456,u7088,BETTY,Beer?  Well all right.
158023,m475,playback,L446454,u7088,BETTY,I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry please.
158025,m475,playback,L447469,u7095,KILLAINE,I understand Betty.  I understand perfectly.
158026,m475,playback,L447468,u7088,BETTY,But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
158027,m475,playback,L447467,u7095,KILLAINE,I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
158028,m475,playback,L447466,u7088,BETTY,No Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
158029,m475,playback,L447465,u7095,KILLAINE,We know everything.
158030,m475,playback,L447464,u7088,BETTY,He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
158031,m475,playback,L447092,u7095,KILLAINE,Goodbye Betty.
158032,m475,playback,L447091,u7088,BETTY,Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man Jeff.
158033,m475,playback,L447090,u7095,KILLAINE,Sometimes.
158034,m475,playback,L447089,u7088,BETTY,You do things the hard way don't you?
158035,m475,playback,L447088,u7095,KILLAINE,There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
158036,m475,playback,L447087,u7088,BETTY,But even if you were in love with me.
158037,m475,playback,L447086,u7095,KILLAINE,I know that.
158038,m475,playback,L447085,u7088,BETTY,What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
158039,m475,playback,L447084,u7095,KILLAINE,I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman like a judge has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
158040,m475,playback,L447083,u7088,BETTY,What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
158041,m475,playback,L447082,u7088,BETTY,You're still a police officer Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
158042,m475,playback,L447081,u7095,KILLAINE,That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
158043,m475,playback,L447080,u7088,BETTY,What will they do to you?
158044,m475,playback,L447079,u7095,KILLAINE,I can't answer that.
158045,m475,playback,L447078,u7088,BETTY,To do what?
158046,m475,playback,L447077,u7095,KILLAINE,You've got a couple of hours maybe.
158047,m475,playback,L447076,u7095,KILLAINE,I'm enough of a copper to do my duty.  My boss made it tough for me.  If I don't arrest you I've gone soft.  If I do it's to save my face.  I don't play those rules.
158048,m475,playback,L447075,u7088,BETTY,Because you think your in love with me?
158049,m475,playback,L447074,u7095,KILLAINE,That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
158050,m475,playback,L447073,u7088,BETTY,They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
158051,m475,playback,L447072,u7095,KILLAINE,Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
158052,m475,playback,L447071,u7088,BETTY,I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
158053,m475,playback,L447070,u7095,KILLAINE,So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
158054,m475,playback,L447069,u7088,BETTY,Looking for peanuts I suppose.
158055,m475,playback,L447068,u7095,KILLAINE,Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
158056,m475,playback,L447067,u7088,BETTY,Jeff.  Shall we go now Jeff and get it over with?
158057,m475,playback,L447066,u7095,KILLAINE,They call me Jeff.
158058,m475,playback,L447065,u7088,BETTY,What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
158059,m475,playback,L447064,u7095,KILLAINE,That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
158060,m475,playback,L447063,u7088,BETTY,Very ridiculous.
158061,m475,playback,L447062,u7095,KILLAINE,Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden just after a shower--  Clichés one and all--but good ones with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous isn't it?
158062,m475,playback,L447061,u7088,BETTY,What does he see?
158063,m475,playback,L447060,u7095,KILLAINE,He looks at the girl looks into her eyes--
158064,m475,playback,L447059,u7088,BETTY,Points very straight to her.
158065,m475,playback,L447054,u7095,KILLAINE,There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
158066,m475,playback,L447053,u7088,BETTY,You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you or you wouldn't be an inspector.
158067,m475,playback,L447052,u7095,KILLAINE,I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
158068,m475,playback,L447051,u7088,BETTY,I expected nothing else.
158069,m475,playback,L447047,u7095,KILLAINE,I've come here to arrest you for murder.
158070,m475,playback,L447046,u7088,BETTY,I don't want to talk.
158071,m475,playback,L447045,u7095,KILLAINE,This isn't a very good place to talk.
158072,m475,playback,L446954,u7088,BETTY,There isn't anything you can do.
158073,m475,playback,L446953,u7095,KILLAINE,Then there isn't much I can do is there?
158074,m475,playback,L446952,u7088,BETTY,You understand perfectly.
158075,m475,playback,L446951,u7095,KILLAINE,If I understand what you meant by that.
158076,m475,playback,L446950,u7088,BETTY,Nobody can help me. You least of all.
158077,m475,playback,L446949,u7095,KILLAINE,You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
158078,m475,playback,L446948,u7088,BETTY,You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
158079,m475,playback,L446947,u7095,KILLAINE,We try to be decent.
158080,m475,playback,L446946,u7088,BETTY,You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
158081,m475,playback,L446945,u7095,KILLAINE,I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
158082,m475,playback,L446944,u7095,KILLAINE,You've has an experience that you don't want to talk about. An unhappy marriage for example.
158083,m475,playback,L446943,u7088,BETTY,The police always do don't they?
158084,m475,playback,L446942,u7095,KILLAINE,I'll find out you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end I'll find out.
158085,m475,playback,L446940,u7095,KILLAINE,I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
158086,m475,playback,L446939,u7088,BETTY,You were there when I last saw him.
158087,m475,playback,L446938,u7095,KILLAINE,We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
158088,m475,playback,L446937,u7088,BETTY,Is it a crime?
158089,m475,playback,L446936,u7095,KILLAINE,But not in the investigation of a major crime I hope.
158090,m475,playback,L446935,u7088,BETTY,Who hasn't--one way or another?
158091,m475,playback,L446934,u7095,KILLAINE,You've had dealings with the police before?
158092,m475,playback,L446933,u7088,BETTY,You were a galahad compared to some cops I've known.
158093,m475,playback,L446932,u7095,KILLAINE,True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
158094,m475,playback,L446931,u7088,BETTY,We wouldn't have met at all.
158095,m475,playback,L446930,u7095,KILLAINE,Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club and beyond it the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances Miss Mayfield.
158096,m475,playback,L446883,u7088,BETTY,I've never been to Florida.
158097,m475,playback,L446882,u7095,KILLAINE,FLorida?
158098,m475,playback,L446881,u7095,KILLAINE,You must come from pretty far South.
158099,m475,playback,L446880,u7088,BETTY,Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
158100,m475,playback,L446879,u7095,KILLAINE,Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine the sky is a deep blue.
158101,m475,playback,L446878,u7095,KILLAINE,They're all crude when they don't work. Had breakfast?
158102,m475,playback,L446877,u7088,BETTY,Good morning Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
158103,m475,playback,L446782,u7095,KILLAINE,I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
158104,m475,playback,L446781,u7088,BETTY,Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
158105,m475,playback,L446780,u7095,KILLAINE,An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
158106,m475,playback,L446778,u7088,BETTY,A graduation present.
158107,m475,playback,L446777,u7095,KILLAINE,Where's you get it?
158108,m475,playback,L446776,u7088,BETTY,Yes.
158109,m475,playback,L446775,u7095,KILLAINE,What this?
158110,m475,playback,L446774,u7088,BETTY,Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
158111,m475,playback,L446773,u7095,KILLAINE,Stop saying you're sorry. I want information not regrets.
158112,m475,playback,L446772,u7088,BETTY,I'm sorry.
158113,m475,playback,L446771,u7095,KILLAINE,Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
158114,m475,playback,L446770,u7088,BETTY,Your family coat of arms Mr. Killaine?
158115,m475,playback,L446766,u7095,KILLAINE,There's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.
158116,m475,playback,L446765,u7088,BETTY,Who told you I was married?
158117,m475,playback,L446764,u7095,KILLAINE,Well that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
158118,m475,playback,L446738,u7088,BETTY,It is?
158119,m475,playback,L446737,u7095,KILLAINE,That's an evasion and you know it.
158120,m475,playback,L446736,u7088,BETTY,You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
158121,m475,playback,L446735,u7095,KILLAINE,Please answer my question.
158122,m475,playback,L446734,u7095,KILLAINE,Miss Mayfield the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
158123,m475,playback,L446733,u7088,BETTY,I'm sorry that's all there is.
158124,m475,playback,L446732,u7095,KILLAINE,I'll have to know a little more than that.
158125,m475,playback,L446731,u7088,BETTY,I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
158126,m475,playback,L446730,u7095,KILLAINE,You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes and money and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself Miss Mayfield.
158127,m475,playback,L446729,u7088,BETTY,I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
158128,m475,playback,L446728,u7095,KILLAINE,Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
158129,m475,playback,L446894,u7089,BRANDON,This way.
158131,m475,playback,L446889,u7089,BRANDON,Who's Goble?
158133,m475,playback,L446887,u7089,BRANDON,All right. Get him.
158135,m475,playback,L446885,u7089,BRANDON,Morning. Any calls?
158138,m475,playback,L446927,u7089,BRANDON,I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
158140,m475,playback,L446925,u7089,BRANDON,There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
158142,m475,playback,L446923,u7089,BRANDON,Got the information on you?
158144,m475,playback,L446921,u7089,BRANDON,A thousand.
158146,m475,playback,L446919,u7089,BRANDON,You mentioned information.
158148,m475,playback,L446917,u7089,BRANDON,For two hundred?
158150,m475,playback,L446915,u7089,BRANDON,For five hundred what do I get?
158152,m475,playback,L446913,u7089,BRANDON,If I call the police your price will go down to a minus sign.
158154,m475,playback,L446911,u7089,BRANDON,I don't know whether to knock your teeth down your throat--or call the police--or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose.
158156,m475,playback,L446909,u7089,BRANDON,That's a nice hard knee you've got Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
158158,m475,playback,L446907,u7089,BRANDON,What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
158160,m475,playback,L446905,u7089,BRANDON,What are your rates?
158162,m475,playback,L446903,u7089,BRANDON,Private eye?
158164,m475,playback,L446901,u7089,BRANDON,Name it.
158166,m475,playback,L446899,u7089,BRANDON,I'm still asking. What do you want?
158168,m475,playback,L446897,u7089,BRANDON,Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
158169,m475,playback,L446892,u7089,BRANDON,I'm not interested in blind dates.
158171,m475,playback,L446668,u7099,MARGO,That comedian?
158172,m475,playback,L446667,u7089,BRANDON,Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
158173,m475,playback,L446666,u7099,MARGO,I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
158174,m475,playback,L446662,u7099,MARGO,They still hang women in Canada I've heard.
158175,m475,playback,L446661,u7089,BRANDON,Leave that one lay.
158176,m475,playback,L446660,u7099,MARGO,And without much discrimination.
158177,m475,playback,L446659,u7089,BRANDON,Sometimes.
158178,m475,playback,L446658,u7099,MARGO,You make friends quickly don't you Clark?
158179,m475,playback,L446524,u7089,BRANDON,You Killaine?
158180,m475,playback,L446523,u7099,MARGO,Martini.
158181,m475,playback,L446522,u7089,BRANDON,What'll you have Margo?
158182,m475,playback,L446521,u7099,MARGO,Fascinated.
158183,m475,playback,L446520,u7089,BRANDON,Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine Mrs. West.
158184,m475,playback,L446519,u7099,MARGO,In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
158185,m475,playback,L446518,u7089,BRANDON,Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
158186,m475,playback,L446848,u7089,BRANDON,I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells I don't like you.
158189,m475,playback,L446845,u7089,BRANDON,How are your teeth getting along?
158191,m475,playback,L446843,u7089,BRANDON,Who told you my name?
158193,m475,playback,L446841,u7089,BRANDON,So you're not a cop.
158195,m475,playback,L446839,u7089,BRANDON,All right let's see the buzzer.
158196,m475,playback,L447211,u7095,KILLAINE,Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
158197,m475,playback,L447210,u7089,BRANDON,You asked me where it all came from.
158198,m475,playback,L447209,u7095,KILLAINE,What?
158199,m475,playback,L447208,u7089,BRANDON,I had a father who knew how to steal.
158200,m475,playback,L447207,u7095,KILLAINE,Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?
158201,m475,playback,L447206,u7089,BRANDON,I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
158202,m475,playback,L447205,u7095,KILLAINE,I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
158203,m475,playback,L447204,u7089,BRANDON,Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
158204,m475,playback,L447203,u7095,KILLAINE,You do a lot of real estate trading Brandon?
158205,m475,playback,L447202,u7089,BRANDON,Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
158206,m475,playback,L447201,u7095,KILLAINE,I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
158207,m475,playback,L447200,u7089,BRANDON,You forgetting the gag line Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
158208,m475,playback,L447198,u7089,BRANDON,Where would she go anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
158209,m475,playback,L447197,u7095,KILLAINE,No more for me thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
158210,m475,playback,L447181,u7089,BRANDON,No idea.
158211,m475,playback,L447180,u7095,KILLAINE,You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
158212,m475,playback,L447179,u7089,BRANDON,Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale Killaine.
158213,m475,playback,L447178,u7095,KILLAINE,Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself then wandered out on this balcony then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
158214,m475,playback,L447177,u7089,BRANDON,Mitchell was too drunk.
158215,m475,playback,L447176,u7095,KILLAINE,She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
158216,m475,playback,L447175,u7089,BRANDON,How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here is it likely she'd let him in?
158217,m475,playback,L447174,u7095,KILLAINE,Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
158218,m475,playback,L447173,u7089,BRANDON,And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive too.  Margo and her money.
158219,m475,playback,L447172,u7089,BRANDON,Your concentrating too hard Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
158220,m475,playback,L447171,u7095,KILLAINE,Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
158221,m475,playback,L447170,u7089,BRANDON,That COULD BE TOLD.
158222,m475,playback,L447169,u7095,KILLAINE,It could have been an accident.
158223,m475,playback,L447168,u7089,BRANDON,Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
158224,m475,playback,L447167,u7095,KILLAINE,Information.
158225,m475,playback,L447166,u7089,BRANDON,You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
158226,m475,playback,L447165,u7095,KILLAINE,The only answer I have for you.
158227,m475,playback,L447164,u7089,BRANDON,Doesn't answer the question.
158228,m475,playback,L447163,u7095,KILLAINE,You'd be breaking the law.
158229,m475,playback,L447162,u7089,BRANDON,Would that make me a heel?
158230,m475,playback,L447161,u7095,KILLAINE,I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
158231,m475,playback,L447160,u7089,BRANDON,That must hurt.
158232,m475,playback,L447159,u7095,KILLAINE,I have a warrant for her arrest.
158233,m475,playback,L447158,u7089,BRANDON,A couple of hours.
158234,m475,playback,L447157,u7095,KILLAINE,Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
158235,m475,playback,L447156,u7089,BRANDON,Could we discuss that some other time?
158236,m475,playback,L447154,u7089,BRANDON,I wouldn't know.
158237,m475,playback,L447153,u7095,KILLAINE,I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
158238,m475,playback,L447152,u7089,BRANDON,I never notice the view after the first week.
158239,m475,playback,L447151,u7095,KILLAINE,Thanks.  Lovely view you have haven't you?
158240,m475,playback,L447149,u7095,KILLAINE,Thanks.  I don't mind.
158241,m475,playback,L447148,u7089,BRANDON,If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
158242,m475,playback,L447147,u7095,KILLAINE,Time for a little chat?
158243,m475,playback,L446807,u7089,BRANDON,Well--good night.
158244,m475,playback,L446806,u7095,KILLAINE,I don't.
158245,m475,playback,L446805,u7089,BRANDON,In case you want to have us followed.
158246,m475,playback,L446784,u7095,KILLAINE,Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something I know less than I did before.  Well I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
158247,m475,playback,L446783,u7089,BRANDON,How are you two getting along?
158248,m475,playback,L446726,u7095,KILLAINE,No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for say half and hour?
158249,m475,playback,L446725,u7089,BRANDON,How about a cup of coffee?
158250,m475,playback,L446713,u7095,KILLAINE,We do when we get the chance.
158251,m475,playback,L446712,u7089,BRANDON,Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens one doesn't use a tape measure.
158252,m475,playback,L446711,u7095,KILLAINE,It was lying where on the balcony?
158253,m475,playback,L446710,u7089,BRANDON,No.
158254,m475,playback,L446709,u7095,KILLAINE,I rather thought so. And before that had you ever seen the gun?
158255,m475,playback,L446708,u7089,BRANDON,Could be.
158256,m475,playback,L446707,u7095,KILLAINE,Quite sure you had no motive?
158257,m475,playback,L446706,u7089,BRANDON,On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
158258,m475,playback,L446705,u7095,KILLAINE,Where?
158259,m475,playback,L446704,u7089,BRANDON,Yes I've seen it before.
158260,m475,playback,L446703,u7095,KILLAINE,Thank you.
158261,m475,playback,L446580,u7089,BRANDON,That's what I thought at first.  Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party.  With my liquor of course.
158262,m475,playback,L446579,u7095,KILLAINE,She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
158263,m475,playback,L446578,u7089,BRANDON,Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
158264,m475,playback,L446577,u7095,KILLAINE,Hardly. Who's the girl?
158265,m475,playback,L446576,u7089,BRANDON,Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?
158266,m475,playback,L446544,u7095,KILLAINE,If I can get off.
158267,m475,playback,L446543,u7089,BRANDON,Round of golf Saturday?
158268,m475,playback,L446542,u7095,KILLAINE,The usual grind.
158269,m475,playback,L446541,u7089,BRANDON,How's life treating you?
158270,m475,playback,L446540,u7095,KILLAINE,That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
158271,m475,playback,L446530,u7089,BRANDON,You're not English.
158272,m475,playback,L446529,u7095,KILLAINE,It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
158273,m475,playback,L446528,u7095,KILLAINE,A private joke.
158274,m475,playback,L446527,u7089,BRANDON,What?
158275,m475,playback,L446566,u7089,BRANDON,Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
158276,m475,playback,L446565,u7101,MITCHELL,You don't throw guests out Brandon.
158277,m475,playback,L446564,u7089,BRANDON,Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
158278,m475,playback,L446563,u7101,MITCHELL,How would you know Brandon?
158279,m475,playback,L446562,u7089,BRANDON,I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
158280,m475,playback,L446561,u7101,MITCHELL,Did I do something wrong?
158281,m475,playback,L446560,u7089,BRANDON,Do me a favor Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
158282,m475,playback,L446498,u7101,MITCHELL,Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it baby?
158283,m475,playback,L446497,u7089,BRANDON,Lay off can't you?
158284,m475,playback,L446496,u7101,MITCHELL,What's the matter baby. Don't you like me anymore?
158285,m475,playback,L446495,u7101,MITCHELL,The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
158286,m475,playback,L446494,u7089,BRANDON,Hello Mitchell. Having fun?
158287,m475,playback,L446413,u7101,MITCHELL,Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
158289,m475,playback,L446411,u7101,MITCHELL,I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
158291,m475,playback,L446409,u7101,MITCHELL,A little something on account perhaps?
158293,m475,playback,L446407,u7101,MITCHELL,Good afternoon Mr. Campbell.
158295,m475,playback,L446760,u7099,MARGO,Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
158297,m475,playback,L446758,u7099,MARGO,You could have got in that room just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
158299,m475,playback,L446756,u7099,MARGO,One of these days you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
158301,m475,playback,L446754,u7099,MARGO,They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
158303,m475,playback,L446752,u7099,MARGO,He saw my face too.
158305,m475,playback,L446750,u7099,MARGO,That's not enough.
158308,m475,playback,L446747,u7099,MARGO,You nasty sardonic--
158310,m475,playback,L446745,u7099,MARGO,Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it but I loved him.
158311,m475,playback,L446743,u7099,MARGO,Passkey?
158313,m475,playback,L446741,u7099,MARGO,What do you want?
158315,m475,playback,L446739,u7099,MARGO,What are you doing here?
158316,m475,playback,L446664,u7099,MARGO,Oh shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
158319,m475,playback,L446354,u7099,MARGO,I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
158321,m475,playback,L446714,u7095,KILLAINE,I needn't keep you any longer Mr. Clarendon.
158322,m475,playback,L446699,u7095,KILLAINE,Thank you.
158324,m475,playback,L446697,u7095,KILLAINE,Recently then.
158326,m475,playback,L446695,u7095,KILLAINE,Mr. Clarendon have you ever seen this before?
158327,m475,playback,L447401,u7095,KILLAINE,We don't need him.
158329,m475,playback,L447399,u7095,KILLAINE,What's the face for Driscoll?
158330,m475,playback,L447146,u7095,KILLAINE,Men like you don't need orders.
158332,m475,playback,L447144,u7095,KILLAINE,The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
158334,m475,playback,L447142,u7095,KILLAINE,Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
158336,m475,playback,L447140,u7095,KILLAINE,Would you?
158338,m475,playback,L447138,u7095,KILLAINE,I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble address so-and-so has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner name something-something Greer refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll Vancouver British Columbia Police. 
158340,m475,playback,L447136,u7095,KILLAINE,I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
158342,m475,playback,L447134,u7095,KILLAINE,Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
158345,m475,playback,L447131,u7095,KILLAINE,I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
158348,m475,playback,L447034,u7095,KILLAINE,And don't get too logical Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
158349,m475,playback,L447033,u7095,KILLAINE,Let me know when you've identified him
158351,m475,playback,L447031,u7095,KILLAINE,Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
158353,m475,playback,L447029,u7095,KILLAINE,You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
158355,m475,playback,L447027,u7095,KILLAINE,Floater?
158371,m475,playback,L447341,u7095,KILLAINE,A think wire---but very very strong.  Let's get out of here.
158373,m475,playback,L447338,u7095,KILLAINE,And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
158375,m475,playback,L447336,u7095,KILLAINE,Did we ever really think it was suicide?
158377,m475,playback,L447334,u7095,KILLAINE,If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
158379,m475,playback,L447332,u7095,KILLAINE,He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark listening he'd know when she came home know when she found Mitchell dead know what she did about it.  If she telephoned he'd probably hear that.
158382,m475,playback,L447329,u7095,KILLAINE,So?
158384,m475,playback,L447327,u7095,KILLAINE,Well.  What about it?
158386,m475,playback,L447322,u7095,KILLAINE,You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.
158388,m475,playback,L447320,u7095,KILLAINE,You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
158390,m475,playback,L447318,u7095,KILLAINE,You can find out.
158392,m475,playback,L447316,u7095,KILLAINE,Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
158394,m475,playback,L447314,u7095,KILLAINE,Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life rob me of my friends my position.
158396,m475,playback,L447312,u7095,KILLAINE,They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
158398,m475,playback,L447310,u7095,KILLAINE,You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
158400,m475,playback,L447306,u7095,KILLAINE,Where's the shell?
158402,m475,playback,L447304,u7095,KILLAINE,Was that about the right angle?
158403,m475,playback,L447301,u7095,KILLAINE,There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
158405,m475,playback,L447299,u7095,KILLAINE,Not too hard is it?
158406,m475,playback,L447297,u7095,KILLAINE,Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
158408,m475,playback,L447280,u7095,KILLAINE,Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
158411,m475,playback,L447275,u7095,KILLAINE,I'll know when I find it.
158413,m475,playback,L446691,u7095,KILLAINE,I've always looked forward to it. All right let's get him out of here and tidy up.
158415,m475,playback,L446689,u7095,KILLAINE,So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
158417,m475,playback,L446687,u7095,KILLAINE,So the shell ought to have gone over?
158420,m475,playback,L446681,u7095,KILLAINE,Pearl-handled .25 Automatic uh?  No it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
158422,m475,playback,L446679,u7095,KILLAINE,I've met her.
158425,m475,playback,L446676,u7095,KILLAINE,I knew him. He was easy to dislike poor chap.
158427,m475,playback,L446673,u7095,KILLAINE,So it seems Sergeant.
158429,m475,playback,L447002,u7095,KILLAINE,You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning Mrs. West.
158430,m475,playback,L447001,u7099,MARGO,And if you didn't believe me?
158431,m475,playback,L447000,u7095,KILLAINE,Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
158432,m475,playback,L446999,u7099,MARGO,Now you're being beastly.
158433,m475,playback,L446998,u7095,KILLAINE,Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
158434,m475,playback,L446997,u7099,MARGO,I don't understand.
158435,m475,playback,L446996,u7095,KILLAINE,I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
158436,m475,playback,L446995,u7099,MARGO,It does.  May I go now? 
158437,m475,playback,L446994,u7095,KILLAINE,Not if it clears the air.
158438,m475,playback,L446993,u7099,MARGO,At first it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
158439,m475,playback,L446992,u7095,KILLAINE,Mortar shells are not funny either.
158440,m475,playback,L446991,u7099,MARGO,Did you ever have a serious operation?
158441,m475,playback,L446990,u7095,KILLAINE,You didn't play it for laughs last night.
158442,m475,playback,L446989,u7099,MARGO,Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
158443,m475,playback,L446988,u7095,KILLAINE,That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell weren't you?
158444,m475,playback,L446987,u7099,MARGO,I am a fool.
158445,m475,playback,L446986,u7095,KILLAINE,Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
158446,m475,playback,L446985,u7099,MARGO,You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
158447,m475,playback,L446984,u7099,MARGO,It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
158448,m475,playback,L446983,u7095,KILLAINE,Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
158449,m475,playback,L446982,u7099,MARGO,How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything do you.
158450,m475,playback,L446981,u7095,KILLAINE,Remember that time didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
158451,m475,playback,L446724,u7095,KILLAINE,Thank you very much Mrs. West.
158452,m475,playback,L446723,u7099,MARGO,I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
158453,m475,playback,L446722,u7095,KILLAINE,Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
158454,m475,playback,L446721,u7099,MARGO,Anybody could commit suicide if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
158455,m475,playback,L446720,u7095,KILLAINE,I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
158456,m475,playback,L446719,u7099,MARGO,I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
158457,m475,playback,L446718,u7095,KILLAINE,You knew Mitchell pretty well didn't you Mrs. West?
158458,m475,playback,L446717,u7095,KILLAINE,Not quiet yet.
158459,m475,playback,L446716,u7099,MARGO,What about me?
158460,m475,playback,L446702,u7095,KILLAINE,Positive?
158461,m475,playback,L446701,u7099,MARGO,I never saw it before.
158462,m475,playback,L446526,u7099,MARGO,Warm water no doubt.
158463,m475,playback,L446525,u7095,KILLAINE,Scotch and plain water I think.
158464,m475,playback,L446517,u7099,MARGO,Are you always this witty?
158465,m475,playback,L446516,u7095,KILLAINE,Oh nothing.
158466,m475,playback,L446515,u7099,MARGO,May you what?
158467,m475,playback,L446512,u7095,KILLAINE,I never wear a hat.  Oh so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again Mrs. West.
158468,m475,playback,L446511,u7099,MARGO,Oh the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
158470,m475,playback,L447397,u7095,KILLAINE,The card says so doesn't it?
158472,m475,playback,L447392,u7095,KILLAINE,I'll take your word.
158474,m475,playback,L447390,u7095,KILLAINE,She might.
158476,m475,playback,L447388,u7095,KILLAINE,Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
158478,m475,playback,L447386,u7095,KILLAINE,That leaves two strangers.
158480,m475,playback,L447384,u7095,KILLAINE,How about Magruder?
158483,m475,playback,L447380,u7095,KILLAINE,I'm interested in who handled it.
158486,m475,playback,L447125,u7095,KILLAINE,What are my orders sir?
158489,m475,playback,L447122,u7095,KILLAINE,Not too far I hope.
158491,m475,playback,L447120,u7095,KILLAINE,Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
158493,m475,playback,L447118,u7095,KILLAINE,Two.
158495,m475,playback,L447115,u7095,KILLAINE,I do.
158497,m475,playback,L447113,u7095,KILLAINE,I think you'd be entirely justified sir.
158498,m475,playback,L447110,u7095,KILLAINE,Identification on possible Sir. Not conclusive.
158499,m475,playback,L447108,u7095,KILLAINE,Yes sir.
158501,m475,playback,L447106,u7095,KILLAINE,We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
158503,m475,playback,L447104,u7095,KILLAINE,I disagree sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion the right to act on it.
158505,m475,playback,L447102,u7095,KILLAINE,Nobody's covering her I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
158507,m475,playback,L447100,u7095,KILLAINE,I don't know sir.
158509,m475,playback,L447098,u7095,KILLAINE,A little of both sir and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
158512,m475,playback,L447020,u7095,KILLAINE,Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
158514,m475,playback,L447016,u7095,KILLAINE,Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
158516,m475,playback,L447014,u7095,KILLAINE,No.
158518,m475,playback,L447010,u7095,KILLAINE,She's a suspect naturally.  But not the only one.
158520,m475,playback,L447008,u7095,KILLAINE,How do you do sir.
158522,m475,playback,L446548,u7101,MITCHELL,Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
158523,m475,playback,L446547,u7099,MARGO,You're very attractive my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
158524,m475,playback,L446537,u7101,MITCHELL,I say YES!
158525,m475,playback,L446536,u7099,MARGO,She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
158526,m475,playback,L446535,u7101,MITCHELL,In that case there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there.
158527,m475,playback,L446534,u7099,MARGO,I have no intension of being nasty Mr. Mitchell.
158528,m475,playback,L446533,u7101,MITCHELL,Be nasty.
158529,m475,playback,L446532,u7099,MARGO,It's quite unimportant Mr. Mitchell. After all you got what you wanted.
158530,m475,playback,L446531,u7101,MITCHELL,I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
158531,m475,playback,L446406,u7099,MARGO,In an hour Larry.
158532,m475,playback,L446405,u7101,MITCHELL,Right.
158533,m475,playback,L446404,u7099,MARGO,A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
158534,m475,playback,L446403,u7101,MITCHELL,I told you she's just..
158535,m475,playback,L446402,u7099,MARGO,How about your new friend?
158536,m475,playback,L446401,u7101,MITCHELL,Of course.
158537,m475,playback,L446400,u7099,MARGO,Oh forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
158538,m475,playback,L446399,u7101,MITCHELL,I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
158539,m475,playback,L446398,u7099,MARGO,You already have the checks darling.
158540,m475,playback,L446397,u7101,MITCHELL,It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
158541,m475,playback,L446396,u7099,MARGO,Years why?
158542,m475,playback,L446395,u7101,MITCHELL,How long have you had it?
158543,m475,playback,L446394,u7099,MARGO,What does it look like?
158544,m475,playback,L446393,u7101,MITCHELL,What's this?
158545,m475,playback,L446392,u7099,MARGO,Kind or not kind. What's the difference? It always ends up the same way.
158546,m475,playback,L446391,u7101,MITCHELL,That's not very kind.
158547,m475,playback,L446390,u7099,MARGO,I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
158548,m475,playback,L446388,u7099,MARGO,I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh what's the use. You're you.
158549,m475,playback,L446387,u7101,MITCHELL,It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
158550,m475,playback,L446386,u7099,MARGO,You don't have to make a pose of it.
158551,m475,playback,L446385,u7101,MITCHELL,I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
158552,m475,playback,L446383,u7099,MARGO,She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
158553,m475,playback,L446382,u7101,MITCHELL,What'll we do about it Margo?
158554,m475,playback,L446381,u7101,MITCHELL,Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me.
158555,m475,playback,L446380,u7099,MARGO,You'd go to jail. For a long term.
158556,m475,playback,L446379,u7101,MITCHELL,I have a rough idea.
158557,m475,playback,L446378,u7099,MARGO,You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
158558,m475,playback,L446377,u7101,MITCHELL,I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
158559,m475,playback,L446375,u7099,MARGO,Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
158560,m475,playback,L446374,u7101,MITCHELL,I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
158561,m475,playback,L446373,u7099,MARGO,You ought to know why.
158562,m475,playback,L446372,u7101,MITCHELL,Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
158563,m475,playback,L446371,u7099,MARGO,She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich I hope.
158564,m475,playback,L446370,u7101,MITCHELL,Margo darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
158565,m475,playback,L446369,u7099,MARGO,As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
158566,m475,playback,L446368,u7101,MITCHELL,You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
158567,m475,playback,L446367,u7099,MARGO,Why should I mind?
158568,m475,playback,L446366,u7101,MITCHELL,She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
158569,m475,playback,L446365,u7099,MARGO,Nice.
158570,m475,playback,L446364,u7101,MITCHELL,Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
158571,m475,playback,L446363,u7099,MARGO,Who's the girl?
158572,m475,playback,L446362,u7101,MITCHELL,So-so.
158573,m475,playback,L446361,u7099,MARGO,With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
158574,m475,playback,L446360,u7101,MITCHELL,I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me Margo.
162052,m495,route 9,L476127,u7327,DWAYNE,Don't lie to me!!!!
162053,m495,route 9,L476126,u7324,BOOTH,I don't know what you're -
162054,m495,route 9,L476125,u7327,DWAYNE,Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked did you! Where's the rest?
162055,m495,route 9,L476124,u7324,BOOTH,Dwayne listen to me -
162056,m495,route 9,L476123,u7327,DWAYNE,I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
162057,m495,route 9,L475831,u7324,BOOTH,I can't get enough of it.
162058,m495,route 9,L475830,u7327,DWAYNE,Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
162059,m495,route 9,L475485,u7327,DWAYNE,I want to get some hounds down here.
162060,m495,route 9,L475484,u7324,BOOTH,Damn.
162061,m495,route 9,L475473,u7324,BOOTH,None of them had any --
162062,m495,route 9,L475472,u7327,DWAYNE,I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?
162063,m495,route 9,L475464,u7324,BOOTH,Looks like some kind of drug deal or something they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
162064,m495,route 9,L475463,u7327,DWAYNE,What the hell happened here?
162065,m495,route 9,L475314,u7324,BOOTH,Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
162066,m495,route 9,L475313,u7327,DWAYNE,Sort of!
162067,m495,route 9,L476165,u7324,BOOTH,Rock solid.
162068,m495,route 9,L476164,u7328,EARL,And you're solid on that?
162069,m495,route 9,L476163,u7324,BOOTH,Uh huh.
162070,m495,route 9,L476162,u7328,EARL,That'll bring me down too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.
162071,m495,route 9,L476158,u7324,BOOTH,I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
162072,m495,route 9,L476157,u7328,EARL,Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.
162073,m495,route 9,L476156,u7324,BOOTH,It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
162074,m495,route 9,L476155,u7328,EARL,You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne and it's all ours.
162075,m495,route 9,L476153,u7324,BOOTH,Yes it is.  I'm calling it in.  Right now.
162076,m495,route 9,L476152,u7328,EARL,It's NOT too late!
162077,m495,route 9,L476151,u7324,BOOTH,It's too late...
162078,m495,route 9,L476148,u7328,EARL,Dwayne had the opportunity just like us.  He was at the scene.  He grabbed the cash.  Of course.  This is perfect!
162079,m495,route 9,L476147,u7324,BOOTH,What are you talking about?
162080,m495,route 9,L476145,u7328,EARL,I know I know.  Dwayne's dead but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
162081,m495,route 9,L476144,u7324,BOOTH,Dwayne's dead.
162082,m495,route 9,L476143,u7328,EARL,What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work.
162083,m495,route 9,L476142,u7324,BOOTH,No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
162084,m495,route 9,L476141,u7328,EARL,We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
162085,m495,route 9,L476140,u7324,BOOTH,He killed her...
162086,m495,route 9,L476139,u7328,EARL,Booth listen to me...Booth!
162087,m495,route 9,L476138,u7324,BOOTH,He found us he shot her...he killed her...
162088,m495,route 9,L476137,u7328,EARL,What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
162089,m495,route 9,L476136,u7324,BOOTH,He killed her...he killed her...
162090,m495,route 9,L476135,u7328,EARL,Oh Jesus...
162091,m495,route 9,L476100,u7324,BOOTH,Then Sally comes too.
162092,m495,route 9,L476099,u7328,EARL,That's right.
162093,m495,route 9,L476098,u7324,BOOTH,We've got to go now then.
162094,m495,route 9,L476097,u7328,EARL,We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked there's ways around it.
162095,m495,route 9,L476096,u7324,BOOTH,We're not?  How do you figure that?
162096,m495,route 9,L476095,u7328,EARL,No we're not.
162097,m495,route 9,L476094,u7324,BOOTH,Then we're screwed.
162098,m495,route 9,L476093,u7328,EARL,I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
162099,m495,route 9,L476092,u7324,BOOTH,It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
162100,m495,route 9,L476091,u7328,EARL,I don't know for sure but why else would they head for the bank?
162101,m495,route 9,L476006,u7324,BOOTH,I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
162102,m495,route 9,L476005,u7328,EARL,Do you have everything?
162103,m495,route 9,L476004,u7328,EARL,Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
162104,m495,route 9,L476003,u7324,BOOTH,Maybe we should say somethin'.
162105,m495,route 9,L475999,u7328,EARL,Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
162106,m495,route 9,L475998,u7324,BOOTH,You don't know if he was really gonna --
162107,m495,route 9,L475997,u7328,EARL,We're doing what we gotta do to protect ourselves!
162108,m495,route 9,L475996,u7324,BOOTH,Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
162109,m495,route 9,L475989,u7324,BOOTH,Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
162110,m495,route 9,L475988,u7328,EARL,It's gonna be o.k.
162111,m495,route 9,L475987,u7324,BOOTH,You killed him...
162112,m495,route 9,L475986,u7328,EARL,Even if we have the tape that wouldn't shut him up!
162113,m495,route 9,L475980,u7328,EARL,There it is...now what about the others?
162114,m495,route 9,L475979,u7324,BOOTH,Here it is.
162115,m495,route 9,L475977,u7328,EARL,I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
162116,m495,route 9,L475976,u7324,BOOTH,What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
162117,m495,route 9,L475958,u7328,EARL,I don't know!  Shit give me a break!
162118,m495,route 9,L475957,u7324,BOOTH,How long is it going to take?!
162119,m495,route 9,L475889,u7328,EARL,Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
162120,m495,route 9,L475888,u7324,BOOTH,Not bad enough to kill him.
162121,m495,route 9,L475887,u7328,EARL,How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
162122,m495,route 9,L475886,u7324,BOOTH,You're crazy.
162123,m495,route 9,L475884,u7328,EARL,I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
162124,m495,route 9,L475883,u7324,BOOTH,Well what are we supposed to do?
162125,m495,route 9,L475882,u7328,EARL,I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides I'm not giving him a third of anything not after everything we had to do.
162126,m495,route 9,L475881,u7324,BOOTH,Maybe we can reason with Jesse give him a third in exchange for the tape.
162127,m495,route 9,L475880,u7328,EARL,If you're any friend at all you'll stop talking like that!
162128,m495,route 9,L475879,u7324,BOOTH,Look Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
162129,m495,route 9,L475878,u7328,EARL,Neither do I.
162130,m495,route 9,L475877,u7324,BOOTH,No.
162131,m495,route 9,L475876,u7328,EARL,You think he's bluffing?
162132,m495,route 9,L475870,u7324,BOOTH,Yeah I mean you're coming unglued Jesse.
162133,m495,route 9,L475869,u7328,EARL,You're out of your mind.
162134,m495,route 9,L475718,u7328,EARL,Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
162135,m495,route 9,L475717,u7324,BOOTH,You said that last time!
162136,m495,route 9,L475716,u7328,EARL,For Christ's sake Booth I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
162137,m495,route 9,L475715,u7324,BOOTH,We had a deal!  What was I talking to the wall?
162138,m495,route 9,L475712,u7324,BOOTH,He's a partner now Earl like it or not.
162139,m495,route 9,L475711,u7328,EARL,He's going to be trouble.
162140,m495,route 9,L475710,u7328,EARL,Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
162141,m495,route 9,L475709,u7324,BOOTH,He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
162142,m495,route 9,L475708,u7328,EARL,All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
162143,m495,route 9,L475707,u7324,BOOTH,And how do you figure we do that?
162144,m495,route 9,L475706,u7328,EARL,I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
162145,m495,route 9,L475705,u7324,BOOTH,...Or get rid of the money.  I don't know.
162146,m495,route 9,L475704,u7324,BOOTH,Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
162147,m495,route 9,L475703,u7328,EARL,Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
162148,m495,route 9,L475702,u7324,BOOTH,All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
162149,m495,route 9,L475701,u7328,EARL,I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
162150,m495,route 9,L475629,u7328,EARL,Exactly.  This is our little secret partner.
162151,m495,route 9,L475628,u7324,BOOTH,He would have done it to us right?
162152,m495,route 9,L475627,u7328,EARL,Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
162153,m495,route 9,L475626,u7324,BOOTH,That's not what I mean.
162154,m495,route 9,L475625,u7328,EARL,Okay then.  I'll do it.
162155,m495,route 9,L475624,u7324,BOOTH,I can't do that.
162156,m495,route 9,L475622,u7324,BOOTH,You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
162157,m495,route 9,L475621,u7328,EARL,I don't know...
162158,m495,route 9,L475620,u7324,BOOTH,What are you thinking?
162159,m495,route 9,L475619,u7328,EARL,Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
162160,m495,route 9,L475616,u7324,BOOTH,He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
162161,m495,route 9,L475615,u7328,EARL,How long you been lying there playing possum with us huh? Answer me!
162162,m495,route 9,L475564,u7328,EARL,Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
162163,m495,route 9,L475563,u7324,BOOTH,I should have known something like this was going to happen!
162164,m495,route 9,L475562,u7328,EARL,It's the stupid thing to do that's what it is.
162165,m495,route 9,L475561,u7324,BOOTH,It's the right thing to do.
162166,m495,route 9,L475560,u7328,EARL,Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that you understand?  No way.
162167,m495,route 9,L475559,u7324,BOOTH,We gotta turn ourselves in before they hear the tape.
162168,m495,route 9,L475558,u7324,BOOTH,Oh right with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
162169,m495,route 9,L475557,u7328,EARL,No we didn't.  He died on his own.
162170,m495,route 9,L475556,u7324,BOOTH,We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
162171,m495,route 9,L475555,u7328,EARL,Well we didn't know that at the time.
162172,m495,route 9,L475554,u7324,BOOTH,That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law just like us.
162173,m495,route 9,L475553,u7328,EARL,I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
162174,m495,route 9,L475552,u7324,BOOTH,This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
162175,m495,route 9,L475551,u7328,EARL,I don't know...
162176,m495,route 9,L475550,u7324,BOOTH,We're dead.  We're dead We are dead...  What are we going to do?!
162177,m495,route 9,L475494,u7328,EARL,Fair enough I'll take it to my place.
162178,m495,route 9,L475493,u7324,BOOTH,Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
162179,m495,route 9,L475492,u7328,EARL,Well we didn't kill him he died on his own.
162180,m495,route 9,L475491,u7324,BOOTH,I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
162181,m495,route 9,L475490,u7328,EARL,I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
162182,m495,route 9,L475451,u7328,EARL,Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
162183,m495,route 9,L475450,u7324,BOOTH,That's not what I mean.
162184,m495,route 9,L475449,u7328,EARL,Okay then.  I'll do it.
162185,m495,route 9,L475448,u7324,BOOTH,I...I can't do that.
162186,m495,route 9,L475447,u7328,EARL,Well neither have I but it's us or him.  If he talks or writes a note or whatever he's gonna turn us in.  Besides he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
162187,m495,route 9,L475446,u7324,BOOTH,You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
162188,m495,route 9,L475445,u7328,EARL,I don't know...
162189,m495,route 9,L475444,u7324,BOOTH,What are you thinking?
162190,m495,route 9,L475443,u7328,EARL,I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
162191,m495,route 9,L475438,u7324,BOOTH,He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
162192,m495,route 9,L475437,u7328,EARL,How long you been lying there playing possum with us huh? Answer me!
162193,m495,route 9,L475436,u7324,BOOTH,He saw everything!
162194,m495,route 9,L475435,u7328,EARL,I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
162195,m495,route 9,L475430,u7324,BOOTH,Well I don't know.  I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
162196,m495,route 9,L475429,u7328,EARL,What are you gonna do?
162197,m495,route 9,L475428,u7324,BOOTH,Shhh!
162198,m495,route 9,L475414,u7328,EARL,Well we won't do any of that shit!
162199,m495,route 9,L475413,u7324,BOOTH,We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around buying fancy cars and fancy clothes people are going to ask questions.
162200,m495,route 9,L475412,u7328,EARL,What's that?
162201,m495,route 9,L475411,u7324,BOOTH,I've got one condition.
162202,m495,route 9,L475408,u7324,BOOTH,I don't know.
162203,m495,route 9,L475407,u7328,EARL,We'll leave a few packets in the trunk and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.
162204,m495,route 9,L475406,u7324,BOOTH,Torch it?!
162205,m495,route 9,L475405,u7328,EARL,We'll torch the bases how's that?
162206,m495,route 9,L475403,u7328,EARL,All right we will.
162207,m495,route 9,L475402,u7324,BOOTH,I do.  It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
162208,m495,route 9,L475401,u7328,EARL,Maybe.  Who cares?
162209,m495,route 9,L475400,u7324,BOOTH,All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit did you touch the car?
162210,m495,route 9,L475398,u7328,EARL,They killed themselves.  Besides they were breaking the law.  What they were doing was wrong!  Whatsamatter Booth don't you believe in miracles?

162386,m495,route 9,L475504,u7333,SALLY,It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there acting all official.
162387,m495,route 9,L475503,u7324,BOOTH,Yeah.
162388,m495,route 9,L475502,u7333,SALLY,Heard you had quite a night.
162389,m495,route 9,L475501,u7324,BOOTH,Hi.
162390,m495,route 9,L475500,u7333,SALLY,Hi.
162391,m495,route 9,L475289,u7324,BOOTH,I might have to look into that...
162392,m495,route 9,L475288,u7333,SALLY,Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
162393,m495,route 9,L475286,u7324,BOOTH,No.  But he would probably.
162394,m495,route 9,L475285,u7333,SALLY,Has he?
162395,m495,route 9,L475284,u7324,BOOTH,Ah hell he'd do the same for me.
162396,m495,route 9,L475283,u7333,SALLY,He's irresponsible.
162397,m495,route 9,L475282,u7324,BOOTH,Well not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.
162398,m495,route 9,L475280,u7324,BOOTH,Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
162399,m495,route 9,L475279,u7333,SALLY,There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
162400,m495,route 9,L475278,u7324,BOOTH,I gotta take some money out that's what for.
162401,m495,route 9,L475277,u7333,SALLY,What for?
162402,m495,route 9,L475276,u7324,BOOTH,I have to go to the bank before it closes.
162425,m495,route 9,L475828,u7328,EARL,Hell I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up.
162426,m495,route 9,L475827,u7327,DWAYNE,What do you think about all this?
162427,m495,route 9,L475569,u7327,DWAYNE,This just might be our ticket!
162428,m495,route 9,L475568,u7328,EARL,I don't know.
162429,m495,route 9,L475529,u7327,DWAYNE,We had hounds down at the scene the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
162430,m495,route 9,L475528,u7328,EARL,What makes you say that?
162431,m495,route 9,L475487,u7327,DWAYNE,Cause we got footprints leading into that brush I want to see where it leads...  Jesus seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
162432,m495,route 9,L475486,u7328,EARL,Why?
162433,m495,route 9,L475320,u7327,DWAYNE,Speaking of which that reminds me I have to bring something home or eat Sally's meatloaf again and I don't think I could stand that.
162434,m495,route 9,L475319,u7328,EARL,Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
162435,m495,route 9,L475318,u7327,DWAYNE,All right deputies take care don't let your meat loaf.
162436,m495,route 9,L475905,u7327,DWAYNE,Did you say After Midnight?
162438,m495,route 9,L475901,u7327,DWAYNE,Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
162439,m495,route 9,L475899,u7327,DWAYNE,Dwayne.
162441,m495,route 9,L475897,u7327,DWAYNE,Well yes I understand that we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
162443,m495,route 9,L475895,u7327,DWAYNE,Have you known this all along?
162446,m495,route 9,L475841,u7327,DWAYNE,Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
162448,m495,route 9,L475839,u7327,DWAYNE,Maybe I should come along.
162451,m495,route 9,L475818,u7327,DWAYNE,Why would someone do that?
162453,m495,route 9,L475816,u7327,DWAYNE,What are you getting at?
162455,m495,route 9,L475810,u7327,DWAYNE,Don't you think I would have told you that!
162458,m495,route 9,L475578,u7327,DWAYNE,Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together as law enforcement officers.
162459,m495,route 9,L475575,u7327,DWAYNE,Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin clearly relieved --
162461,m495,route 9,L475546,u7327,DWAYNE,Excellent. I'll go down with you.
162463,m495,route 9,L475544,u7327,DWAYNE,That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
162466,m495,route 9,L475520,u7327,DWAYNE,I guess we can get started.
162467,m495,route 9,L475911,u7327,DWAYNE,Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
162469,m495,route 9,L475909,u7327,DWAYNE,Lingerie...
162471,m495,route 9,L475907,u7327,DWAYNE,What the hell is that some kind of porno store or something?
162473,m495,route 9,L475893,u7327,DWAYNE,So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
162475,m495,route 9,L475891,u7327,DWAYNE,Is this marked money or what?
162478,m495,route 9,L476040,u7327,DWAYNE,A lot of men come in here?
162480,m495,route 9,L476038,u7327,DWAYNE,I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
162482,m495,route 9,L476036,u7327,DWAYNE,Well...I should have done a little homework getting all the sizes and what not.
162483,m495,route 9,L476035,u7327,DWAYNE,No I don't.  You sure you havent seen her?
162485,m495,route 9,L476033,u7327,DWAYNE,Yeah I'd say C...C.
162487,m495,route 9,L476031,u7327,DWAYNE,Uh...C?
162489,m495,route 9,L476029,u7327,DWAYNE,Oh.

162493,m495,route 9,L476025,u7327,DWAYNE,I don't suppose you've seen her.
162495,m495,route 9,L476023,u7327,DWAYNE,Yeah she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
162497,m495,route 9,L476017,u7327,DWAYNE,Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
162498,m495,route 9,L476014,u7327,DWAYNE,Well I don't know...
162500,m495,route 9,L476012,u7327,DWAYNE,I have an anniversary coming up thought I'd buy her something special.
162501,m495,route 9,L476011,u7327,DWAYNE,Well I just uh you know...
162503,m495,route 9,L476009,u7327,DWAYNE,Hi.
162505,m495,route 9,L475826,u7330,JESSE,Well I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
162506,m495,route 9,L475825,u7327,DWAYNE,You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
162507,m495,route 9,L475824,u7330,JESSE,No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
162508,m495,route 9,L475823,u7327,DWAYNE,Something wrong Jesse?
162509,m495,route 9,L475805,u7330,JESSE,Well I'm here now.
162510,m495,route 9,L475804,u7327,DWAYNE,Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock didn't I?
162511,m495,route 9,L475763,u7330,JESSE,Yeah...see you at three.
162512,m495,route 9,L475762,u7327,DWAYNE,I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
162513,m495,route 9,L475761,u7330,JESSE,I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.

162516,m495,route 9,L475758,u7327,DWAYNE,Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone but they did ask for you and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
162517,m495,route 9,L475757,u7330,JESSE,About what?
162518,m495,route 9,L475756,u7327,DWAYNE,Well we got the DEA coming down here again I don't know sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
162519,m495,route 9,L475755,u7330,JESSE,Why?
162520,m495,route 9,L475754,u7327,DWAYNE,Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
162521,m495,route 9,L475753,u7330,JESSE,I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
162522,m495,route 9,L475752,u7330,JESSE,Yeah whaddya want?.
162523,m495,route 9,L475751,u7327,DWAYNE,Jesse?
162524,m495,route 9,L475316,u7330,JESSE,Yeah.  That's all I need to become one of your in-laws.
162525,m495,route 9,L475315,u7327,DWAYNE,She's not his type.
162526,m495,route 9,L475312,u7330,JESSE,Sort of.
162527,m495,route 9,L475311,u7327,DWAYNE,Do you even have a girlfriend Jesse?
162528,m495,route 9,L475304,u7327,DWAYNE,Take it or leave it.
162529,m495,route 9,L475303,u7330,JESSE,Aw now thats gonna take time to clear!
162530,m495,route 9,L475302,u7327,DWAYNE,Dammit youre persistent.  I dont want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
162531,m495,route 9,L475301,u7330,JESSE,No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me and Im a busy man.
162532,m495,route 9,L475300,u7327,DWAYNE,All right youre the super sleuth what do you want a medal?
162533,m495,route 9,L475299,u7330,JESSE,Very clumsy very clumsy.  Id have found it in a minute.
162534,m495,route 9,L475297,u7327,DWAYNE,He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow no drugs in her system no foul play.
162535,m495,route 9,L475296,u7330,JESSE,Damn its hot in here...
162536,m495,route 9,L475295,u7330,JESSE,I mean at least pick a more discreet place the scalp under the armpit under the tongue someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look.
162537,m495,route 9,L475294,u7327,DWAYNE,Just goes to show you.
162538,m495,route 9,L476129,u7327,DWAYNE,Calm down --

162544,m495,route 9,L476115,u7333,SALLY,Dwayne put the gun down --
162545,m495,route 9,L476114,u7327,DWAYNE,You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
162546,m495,route 9,L475930,u7333,SALLY,It certainly is...

162555,m495,route 9,L475919,u7327,DWAYNE,Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
162556,m495,route 9,L475918,u7333,SALLY,I didn't say that.  You did.
162557,m495,route 9,L475917,u7327,DWAYNE,Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
162558,m495,route 9,L475915,u7333,SALLY,That hasn't stopped you before.
162559,m495,route 9,L475914,u7327,DWAYNE,Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
162560,m495,route 9,L475913,u7327,DWAYNE,Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?

162562,m495,route 9,L475699,u7333,SALLY,I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
162563,m495,route 9,L475698,u7327,DWAYNE,What are you saying?
162564,m495,route 9,L475696,u7327,DWAYNE,A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
162565,m495,route 9,L475695,u7333,SALLY,It was going to be a surprise!
162566,m495,route 9,L475688,u7327,DWAYNE,Forget it.
162567,m495,route 9,L475687,u7333,SALLY,I can't hear a word you're saying!
162568,m495,route 9,L475686,u7327,DWAYNE,Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?

162573,m495,route 9,L475969,u7330,JESSE,Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
162574,m495,route 9,L475968,u7328,EARL,Easy to purchase hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
162575,m495,route 9,L475967,u7328,EARL,We gotta Jesse.  It's tough but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.
162576,m495,route 9,L475966,u7330,JESSE,Don't hurt me.
162577,m495,route 9,L475945,u7330,JESSE,Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
162578,m495,route 9,L475944,u7328,EARL,I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
162579,m495,route 9,L475943,u7328,EARL,We're gonna talk.
162580,m495,route 9,L475942,u7330,JESSE,What the hell are you doing you crazy some bitches --
162581,m495,route 9,L475873,u7330,JESSE,I think I am.
162582,m495,route 9,L475872,u7328,EARL,You're never getting that much.
162583,m495,route 9,L475871,u7330,JESSE,You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.
162584,m495,route 9,L475867,u7328,EARL,Well you can't have it.

162587,m495,route 9,L475864,u7330,JESSE,I was on a roll!  Im a little overextended now.
162588,m495,route 9,L475863,u7328,EARL,What do you mean?  You gambled it?
162589,m495,route 9,L475857,u7330,JESSE,Listen -
162590,m495,route 9,L475856,u7328,EARL,Well you're not getting either.
162591,m495,route 9,L475855,u7330,JESSE,I'm not asking.
162592,m495,route 9,L475850,u7330,JESSE,Just do it!  Meet me there now.
162593,m495,route 9,L475849,u7328,EARL,What?
162594,m495,route 9,L475848,u7330,JESSE,Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
162595,m495,route 9,L475836,u7330,JESSE,Right behind you.
162596,m495,route 9,L475835,u7328,EARL,We're out of here.
162597,m495,route 9,L475664,u7330,JESSE,True but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse wouldn't you Earl?
162598,m495,route 9,L475663,u7328,EARL,And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor did you ever consider that?
162599,m495,route 9,L475662,u7330,JESSE,I'll settle for a third of that.
162600,m495,route 9,L475656,u7328,EARL,Then what the hell are you all about?
162601,m495,route 9,L475655,u7330,JESSE,Hey we're all friends right? Friends don't squeal on friends that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
162602,m495,route 9,L475800,u7328,EARL,Absolutely positively.
162604,m495,route 9,L475796,u7328,EARL,You've done without it long enough ma.
162606,m495,route 9,L475794,u7328,EARL,Ah hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides I want you to have it.
162608,m495,route 9,L475792,u7328,EARL,Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
162610,m495,route 9,L475790,u7328,EARL,Yep fifteen thousand BTU's enough to cool off this whole place.
162612,m495,route 9,L475788,u7328,EARL,And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
162614,m495,route 9,L475785,u7328,EARL,Well basically I forgot about it you know you never win these things but this time well...
162616,m495,route 9,L475783,u7328,EARL,There was this raffle going on at the station some charity or church was running it I forget so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
162618,m495,route 9,L475779,u7328,EARL,Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
162620,m495,route 9,L475777,u7328,EARL,At least around here it does.
162622,m495,route 9,L475775,u7328,EARL,Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID and if you do you're a damn fool.
162624,m495,route 9,L475773,u7328,EARL,It was pretty gory ma let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off and do your job just like pop used to say.
162626,m495,route 9,L475771,u7328,EARL,Well same ol' same ol'.
162628,m495,route 9,L475769,u7328,EARL,Yeah.
162630,m495,route 9,L475767,u7328,EARL,I was in the neighborhood.
162633,m495,route 9,L475764,u7328,EARL,Hi ma.
165974,m507,scream,L487514,u7516,STU,I can't... I'm bad off Billy. You cut too deep.
165975,m507,scream,L487513,u7502,BILLY,FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
165976,m507,scream,L487507,u7502,BILLY,Where the fuck did she go?
165977,m507,scream,L487506,u7516,STU,I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
165978,m507,scream,L487503,u7516,STU,Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
165979,m507,scream,L487502,u7502,BILLY,She can't get both of us.
165980,m507,scream,L487499,u7516,STU,She looked dead. Still does.
165981,m507,scream,L487498,u7502,BILLY,I thought she was dead.
165982,m507,scream,L487495,u7516,STU,No it's not.
165983,m507,scream,L487494,u7502,BILLY,It's on the table.
165984,m507,scream,L487492,u7502,BILLY,Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
165985,m507,scream,L487491,u7516,STU,That's it Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
165986,m507,scream,L487488,u7516,STU,Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
165987,m507,scream,L487487,u7502,BILLY,And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
165988,m507,scream,L487486,u7516,STU,Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
165989,m507,scream,L487485,u7502,BILLY,What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree killing everyone...
165990,m507,scream,L487477,u7516,STU,Yeah...
165991,m507,scream,L487476,u7502,BILLY,Ready?
165992,m507,scream,L487475,u7502,BILLY,You know what time it is Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
165993,m507,scream,L487474,u7516,STU,This is the best part Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
165994,m507,scream,L487472,u7516,STU,That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
165995,m507,scream,L487471,u7502,BILLY,Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years don't you think?. You took my mother so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
165996,m507,scream,L487465,u7502,BILLY,And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see it's scarier when there's no motive Sid.
165997,m507,scream,L487464,u7516,STU,Nope.
165998,m507,scream,L487461,u7516,STU,Yeah we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
165999,m507,scream,L487460,u7502,BILLY,Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
166000,m507,scream,L487456,u7516,STU,And if you get it right -- you die.
166001,m507,scream,L487455,u7502,BILLY,It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
166002,m507,scream,L487454,u7516,STU,You have to play Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
166003,m507,scream,L487444,u7516,STU,Oh yeah.
166004,m507,scream,L487443,u7502,BILLY,Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu I believe it's your turn.
166005,m507,scream,L487307,u7502,BILLY,I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
166006,m507,scream,L487306,u7516,STU,Dude. What are you doing here?
166007,m507,scream,L487165,u7516,STU,You know it.
166008,m507,scream,L487164,u7502,BILLY,You ready to party hard tonight?
166009,m507,scream,L487163,u7516,STU,Oh...
166010,m507,scream,L487162,u7502,BILLY,Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
166011,m507,scream,L487161,u7516,STU,I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
166012,m507,scream,L487160,u7502,BILLY,Duh... that's quick.
166013,m507,scream,L487159,u7516,STU,So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
166014,m507,scream,L487158,u7502,BILLY,Thanks butt wart. You did good.
166015,m507,scream,L487157,u7516,STU,Piece of cake. She'll be there.
166016,m507,scream,L487156,u7502,BILLY,How'd you do?
166017,m507,scream,L487050,u7516,STU,Sorry.
166018,m507,scream,L487049,u7502,BILLY,You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
166019,m507,scream,L487048,u7516,STU,Owwww...
166020,m507,scream,L486805,u7502,BILLY,No one's saying you did.
166021,m507,scream,L486804,u7516,STU,I didn't kill anybody.
166022,m507,scream,L486787,u7516,STU,Sorry.
166023,m507,scream,L486786,u7502,BILLY,It's called tact you fuckrag.
166024,m507,scream,L486785,u7516,STU,What? She asked.
166026,m507,scream,L486919,u7502,BILLY,No I didn't. I didn't kill anyone Sheriff.
166029,m507,scream,L486914,u7502,BILLY,Yes sir.
166031,m507,scream,L486912,u7502,BILLY,I just wanted to see her that's all.
166033,m507,scream,L487518,u7515,SIDNEY,Gotta find me first you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
166034,m507,scream,L487517,u7502,BILLY,I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
166035,m507,scream,L487511,u7515,SIDNEY,Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
166036,m507,scream,L487510,u7502,BILLY,You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
166037,m507,scream,L487509,u7515,SIDNEY,Are you alone in the house?
166038,m507,scream,L487508,u7502,BILLY,Hello?
166039,m507,scream,L487483,u7502,BILLY,Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
166040,m507,scream,L487482,u7515,SIDNEY,Stop it!
166041,m507,scream,L487481,u7502,BILLY,Jesus... fuck that hurt.
166042,m507,scream,L487467,u7502,BILLY,We did your mom a favor Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
166043,m507,scream,L487466,u7515,SIDNEY,I don't understand...
166044,m507,scream,L487463,u7502,BILLY,Why? WHY? Did you hear that Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives Sid. I mean did Norman Bates have a motive?
166045,m507,scream,L487462,u7515,SIDNEY,Why did you kill my mother?
166046,m507,scream,L487453,u7502,BILLY,We already played that game. You lost remember?
166047,m507,scream,L487452,u7515,SIDNEY,Fuck you.
166048,m507,scream,L487451,u7502,BILLY,It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
166049,m507,scream,L487434,u7502,BILLY,It's okay. Give me the gun.
166050,m507,scream,L487433,u7515,SIDNEY,NO! Don't believe him.
166051,m507,scream,L487430,u7502,BILLY,I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
166052,m507,scream,L487429,u7515,SIDNEY,I thought you were...
166053,m507,scream,L487379,u7515,SIDNEY,No but if it were you that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
166054,m507,scream,L487378,u7502,BILLY,You don't still think it was me?
166055,m507,scream,L487377,u7515,SIDNEY,Uh-huh.
166056,m507,scream,L487376,u7502,BILLY,Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
166057,m507,scream,L487375,u7515,SIDNEY,No Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
166058,m507,scream,L487374,u7502,BILLY,I called my dad.
166059,m507,scream,L487373,u7515,SIDNEY,When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
166060,m507,scream,L487372,u7502,BILLY,What?
166061,m507,scream,L487371,u7515,SIDNEY,Who did you call?
166062,m507,scream,L487337,u7515,SIDNEY,Yeah... I think so.
166063,m507,scream,L487336,u7502,BILLY,Are you serious?
166064,m507,scream,L487335,u7515,SIDNEY,You heard me.
166065,m507,scream,L487334,u7502,BILLY,What?
166066,m507,scream,L487333,u7515,SIDNEY,Or even a good porno.
166067,m507,scream,L487332,u7502,BILLY,Sshh... it's okay.
166068,m507,scream,L487330,u7502,BILLY,Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
166069,m507,scream,L487329,u7515,SIDNEY,I wanna let go. I do...
166070,m507,scream,L487328,u7502,BILLY,Sure it is Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
166071,m507,scream,L487327,u7515,SIDNEY,But this is life. This isn't a movie.
166072,m507,scream,L487326,u7502,BILLY,Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
166073,m507,scream,L487325,u7515,SIDNEY,Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
166074,m507,scream,L487324,u7502,BILLY,Oh Sidney...
166075,m507,scream,L487323,u7515,SIDNEY,I think in some weird analytical psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her you know? Like the bad seed or something...
166076,m507,scream,L487322,u7515,SIDNEY,But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
166077,m507,scream,L487321,u7502,BILLY,You lost your mom...
166078,m507,scream,L487320,u7515,SIDNEY,No Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
166079,m507,scream,L487319,u7502,BILLY,So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
166080,m507,scream,L487318,u7515,SIDNEY,So...
166081,m507,scream,L487311,u7515,SIDNEY,It's okay. We need to talk.
166082,m507,scream,L487310,u7502,BILLY,Subtlety Stu. Look it up.
166083,m507,scream,L487070,u7502,BILLY,You have to move on Sid.
166084,m507,scream,L487069,u7515,SIDNEY,Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town she's not in a coffin somewhere.
166085,m507,scream,L487068,u7502,BILLY,When are you gonna let that go Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
166086,m507,scream,L487067,u7515,SIDNEY,Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
166087,m507,scream,L487066,u7502,BILLY,It's been a year since she died.
166088,m507,scream,L487065,u7515,SIDNEY,No it's me Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
166089,m507,scream,L487064,u7502,BILLY,Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
166090,m507,scream,L487063,u7515,SIDNEY,No...
166091,m507,scream,L487062,u7502,BILLY,Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
166092,m507,scream,L487061,u7515,SIDNEY,You know that's not true.
166093,m507,scream,L487060,u7502,BILLY,Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
166094,m507,scream,L487059,u7515,SIDNEY,I'm so sorry... please understand.
166095,m507,scream,L487058,u7502,BILLY,See it couldn't have been me. I was in jail remember?
166096,m507,scream,L487057,u7515,SIDNEY,I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
166097,m507,scream,L487056,u7502,BILLY,The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me Sid.
166098,m507,scream,L487055,u7515,SIDNEY,No... I don't... it's just... Oh God Billy someone was there someone tried to kill me.
166099,m507,scream,L487053,u7502,BILLY,Hey hey it's just me.
166100,m507,scream,L487052,u7515,SIDNEY,Jesus SHIT!
166101,m507,scream,L486865,u7515,SIDNEY,He's here. He's trying to kill me...
166102,m507,scream,L486864,u7502,BILLY,I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
166103,m507,scream,L486863,u7515,SIDNEY,Oh Billy... Please... God...
166104,m507,scream,L486741,u7502,BILLY,What's that?
166105,m507,scream,L486740,u7515,SIDNEY,Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
166106,m507,scream,L486737,u7502,BILLY,I'm going... I'm going.
166107,m507,scream,L486736,u7515,SIDNEY,You know what my dad will do to you?
166108,m507,scream,L486733,u7502,BILLY,No no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
166109,m507,scream,L486732,u7515,SIDNEY,So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
166110,m507,scream,L486730,u7515,SIDNEY,Oh it did?
166111,m507,scream,L486729,u7502,BILLY,And I was home bored watching television THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
166112,m507,scream,L486728,u7515,SIDNEY,Now that it's out of your system.
166113,m507,scream,L486727,u7502,BILLY,It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
166114,m507,scream,L486726,u7515,SIDNEY,What are you doing here?
166115,m507,scream,L486725,u7502,BILLY,Close call.
166116,m507,scream,L486712,u7502,BILLY,I'll only stay a sec.
166117,m507,scream,L486711,u7515,SIDNEY,My dad's in the other room.
166118,m507,scream,L486710,u7502,BILLY,You sleep in THAT?
166119,m507,scream,L486709,u7515,SIDNEY,What are you doing here?
166120,m507,scream,L486708,u7502,BILLY,I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
166121,m507,scream,L486707,u7515,SIDNEY,Billy? What the...
166122,m507,scream,L486688,u7510,MAN,Your call.
166123,m507,scream,L486687,u7503,CASEY,Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
166124,m507,scream,L486686,u7510,MAN,There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live.
166125,m507,scream,L486685,u7503,CASEY,What?
166126,m507,scream,L486684,u7510,MAN,What door am I at?
166127,m507,scream,L486683,u7510,MAN,Answer the question and I will.
166128,m507,scream,L486682,u7503,CASEY,...leave me alone... please...
166129,m507,scream,L486680,u7510,MAN,Lucky for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
166130,m507,scream,L486679,u7503,CASEY,You tricked me...
166131,m507,scream,L486678,u7510,MAN,Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
166132,m507,scream,L486677,u7503,CASEY,It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
166133,m507,scream,L486676,u7510,MAN,Afraid not.
166134,m507,scream,L486675,u7503,CASEY,No it's not. It was Jason.
166135,m507,scream,L486674,u7510,MAN,I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
166136,m507,scream,L486672,u7510,MAN,Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
166137,m507,scream,L486671,u7503,CASEY,...please... no...
166138,m507,scream,L486670,u7510,MAN,Then answer the question. Same category.
166139,m507,scream,L486669,u7503,CASEY,Please go away! Leave us alone!
166140,m507,scream,L486668,u7510,MAN,But you're doing so well.
166141,m507,scream,L486667,u7503,CASEY,NOOOO....

166361,m507,scream,L487208,u7504,DEWEY,Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
166363,m507,scream,L487206,u7504,DEWEY,Keeping my eye on Sidney.
166365,m507,scream,L487099,u7504,DEWEY,Yes sir sheriff.
166367,m507,scream,L486929,u7504,DEWEY,We haven't located her Dad yet.
166370,m507,scream,L486924,u7504,DEWEY,They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
166372,m507,scream,L486922,u7504,DEWEY,That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
166374,m507,scream,L486876,u7504,DEWEY,She's tough.
166376,m507,scream,L486874,u7504,DEWEY,Drive by patrol.
166378,m507,scream,L486872,u7504,DEWEY,I was first to respond.
166379,m507,scream,L486870,u7504,DEWEY,He's her boyfriend.
166381,m507,scream,L486868,u7504,DEWEY,We got him Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
166383,m507,scream,L486767,u7504,DEWEY,It's Deputy Riley today Sid.
166413,m507,scream,L487014,u7515,SIDNEY,I saw him leaving wearing it.
166415,m507,scream,L487012,u7515,SIDNEY,He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
166417,m507,scream,L487010,u7515,SIDNEY,Has his story changed?
166419,m507,scream,L487008,u7515,SIDNEY,Have you talked to Cotton?
166421,m507,scream,L487006,u7515,SIDNEY,During the trial you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
166423,m507,scream,L487004,u7515,SIDNEY,Do you still think he's innocent?
166425,m507,scream,L487002,u7515,SIDNEY,And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
166427,m507,scream,L487000,u7515,SIDNEY,You owe my mother.
166429,m507,scream,L486998,u7515,SIDNEY,Please. You owe me.
166431,m507,scream,L486996,u7515,SIDNEY,Off the record. No cameras.
166433,m507,scream,L486994,u7515,SIDNEY,I want to talk to you.
166435,m507,scream,L486992,u7515,SIDNEY,I'm not here to fight.
166437,m507,scream,L486943,u7515,SIDNEY,I'll look for it.
166439,m507,scream,L486941,u7515,SIDNEY,How's the book?
166441,m507,scream,L486939,u7515,SIDNEY,It's okay Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right GALE?
166456,m507,scream,L486970,u7515,SIDNEY,Who are you?
166457,m507,scream,L486969,u7510,MAN,Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
166458,m507,scream,L486968,u7515,SIDNEY,LEAVEMEALONE!
166459,m507,scream,L486967,u7510,MAN,Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
166460,m507,scream,L486965,u7510,MAN,Hello Sidney.
166461,m507,scream,L486964,u7515,SIDNEY,Hello?
166462,m507,scream,L486858,u7510,MAN,If you hang up you'll die just like your mother.
166463,m507,scream,L486857,u7515,SIDNEY,Good try Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
166464,m507,scream,L486856,u7515,SIDNEY,What am I doing?
166465,m507,scream,L486855,u7510,MAN,Uh-huh.
166466,m507,scream,L486854,u7515,SIDNEY,Can you see me right now?
166467,m507,scream,L486853,u7510,MAN,Right here.
166468,m507,scream,L486852,u7515,SIDNEY,So where are you?
166469,m507,scream,L486850,u7510,MAN,That's the original part.
166470,m507,scream,L486849,u7515,SIDNEY,Why would you call me from my front porch?
166471,m507,scream,L486848,u7510,MAN,Your front porch.
166472,m507,scream,L486847,u7515,SIDNEY,So where are you?
166473,m507,scream,L486846,u7510,MAN,The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
166474,m507,scream,L486845,u7515,SIDNEY,So who are you?
166475,m507,scream,L486844,u7510,MAN,Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
166476,m507,scream,L486843,u7515,SIDNEY,That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me Randy.
166477,m507,scream,L486842,u7510,MAN,Are you alone in the house?
166478,m507,scream,L486841,u7515,SIDNEY,Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
166479,m507,scream,L486840,u7510,MAN,And why is that?
166480,m507,scream,L486839,u7515,SIDNEY,Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
166481,m507,scream,L486838,u7510,MAN,What's your favorite scary movie?
166482,m507,scream,L486837,u7515,SIDNEY,I like that thing you're doing with your voice Randy. It's sexy.
166483,m507,scream,L486836,u7510,MAN,Do you like scary movies Sidney?
166484,m507,scream,L486835,u7515,SIDNEY,Aha Randy you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
166485,m507,scream,L486834,u7510,MAN,Scary night isn't it? With the murders and all it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
166486,m507,scream,L486833,u7515,SIDNEY,I have no idea.
166488,m507,scream,L486723,u7515,SIDNEY,Have a good trip.
166489,m507,scream,L486721,u7515,SIDNEY,Got it.
166491,m507,scream,L486719,u7515,SIDNEY,...out at the airport...
166493,m507,scream,L486717,u7515,SIDNEY,No you didn't.
166495,m507,scream,L486715,u7515,SIDNEY,Can you knock?
166498,m507,scream,L486802,u7517,TATUM,I thought Blockbuster fired you.
166500,m507,scream,L486800,u7517,TATUM,Fuck you nut case. Where were you last night?
166502,m507,scream,L486798,u7517,TATUM,Stu was with me last night.
166504,m507,scream,L487529,u7515,SIDNEY,Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
166506,m507,scream,L487413,u7515,SIDNEY,Don't come any closer.
166508,m507,scream,L487411,u7515,SIDNEY,Stop. Right there.
166510,m507,scream,L487264,u7515,SIDNEY,THE FOG TERROR TRAIN PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
166512,m507,scream,L487420,u7516,STU,Come on Sid. Give me the gun.
166514,m507,scream,L487418,u7516,STU,His movie nut mind has snapped Sid. He's gone psycho.
166515,m507,scream,L487352,u7516,STU,I'll be right back.
166517,m507,scream,L487350,u7516,STU,Wanna another beer?
166519,m507,scream,L487344,u7516,STU,I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
166520,m507,scream,L487315,u7516,STU,Like you had one.
166522,m507,scream,L487313,u7516,STU,He came to make up.
166524,m507,scream,L487281,u7516,STU,I can cry on cue.
166527,m507,scream,L487262,u7516,STU,I thought everything was checked out.
166529,m507,scream,L487190,u7516,STU,And what would be your motive?
166532,m507,scream,L487184,u7516,STU,Which is you...
166534,m507,scream,L487182,u7516,STU,I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
166536,m507,scream,L487180,u7516,STU,She's saving herself for you.
166538,m507,scream,L487178,u7516,STU,So what's his reason?
166540,m507,scream,L487176,u7516,STU,Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
166542,m507,scream,L487174,u7516,STU,The why'd the police let him go?
166544,m507,scream,L487172,u7516,STU,It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
166546,m507,scream,L487170,u7516,STU,What?
166548,m507,scream,L487168,u7516,STU,You coming tonight?
166550,m507,scream,L487166,u7516,STU,Jesus this place is packed.
166552,m507,scream,L486807,u7516,STU,I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
166554,m507,scream,L486796,u7516,STU,What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
166557,m507,scream,L486791,u7516,STU,For about two seconds.
166558,m507,scream,L486781,u7516,STU,Yeah Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
166560,m507,scream,L487516,u7516,STU,Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
166561,m507,scream,L487515,u7515,SIDNEY,So Stu what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
166562,m507,scream,L487459,u7515,SIDNEY,You'll never get away with this.
166563,m507,scream,L487457,u7515,SIDNEY,You're crazy -- both of you.
166564,m507,scream,L487450,u7516,STU,It's all part of the game.
166565,m507,scream,L487449,u7515,SIDNEY,Why are you doing this?
166566,m507,scream,L487448,u7516,STU,Guess I won't be needing this anymore.
166567,m507,scream,L487309,u7516,STU,You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
166568,m507,scream,L487308,u7515,SIDNEY,If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
166569,m507,scream,L487139,u7516,STU,Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
166570,m507,scream,L487138,u7515,SIDNEY,Yeah okay... whatever.
166571,m507,scream,L487137,u7516,STU,Remember there's safety in numbers.
166572,m507,scream,L487133,u7516,STU,My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us hangin'.
166573,m507,scream,L487132,u7515,SIDNEY,Are you serious?
166574,m507,scream,L487131,u7516,STU,And to celebrate this impromptu fall break I propose we have a party. Tonight my house.
166575,m507,scream,L487047,u7516,STU,Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
166576,m507,scream,L487046,u7515,SIDNEY,Why are they doing this?
166577,m507,scream,L486790,u7515,SIDNEY,Hey Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
166578,m507,scream,L486789,u7516,STU,You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
166579,m507,scream,L487236,u7515,SIDNEY,Deal.
166580,m507,scream,L487235,u7517,TATUM,There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh Sid let's have some fun tonight.
166581,m507,scream,L487234,u7517,TATUM,Oh Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
166582,m507,scream,L487233,u7515,SIDNEY,TATUM!
166583,m507,scream,L487232,u7517,TATUM,Watch the show Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
166584,m507,scream,L487231,u7515,SIDNEY,What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
166585,m507,scream,L487229,u7515,SIDNEY,No way.
166586,m507,scream,L487227,u7515,SIDNEY,How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
166587,m507,scream,L487225,u7515,SIDNEY,Who?
166588,m507,scream,L487224,u7517,TATUM,With Stu there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before to relax and get in the mood I think about Grant Goodeve.
166589,m507,scream,L487223,u7515,SIDNEY,What do you think about when you're having sex?
166590,m507,scream,L487222,u7517,TATUM,Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
166591,m507,scream,L487221,u7515,SIDNEY,But he's been so patient with me Tatum. You know with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
166592,m507,scream,L487220,u7517,TATUM,You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
166593,m507,scream,L487219,u7515,SIDNEY,Billy's right. Whenever he touches me I just can't relax.
166594,m507,scream,L487202,u7517,TATUM,He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
166595,m507,scream,L487201,u7515,SIDNEY,Is Billy going to be there tonight?
166596,m507,scream,L487197,u7515,SIDNEY,Oh god...
166597,m507,scream,L487196,u7517,TATUM,Hey Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
166598,m507,scream,L487155,u7517,TATUM,Come on let's rock.
166599,m507,scream,L487154,u7515,SIDNEY,You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
166600,m507,scream,L487153,u7517,TATUM,Don't go there Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
166601,m507,scream,L487152,u7515,SIDNEY,If I was wrong Cotton then he's still out there.
166602,m507,scream,L487151,u7517,TATUM,Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
166603,m507,scream,L487150,u7515,SIDNEY,And you believe it?
166604,m507,scream,L487149,u7517,TATUM,It goes further back Sid. There's been talk about other men.
166605,m507,scream,L487148,u7515,SIDNEY,Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
166606,m507,scream,L487147,u7517,TATUM,You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
166607,m507,scream,L487146,u7515,SIDNEY,If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
166608,m507,scream,L487145,u7517,TATUM,I didn't say that Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
166609,m507,scream,L487144,u7515,SIDNEY,So you think my mom was a slut too?
166610,m507,scream,L487143,u7517,TATUM,Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
166611,m507,scream,L487136,u7517,TATUM,Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
166612,m507,scream,L487135,u7515,SIDNEY,I don't know...
166613,m507,scream,L487134,u7517,TATUM,This could be good. What do you think Sid?
166614,m507,scream,L487126,u7515,SIDNEY,It was him Tatum. I know it.
166615,m507,scream,L487125,u7517,TATUM,It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
166616,m507,scream,L487041,u7517,TATUM,Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
166617,m507,scream,L487040,u7515,SIDNEY,I bet he's pissed.
166618,m507,scream,L487039,u7517,TATUM,Shit what is he doing here?
166619,m507,scream,L487038,u7517,TATUM,I want you to meet me here right after class okay?
166620,m507,scream,L487037,u7515,SIDNEY,This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
166621,m507,scream,L487032,u7515,SIDNEY,But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
166622,m507,scream,L487031,u7517,TATUM,Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
166623,m507,scream,L486990,u7515,SIDNEY,Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
166624,m507,scream,L486989,u7517,TATUM,Come on Sid.
166625,m507,scream,L486962,u7515,SIDNEY,It's alright. I'll get it.
166626,m507,scream,L486961,u7517,TATUM,Take a message.
166627,m507,scream,L486956,u7517,TATUM,I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.
166628,m507,scream,L486955,u7515,SIDNEY,He was there Tatum.
166629,m507,scream,L486954,u7517,TATUM,Do you really think Billy did it?
166630,m507,scream,L486953,u7515,SIDNEY,No nothing's like it used to be.
166631,m507,scream,L486952,u7517,TATUM,Just like old times ain't it?
166632,m507,scream,L486951,u7515,SIDNEY,Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
166633,m507,scream,L486886,u7517,TATUM,Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
166634,m507,scream,L486885,u7515,SIDNEY,It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
166635,m507,scream,L486828,u7517,TATUM,Bye.
166636,m507,scream,L486827,u7515,SIDNEY,Whatever. Just hurry.
166637,m507,scream,L486826,u7517,TATUM,Good 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
166638,m507,scream,L486825,u7515,SIDNEY,I'm not worried.
166639,m507,scream,L486824,u7517,TATUM,Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
166640,m507,scream,L486823,u7515,SIDNEY,It's past seven.
166641,m507,scream,L486822,u7517,TATUM,Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
166642,m507,scream,L486818,u7517,TATUM,Later.

166650,m507,scream,L486783,u7515,SIDNEY,How do you gut someone?
166651,m507,scream,L486782,u7517,TATUM,Or a man's mentality.
166652,m507,scream,L486756,u7517,TATUM,They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than...  Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
166653,m507,scream,L486755,u7515,SIDNEY,They think it's school-related?
166654,m507,scream,L486754,u7517,TATUM,Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers students staff janitors...
166655,m507,scream,L486753,u7515,SIDNEY,Do they know who did it?
166656,m507,scream,L486752,u7517,TATUM,Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
166657,m507,scream,L486751,u7515,SIDNEY,Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
166658,m507,scream,L486750,u7517,TATUM,And not just killed Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
166659,m507,scream,L486749,u7515,SIDNEY,No way.
166660,m507,scream,L486748,u7517,TATUM,Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
166661,m507,scream,L486747,u7515,SIDNEY,What happened?
166662,m507,scream,L486746,u7517,TATUM,Do you believe this shit?
166663,m507,scream,L487271,u7516,STU,Hey guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
166664,m507,scream,L487270,u7517,TATUM,What am I? The beer wench?
166665,m507,scream,L487269,u7516,STU,I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
166666,m507,scream,L487267,u7517,TATUM,Tits -- see.
166667,m507,scream,L487266,u7516,STU,With that set of lungs -- she should be.
166668,m507,scream,L487245,u7516,STU,Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
166669,m507,scream,L487244,u7517,TATUM,That's mature.
166670,m507,scream,L487130,u7516,STU,Okay but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
166671,m507,scream,L487129,u7517,TATUM,For once Stu drop it.
166672,m507,scream,L487128,u7516,STU,Is this not cool or what? Hey Sid what happened?
166673,m507,scream,L487044,u7516,STU,Hey go easy Tatum. He didn't do it.
166674,m507,scream,L487043,u7517,TATUM,You know if I were accused of carving up two people I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
166675,m507,scream,L486794,u7516,STU,I did. He's full of shit.
166676,m507,scream,L486793,u7517,TATUM,I thought you dumped her for me.
166677,m507,scream,L486779,u7517,TATUM,That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
166678,m507,scream,L486778,u7516,STU,Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
166679,m507,scream,L486774,u7516,STU,I don't know they just did.
166680,m507,scream,L486773,u7517,TATUM,Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
167832,m513,shampoo,L501325,u7588,GEORGE,Well it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
167834,m513,shampoo,L501323,u7588,GEORGE,She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
167836,m513,shampoo,L501321,u7588,GEORGE,No it's a very groovy girl.
167838,m513,shampoo,L501319,u7588,GEORGE,I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
167841,m513,shampoo,L501307,u7588,GEORGE,Look would you argue with your doctor?

167853,m513,shampoo,L501769,u7586,FELICIA,Lester you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
167854,m513,shampoo,L501768,u7597,LESTER,Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
167855,m513,shampoo,L501767,u7586,FELICIA,-- is that what this is all about?
167856,m513,shampoo,L501766,u7597,LESTER,-- yes we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in believe it or not.
167857,m513,shampoo,L501765,u7586,FELICIA,-- is that right?
167858,m513,shampoo,L501762,u7586,FELICIA,You make me sick. Just be straight for once in your life.
167859,m513,shampoo,L501761,u7597,LESTER,That's okay too.
167860,m513,shampoo,L501760,u7586,FELICIA,We cannot go into this later.
167861,m513,shampoo,L501758,u7597,LESTER,Can't we go into this later sweetheart?
167862,m513,shampoo,L501757,u7586,FELICIA,-- cause she's going to be very very expensive.

167867,m513,shampoo,L501709,u7597,LESTER,Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it goddammit --
167868,m513,shampoo,L501708,u7586,FELICIA,I just thought you'd like to know --
167869,m513,shampoo,L501707,u7597,LESTER,What do you expect me to do about it?
167870,m513,shampoo,L501706,u7586,FELICIA,That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
167871,m513,shampoo,L501705,u7586,FELICIA,Lester don't you think that uhh --
167872,m513,shampoo,L501704,u7597,LESTER,-- yes Senator -- just a minute dear --
167873,m513,shampoo,L501669,u7597,LESTER,It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
167874,m513,shampoo,L501668,u7586,FELICIA,That's George.
167875,m513,shampoo,L501292,u7597,LESTER,No doll I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right.
167876,m513,shampoo,L501291,u7586,FELICIA,That you were just indulging me.
167877,m513,shampoo,L501290,u7597,LESTER,What?
167878,m513,shampoo,L501289,u7586,FELICIA,Yes but... I thought...
167879,m513,shampoo,L501288,u7597,LESTER,You suggested it don't you think it's a good idea?
167880,m513,shampoo,L501287,u7586,FELICIA,I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
167881,m513,shampoo,L501286,u7597,LESTER,Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
167882,m513,shampoo,L501285,u7586,FELICIA,Why?
167883,m513,shampoo,L501284,u7597,LESTER,I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
167884,m513,shampoo,L501283,u7586,FELICIA,Maybe... why do you ask?
167885,m513,shampoo,L501282,u7597,LESTER,Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
167886,m513,shampoo,L501280,u7586,FELICIA,Well I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
167887,m513,shampoo,L501279,u7597,LESTER,That kid... the hairdresser.
167888,m513,shampoo,L501278,u7586,FELICIA,Who?
167889,m513,shampoo,L501277,u7597,LESTER,Do you think George is a fairy?

167891,m513,shampoo,L501648,u7588,GEORGE,Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?

168653,m513,shampoo,L501672,u7588,GEORGE,No it keeps the skin peeling. You've got to keep the follicles open. You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it.

168676,m513,shampoo,L501208,u7588,GEORGE,I know what you mean.
168677,m513,shampoo,L501207,u7597,LESTER,-- Anything I don't care what it is just so it's something.
168678,m513,shampoo,L501206,u7588,GEORGE,Oh yeah?
168679,m513,shampoo,L501205,u7597,LESTER,I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
168680,m513,shampoo,L501203,u7588,GEORGE,Okay.
168681,m513,shampoo,L501202,u7597,LESTER,-- maybe you could on your way you know pick up Jackie here.
168682,m513,shampoo,L501201,u7597,LESTER,Yeah little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
168683,m513,shampoo,L501200,u7588,GEORGE,Tonight?
168684,m513,shampoo,L501198,u7597,LESTER,When?
168685,m513,shampoo,L501197,u7588,GEORGE,When?
168686,m513,shampoo,L501196,u7597,LESTER,So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.
168687,m513,shampoo,L501195,u7588,GEORGE,Oh yeah? I mean I know.
168688,m513,shampoo,L501194,u7597,LESTER,Well George you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
168689,m513,shampoo,L501193,u7588,GEORGE,Oh yeah.
168690,m513,shampoo,L501192,u7597,LESTER,Felicia's really interested in the shop isn't she?
168691,m513,shampoo,L501159,u7588,GEORGE,Sure.
168692,m513,shampoo,L501158,u7597,LESTER,George could you -- excuse us for a minute?
168693,m513,shampoo,L501143,u7597,LESTER,Who needs that kind of aggravation? Who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? When I finish work I want to...
168694,m513,shampoo,L501142,u7588,GEORGE,You're right.
168695,m513,shampoo,L501141,u7597,LESTER,No they're a pain in the ass there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind am I right or am I right?
168696,m513,shampoo,L501140,u7588,GEORGE,They're not?
168697,m513,shampoo,L501139,u7597,LESTER,But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
168698,m513,shampoo,L501138,u7588,GEORGE,Thank you.
168699,m513,shampoo,L501137,u7597,LESTER,It's good you want to do something George.
168700,m513,shampoo,L501136,u7588,GEORGE,After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
168701,m513,shampoo,L501135,u7597,LESTER,Well George I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
168702,m513,shampoo,L501134,u7588,GEORGE,I'm better than the guy I work for.
168703,m513,shampoo,L501133,u7597,LESTER,But what?
168704,m513,shampoo,L501132,u7588,GEORGE,In a way. But...
168705,m513,shampoo,L501131,u7597,LESTER,But the important thing is you're successful at it.
168706,m513,shampoo,L501130,u7588,GEORGE,Yes it is.

168709,m513,shampoo,L501127,u7588,GEORGE,Oh well I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
168710,m513,shampoo,L501126,u7597,LESTER,I didn't say it she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
168711,m513,shampoo,L501125,u7588,GEORGE,Thank you.
168712,m513,shampoo,L501124,u7597,LESTER,She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.

168782,m513,shampoo,L501184,u7593,JACKIE,You're lying about one thing Lester.
168783,m513,shampoo,L501183,u7597,LESTER,Look... you do well for people they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money doll not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.

168785,m513,shampoo,L501180,u7593,JACKIE,Really? How about starting with tonight?
168786,m513,shampoo,L501179,u7597,LESTER,It's very logical it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner and a little conversation and so forth...
168787,m513,shampoo,L501175,u7593,JACKIE,That's not very logical Lester.
168788,m513,shampoo,L501174,u7597,LESTER,Of course not.
168789,m513,shampoo,L501173,u7593,JACKIE,So I can't talk to some broken down actor what do you think I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
168790,m513,shampoo,L501172,u7597,LESTER,Now listen Jackie I'm not jealous of anybody I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
168791,m513,shampoo,L501171,u7597,LESTER,I'm not jealous of the dogs.
168792,m513,shampoo,L501170,u7593,JACKIE,I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
168793,m513,shampoo,L501169,u7593,JACKIE,I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica what was I supposed to do hide in the ladies room? Yes I was talking to him.
168794,m513,shampoo,L501168,u7597,LESTER,Then you were talking to him.
168795,m513,shampoo,L501167,u7593,JACKIE,Steve Slutes and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
168796,m513,shampoo,L501166,u7597,LESTER,Whatever his name is that actor.
168797,m513,shampoo,L501165,u7593,JACKIE,Steve?

168804,m513,shampoo,L501156,u7597,LESTER,George is going to open a shop.
168805,m513,shampoo,L501155,u7593,JACKIE,I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
168806,m513,shampoo,L501152,u7597,LESTER,Is that right?
168807,m513,shampoo,L501151,u7593,JACKIE,Well yes George is a wonderful hairdresser.
168808,m513,shampoo,L501150,u7597,LESTER,Is that right?

168812,m513,shampoo,L500921,u7593,JACKIE,Anyway you're crazy.
168814,m513,shampoo,L500919,u7593,JACKIE,Fine.
168816,m513,shampoo,L500917,u7593,JACKIE,That's right.
168818,m513,shampoo,L500915,u7593,JACKIE,Poster-Kleiser.
168820,m513,shampoo,L500913,u7593,JACKIE,Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands want to come along?
168822,m513,shampoo,L500911,u7593,JACKIE,Hi Leonard.
168823,m513,shampoo,L501276,u7593,JACKIE,No he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God it was hot. The wood on the sundeck everything.
168824,m513,shampoo,L501275,u7594,JILL,No it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
168825,m513,shampoo,L501274,u7593,JACKIE,Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
168826,m513,shampoo,L501273,u7594,JILL,What did you do?
168827,m513,shampoo,L501272,u7593,JACKIE,-- He reached up and tore them.
168828,m513,shampoo,L501271,u7594,JILL,Didn't you have any panties on?
168829,m513,shampoo,L501270,u7593,JACKIE,-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt and you know right there...
168830,m513,shampoo,L501269,u7594,JILL,... Mmm-hmmm.
168831,m513,shampoo,L501268,u7593,JACKIE,-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
168832,m513,shampoo,L501267,u7594,JILL,-- uhh-huhh...
168833,m513,shampoo,L501266,u7593,JACKIE,-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
168834,m513,shampoo,L501265,u7594,JILL,-- Yesss?
168835,m513,shampoo,L501264,u7593,JACKIE,Well there was this one time --
168836,m513,shampoo,L501263,u7594,JILL,C'mon.
168837,m513,shampoo,L501262,u7593,JACKIE,-- I guess I just blocked it out that's all.
168838,m513,shampoo,L501261,u7594,JILL,-- Well -- not going in and out I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
168839,m513,shampoo,L501260,u7593,JACKIE,-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour do you mean continuous time? Just continually without stopping?
168840,m513,shampoo,L501259,u7594,JILL,-- See I just know that if I go to Egypt well things happen I just don't know what'll happen to us he just never seems to think ahead does he?
168841,m513,shampoo,L501258,u7594,JILL,I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
168842,m513,shampoo,L501257,u7593,JACKIE,What?
168843,m513,shampoo,L501256,u7594,JILL,Honey?
168844,m513,shampoo,L501255,u7593,JACKIE,I would say so yes.
168845,m513,shampoo,L501254,u7594,JILL,Quite a while... an hour an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while isn't It?
168846,m513,shampoo,L501253,u7593,JACKIE,It's been so long I don't how long?
168847,m513,shampoo,L501252,u7594,JILL,Well yes -- you know that about George.
168848,m513,shampoo,L501251,u7593,JACKIE,He does?
168849,m513,shampoo,L501250,u7594,JILL,Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it it's... he does it for a long time.
168850,m513,shampoo,L501249,u7593,JACKIE,What?
168851,m513,shampoo,L501248,u7594,JILL,Jackie --
168852,m513,shampoo,L501247,u7593,JACKIE,How much?
168853,m513,shampoo,L501246,u7594,JILL,I'm exaggerating.
168854,m513,shampoo,L501245,u7593,JACKIE,After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
168855,m513,shampoo,L501244,u7594,JILL,Well you know what I mean.
168856,m513,shampoo,L501243,u7593,JACKIE,Really Jill aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
168857,m513,shampoo,L501242,u7594,JILL,-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
168858,m513,shampoo,L501241,u7593,JACKIE,Five times a day?
168859,m513,shampoo,L501240,u7594,JILL,I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
168860,m513,shampoo,L501239,u7593,JACKIE,-- Yeah honey...
168861,m513,shampoo,L501238,u7594,JILL,But you have problems?
168862,m513,shampoo,L501237,u7593,JACKIE,We don't think marriage is important.
168863,m513,shampoo,L501236,u7594,JILL,Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
168864,m513,shampoo,L501235,u7593,JACKIE,I thought you said things were great with George.
168865,m513,shampoo,L501234,u7594,JILL,Well it's George.
168866,m513,shampoo,L501233,u7593,JACKIE,It must be something.
168867,m513,shampoo,L501232,u7594,JILL,Nothing.
168868,m513,shampoo,L501231,u7593,JACKIE,Well what is it honey?
168869,m513,shampoo,L501230,u7594,JILL,-- No. No really.
168870,m513,shampoo,L501229,u7593,JACKIE,You're really a love -- you sure?
168871,m513,shampoo,L501228,u7594,JILL,Don't be silly.
168872,m513,shampoo,L501227,u7593,JACKIE,Jill you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
168873,m513,shampoo,L500933,u7594,JILL,I guess not.
168874,m513,shampoo,L500932,u7593,JACKIE,Face it you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it time isn't on your side.
168875,m513,shampoo,L500931,u7594,JILL,George is great but I know what you mean.
168876,m513,shampoo,L500930,u7593,JACKIE,I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
168877,m513,shampoo,L500929,u7594,JILL,I know I'm sorry.
168878,m513,shampoo,L500928,u7593,JACKIE,Jill I'm just trying to be helpful.
168879,m513,shampoo,L500927,u7594,JILL,So what's your point?
168880,m513,shampoo,L500926,u7593,JACKIE,Well he is.
168881,m513,shampoo,L500925,u7593,JACKIE,No listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
168882,m513,shampoo,L500924,u7594,JILL,I'm not. Maybe I am.
168883,m513,shampoo,L500923,u7593,JACKIE,Oh honey don't be totally naive.
168884,m513,shampoo,L500922,u7594,JILL,I am? I mean why?
168885,m513,shampoo,L500910,u7593,JACKIE,A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
168886,m513,shampoo,L500909,u7594,JILL,Who is that?
168887,m513,shampoo,L500908,u7593,JACKIE,I think you're crazy. Don't look over it's Lenny Silverman.
168889,m513,shampoo,L501895,u7594,JILL,-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
168891,m513,shampoo,L501893,u7594,JILL,We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
168894,m513,shampoo,L501881,u7594,JILL,Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
168896,m513,shampoo,L501879,u7594,JILL,You're kidding.
168898,m513,shampoo,L501877,u7594,JILL,You're going?
168900,m513,shampoo,L501875,u7594,JILL,Now I didn't mean that you rat.
168902,m513,shampoo,L501873,u7594,JILL,-- so when are you going to Egypt?
168904,m513,shampoo,L501842,u7594,JILL,Oh Johnny Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
168906,m513,shampoo,L501818,u7594,JILL,-- why?
168907,m513,shampoo,L501776,u7594,JILL,Let's do that.
168910,m513,shampoo,L501711,u7594,JILL,-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
168912,m513,shampoo,L501644,u7594,JILL,That bastard.
168913,m513,shampoo,L501643,u7594,JILL,Well did he go in there with Jackie?
168915,m513,shampoo,L501641,u7594,JILL,George? Was he alone?
168917,m513,shampoo,L501639,u7594,JILL,Well... sure...
168920,m513,shampoo,L501539,u7594,JILL,Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
168922,m513,shampoo,L501537,u7594,JILL,He's a hairdresser.
168924,m513,shampoo,L501535,u7594,JILL,-- no.
168926,m513,shampoo,L501533,u7594,JILL,-- never mind.
168929,m513,shampoo,L501530,u7594,JILL,Johnny!
168931,m513,shampoo,L501528,u7594,JILL,Sort of.
168933,m513,shampoo,L501526,u7594,JILL,Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
168935,m513,shampoo,L501524,u7594,JILL,Well he's not exactly a friend.
168937,m513,shampoo,L501522,u7594,JILL,... my friend doesn't like it here either.
168939,m513,shampoo,L501520,u7594,JILL,Why don't you ask for another one?
168941,m513,shampoo,L500960,u7594,JILL,Oh. thank you.
168942,m513,shampoo,L500956,u7594,JILL,Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
168945,m513,shampoo,L500938,u7594,JILL,But why Egypt?
168947,m513,shampoo,L500936,u7594,JILL,Egypt?
168948,m513,shampoo,L501839,u7597,LESTER,-- just wonderful.
168949,m513,shampoo,L501838,u7594,JILL,Thank you.

168953,m513,shampoo,L501834,u7594,JILL,Jill.
168954,m513,shampoo,L501833,u7597,LESTER,What did you say your name was sweetheart?
168955,m513,shampoo,L501831,u7597,LESTER,That's fine --
168956,m513,shampoo,L501830,u7594,JILL,-- there's not much room --
168957,m513,shampoo,L501829,u7597,LESTER,-- oh no honey I'll do that...
168958,m513,shampoo,L501828,u7594,JILL,-- I'll get in the back --
168959,m513,shampoo,L501825,u7594,JILL,Sure thing Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
168960,m513,shampoo,L501824,u7597,LESTER,-- listen I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
168961,m513,shampoo,L501822,u7597,LESTER,Oh that's no problem.  -- take care of this boy's problem will you Gene?
168962,m513,shampoo,L501821,u7594,JILL,-- his car. They have it blocked.
168963,m513,shampoo,L501820,u7597,LESTER,-- what's the problem honey?
168965,m513,shampoo,L500958,u7594,JILL,Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
168968,m513,shampoo,L500953,u7594,JILL,No!

168978,m513,shampoo,L500941,u7594,JILL,No... how long did you say?
168980,m513,shampoo,L501848,u7597,LESTER,Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
168982,m513,shampoo,L501846,u7597,LESTER,Oh say how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
168984,m513,shampoo,L501844,u7597,LESTER,Call me Les.
168986,m513,shampoo,L501826,u7597,LESTER,Everything okay son?
168988,m513,shampoo,L501816,u7597,LESTER,No of course not.
168990,m513,shampoo,L501677,u7597,LESTER,Have they sat down?
169474,m516,sister act,L508652,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Really?
169476,m516,sister act,L508650,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Perhaps.
169478,m516,sister act,L508648,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Well... thank you.
169480,m516,sister act,L508646,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Oh?
169482,m516,sister act,L508352,u7628,CHRISTY,I said I was a nun not an asshole.
169484,m516,sister act,L508350,u7628,CHRISTY,Okay so maybe I'm a nun -- so you want to ask me something?  You want to listen for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
169485,m516,sister act,L508346,u7628,CHRISTY,Yeah you learned a whole lot I can tell.
169487,m516,sister act,L508339,u7628,CHRISTY,Well... yes.  Yes it is.

169492,m516,sister act,L509090,u7628,CHRISTY,And I'm tearful!
169494,m516,sister act,L509088,u7628,CHRISTY,But I'm fearful!
169496,m516,sister act,L509086,u7628,CHRISTY,Were you tempted?
169498,m516,sister act,L508735,u7628,CHRISTY,HE'S SO FINE...
169500,m516,sister act,L508733,u7628,CHRISTY,He's... dreamy.  He's...
169501,m516,sister act,L508633,u7628,CHRISTY,I think they hear you!
169503,m516,sister act,L508631,u7628,CHRISTY,You know what we're saying!
169506,m516,sister act,L508623,u7628,CHRISTY,You know I just might!
169508,m516,sister act,L508621,u7628,CHRISTY,I think I hear it!
169510,m516,sister act,L508619,u7628,CHRISTY,But how?
169512,m516,sister act,L508617,u7628,CHRISTY,What you say?
169514,m516,sister act,L508458,u7628,CHRISTY,You know it.
169516,m516,sister act,L508456,u7628,CHRISTY,How are you doing.
169517,m516,sister act,L508360,u7628,CHRISTY,Just tell him I do love you but I can't -- I'm a nun.
169519,m516,sister act,L508358,u7628,CHRISTY,Hey I know it's hard.  But do what I do.
169521,m516,sister act,L508356,u7628,CHRISTY,And you listen to that?
169523,m516,sister act,L508344,u7628,CHRISTY,Probation?
169525,m516,sister act,L508342,u7628,CHRISTY,Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?
169528,m516,sister act,L508335,u7628,CHRISTY,So hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?
169530,m516,sister act,L508988,u7628,CHRISTY,What?
169532,m516,sister act,L508877,u7628,CHRISTY,You can handle this.
169534,m516,sister act,L508875,u7628,CHRISTY,Mary Robert don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
169537,m516,sister act,L508046,u7628,CHRISTY,His ashes?
169538,m516,sister act,L508044,u7628,CHRISTY,Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road.
169540,m516,sister act,L508042,u7628,CHRISTY,What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
169541,m516,sister act,L509055,u7628,CHRISTY,That used to be true Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had well you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
169544,m516,sister act,L509031,u7628,CHRISTY,Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
169545,m516,sister act,L508940,u7628,CHRISTY,I feel sorry for you Vincent.  And I forgive you.
169547,m516,sister act,L508931,u7628,CHRISTY,I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
169549,m516,sister act,L508929,u7628,CHRISTY,Good evening Vincent.
169551,m516,sister act,L508096,u7628,CHRISTY,Right.  Yeah.  Forgotten.
169553,m516,sister act,L508094,u7628,CHRISTY,Sure.
169555,m516,sister act,L508092,u7628,CHRISTY,Thanks.  A lot.
169557,m516,sister act,L508090,u7628,CHRISTY,No... it's fine.
169558,m516,sister act,L508017,u7628,CHRISTY,You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I garbage?  Am I lint?
169560,m516,sister act,L508015,u7628,CHRISTY,You pig!
169562,m516,sister act,L508013,u7628,CHRISTY,You bastard!
169564,m516,sister act,L508011,u7628,CHRISTY,What? 
169566,m516,sister act,L508009,u7628,CHRISTY,You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
169568,m516,sister act,L508007,u7628,CHRISTY,You did what?
169570,m516,sister act,L508005,u7628,CHRISTY,Today was the deadline Vince.
169572,m516,sister act,L508003,u7628,CHRISTY,Vince...
169574,m516,sister act,L508001,u7628,CHRISTY,Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.
169576,m516,sister act,L507999,u7628,CHRISTY,Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
169577,m516,sister act,L508037,u7628,CHRISTY,WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.
169579,m516,sister act,L508035,u7628,CHRISTY,HE'S SO FINE.
169581,m516,sister act,L508033,u7628,CHRISTY,He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
169583,m516,sister act,L508031,u7628,CHRISTY,Look at that.  Get a gander.
169585,m516,sister act,L508029,u7628,CHRISTY,Oh my! 
169587,m516,sister act,L508027,u7628,CHRISTY,This prom is a real drag.
169589,m516,sister act,L508025,u7628,CHRISTY,Oh girls.
169590,m516,sister act,L509084,u7628,CHRISTY,Were you wicked?
169591,m516,sister act,L509083,u7633,MARY PATRICK,SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
169592,m516,sister act,L509082,u7628,CHRISTY,Pay attention...
169593,m516,sister act,L509081,u7633,MARY PATRICK,BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
169594,m516,sister act,L509080,u7628,CHRISTY,What a shame!
169595,m516,sister act,L509079,u7633,MARY PATRICK,DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
169596,m516,sister act,L509078,u7628,CHRISTY,It's true -- I know her.
169597,m516,sister act,L509077,u7633,MARY PATRICK,MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
169598,m516,sister act,L508825,u7628,CHRISTY,Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
169599,m516,sister act,L508824,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Hurry Sister!
169600,m516,sister act,L508739,u7633,MARY PATRICK,This is so exhilarating!  All week long I can't wait till Sunday when we sing.
169601,m516,sister act,L508738,u7628,CHRISTY,Jackpot!  Two buckets
169602,m516,sister act,L508728,u7628,CHRISTY,That man -- who is he?
169603,m516,sister act,L508727,u7633,MARY PATRICK,What is it Mary?
169604,m516,sister act,L508675,u7628,CHRISTY,And we know that even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.
169605,m516,sister act,L508674,u7633,MARY PATRICK,We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
169606,m516,sister act,L508606,u7628,CHRISTY,Because we're
169607,m516,sister act,L508605,u7633,MARY PATRICK,SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
169608,m516,sister act,L508604,u7628,CHRISTY,So use it.  When we sing hymns they're usually about rejoicing right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
169609,m516,sister act,L508602,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Am I?
169610,m516,sister act,L508601,u7628,CHRISTY,Hold it.  Mary Patrick you're a pretty cheerful person aren't you?
169611,m516,sister act,L508600,u7633,MARY PATRICK,The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
169612,m516,sister act,L508599,u7628,CHRISTY,Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
169613,m516,sister act,L508598,u7628,CHRISTY,It's a rhythm section.  The beat.
169614,m516,sister act,L508597,u7633,MARY PATRICK,I know.  It's ancient.
169615,m516,sister act,L508596,u7628,CHRISTY,That machine.
169616,m516,sister act,L508586,u7628,CHRISTY,No way.  We're a choir right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
169617,m516,sister act,L508585,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Two days.  An hour or so.
169618,m516,sister act,L508575,u7628,CHRISTY,The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick you re not a natural soprano you're an alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with the sopranos.
169619,m516,sister act,L508574,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Chops?
169620,m516,sister act,L508573,u7628,CHRISTY,You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
169621,m516,sister act,L508555,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Mary Clarence could you?  Mary Lazarus you're terrific but...  Could you help us?
169622,m516,sister act,L508554,u7628,CHRISTY,Hold on.
169623,m516,sister act,L508527,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Sure is!  Come on in and sing a spell.
169624,m516,sister act,L508526,u7628,CHRISTY,Is this... choir practice?
169625,m516,sister act,L508396,u7628,CHRISTY,I love my heddles.  Show me again.
169626,m516,sister act,L508395,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Shuttle beat shed.  And watch your heddles.
169627,m516,sister act,L508394,u7633,MARY PATRICK,You betcha.
169628,m516,sister act,L508393,u7628,CHRISTY,Just about.  Show me again.
169629,m516,sister act,L508392,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in keep it pressed against the pick and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle beat and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat beat shuttle beat shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
169630,m516,sister act,L508391,u7628,CHRISTY,Oh right.  At my old place we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
169631,m516,sister act,L508390,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
169632,m516,sister act,L508389,u7628,CHRISTY,But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
169633,m516,sister act,L508388,u7633,MARY PATRICK,To sell of course.  I hate to say it but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof the furnace is going and there's no money.
169634,m516,sister act,L508387,u7628,CHRISTY,Why?
169635,m516,sister act,L508386,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Well it all comes back in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging of the convent.
169636,m516,sister act,L508385,u7628,CHRISTY,Not in years.
169637,m516,sister act,L508384,u7633,MARY PATRICK,The minute I saw you. I said to myself she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?
169638,m516,sister act,L508312,u7628,CHRISTY,No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
169639,m516,sister act,L508311,u7633,MARY PATRICK,1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
169640,m516,sister act,L508308,u7633,MARY PATRICK,I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
169641,m516,sister act,L508307,u7628,CHRISTY,Where did that come from?
169642,m516,sister act,L508292,u7628,CHRISTY,Right.
169643,m516,sister act,L508291,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
169644,m516,sister act,L509098,u7628,CHRISTY,Sing!
169647,m516,sister act,L509059,u7628,CHRISTY,Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
169648,m516,sister act,L509040,u7628,CHRISTY,You know?  About me?  About everything?
169650,m516,sister act,L508799,u7628,CHRISTY,That's true wouldn't that be great.  Of course we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent tomorrow.
169652,m516,sister act,L508795,u7628,CHRISTY,Well... see at my old convent I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
169654,m516,sister act,L508762,u7628,CHRISTY,What?
169657,m516,sister act,L508669,u7628,CHRISTY,Babies
169659,m516,sister act,L508667,u7628,CHRISTY,Hopeless I
169661,m516,sister act,L508665,u7628,CHRISTY,Don't look at your feet and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
169663,m516,sister act,L508593,u7628,CHRISTY,It'll be hell.
169664,m516,sister act,L508591,u7628,CHRISTY,A bunch of real mama's girls.
169666,m516,sister act,L508589,u7628,CHRISTY,I don't know.  Mary Lazarus what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
169667,m516,sister act,L508584,u7628,CHRISTY,I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
169669,m516,sister act,L508582,u7628,CHRISTY,Mary Lazarus I get the feeling that you like discipline.  Hard work.
169671,m516,sister act,L508580,u7628,CHRISTY,Yeah for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
169672,m516,sister act,L508564,u7628,CHRISTY,Mary Robert.
169675,m516,sister act,L508552,u7628,CHRISTY,What?
169677,m516,sister act,L508550,u7628,CHRISTY,Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
169678,m516,sister act,L508547,u7628,CHRISTY,Um I don't really know this one...
169680,m516,sister act,L508531,u7628,CHRISTY,Whatever.
169682,m516,sister act,L508310,u7628,CHRISTY,You know that song?
169685,m516,sister act,L508299,u7628,CHRISTY,Like this place?
169687,m516,sister act,L508297,u7628,CHRISTY,What?
169689,m516,sister act,L508295,u7628,CHRISTY,Which convent?  It was um the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
169690,m516,sister act,L509076,u7635,MARY ROBERT,HE SAID SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
169691,m516,sister act,L509075,u7628,CHRISTY,What did He say?
169692,m516,sister act,L509074,u7635,MARY ROBERT,BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
169693,m516,sister act,L509073,u7628,CHRISTY,Don't you know it!
169694,m516,sister act,L509072,u7635,MARY ROBERT,I WAS HELL-BOUND YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
169695,m516,sister act,L509071,u7628,CHRISTY,It's true!
169696,m516,sister act,L509070,u7635,MARY ROBERT,I WAS DOWNHEARTED
169697,m516,sister act,L509057,u7628,CHRISTY,Bless you.
169698,m516,sister act,L509056,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Mary Clarence!
169699,m516,sister act,L508873,u7628,CHRISTY,She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
169700,m516,sister act,L508872,u7635,MARY ROBERT,But what do they want?  Where are we going?
169701,m516,sister act,L508870,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Again?
169702,m516,sister act,L508869,u7628,CHRISTY,Run!  Take off!
169703,m516,sister act,L508868,u7628,CHRISTY,They're from my old convent.
169704,m516,sister act,L508867,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Wait this isn't the way.  Who are you?
169705,m516,sister act,L508816,u7628,CHRISTY,Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?
169706,m516,sister act,L508815,u7635,MARY ROBERT,The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
169707,m516,sister act,L508801,u7628,CHRISTY,Oh no.  We'll always be together.
169708,m516,sister act,L508800,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Are you leaving us?
169709,m516,sister act,L508793,u7635,MARY ROBERT,A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
169710,m516,sister act,L508792,u7628,CHRISTY,It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.
169711,m516,sister act,L508678,u7635,MARY ROBERT,We're nuns!
169712,m516,sister act,L508677,u7628,CHRISTY,Yes prayer is the answer and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
169713,m516,sister act,L508662,u7635,MARY ROBERT,HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL DON'T STEAL IT'S BAD FOR YOU
169714,m516,sister act,L508661,u7628,CHRISTY,WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT NOW DO YOUR PART
169715,m516,sister act,L508568,u7628,CHRISTY,Give me a C.  A C!
169716,m516,sister act,L508567,u7635,MARY ROBERT,I don't want to mess anyone up...
169717,m516,sister act,L508566,u7628,CHRISTY,Mary Robert I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
169718,m516,sister act,L508565,u7635,MARY ROBERT,What?
169719,m516,sister act,L508529,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother but -- I don't know if she understood.
169720,m516,sister act,L508528,u7628,CHRISTY,Mary Robert I am so sorry about last night...
169721,m516,sister act,L508499,u7635,MARY ROBERT,We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you Mary Clarence!
169722,m516,sister act,L508498,u7628,CHRISTY,I don't know some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
169723,m516,sister act,L508497,u7635,MARY ROBERT,What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
169724,m516,sister act,L508496,u7628,CHRISTY,Experience!
169725,m516,sister act,L508495,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Oh my Lord!
169726,m516,sister act,L508494,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Mary Clarence!
169727,m516,sister act,L508493,u7628,CHRISTY,Goddamn it!
169728,m516,sister act,L508491,u7628,CHRISTY,Keep moving!
169729,m516,sister act,L508490,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Mary Clarence!
169730,m516,sister act,L508488,u7628,CHRISTY,Well you know you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
169731,m516,sister act,L508487,u7635,MARY ROBERT,I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
169732,m516,sister act,L508486,u7628,CHRISTY,Honey.
169733,m516,sister act,L508485,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
169734,m516,sister act,L508484,u7628,CHRISTY,Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
169735,m516,sister act,L508483,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
169736,m516,sister act,L508480,u7628,CHRISTY,You watch yourself!
169737,m516,sister act,L508479,u7635,MARY ROBERT,I'm getting experience.
169738,m516,sister act,L508471,u7628,CHRISTY,This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
169739,m516,sister act,L508470,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Who are all these people?
169740,m516,sister act,L508468,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Really?
169741,m516,sister act,L508467,u7628,CHRISTY,Initiation.  You understand.  Later on we make her wear her underwear on her head.
169742,m516,sister act,L508466,u7635,MARY ROBERT,I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
169743,m516,sister act,L508464,u7628,CHRISTY,Right.
169744,m516,sister act,L508463,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Experience!  Right?
169745,m516,sister act,L508462,u7628,CHRISTY,Bobs
169746,m516,sister act,L508460,u7628,CHRISTY,It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
169747,m516,sister act,L508459,u7635,MARY ROBERT,We need experience.
169748,m516,sister act,L508454,u7628,CHRISTY,Now you.
169749,m516,sister act,L508453,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Mary Clarence!
169750,m516,sister act,L508449,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Are you sure?
169751,m516,sister act,L508448,u7628,CHRISTY,We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
169752,m516,sister act,L508447,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
169753,m516,sister act,L508446,u7628,CHRISTY,We must do this sacred thing Mary Robert.
169754,m516,sister act,L508444,u7628,CHRISTY,Reverend Mother says you need experience right in life.  In order to make a responsible decision.  This is going to be very painful for me.  You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent.  Wait.
169755,m516,sister act,L508443,u7635,MARY ROBERT,What?
169756,m516,sister act,L508442,u7628,CHRISTY,Well then there's only one thing to do.
169757,m516,sister act,L508441,u7628,CHRISTY,She said that?  Reverend Mother?
169758,m516,sister act,L508440,u7635,MARY ROBERT,She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
169759,m516,sister act,L508439,u7628,CHRISTY,She won't?  Why not?
169760,m516,sister act,L508438,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Oh. Mary Clarence I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows I would do it tomorrow but Reverend Mother won't let me!
169761,m516,sister act,L508437,u7628,CHRISTY,Excuse me?
169762,m516,sister act,L508436,u7635,MARY ROBERT,No you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
169763,m516,sister act,L508435,u7628,CHRISTY,Right sure but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
169764,m516,sister act,L508434,u7635,MARY ROBERT,You have to help me
169765,m516,sister act,L508432,u7628,CHRISTY,Yeah like a learner's permit right? When do you hit the big time?  You know when do you take the final vows?
169766,m516,sister act,L508431,u7635,MARY ROBERT,A novice.
169767,m516,sister act,L508430,u7628,CHRISTY,Three years.  A rookie.
169768,m516,sister act,L508429,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Three years.  Sister.
169769,m516,sister act,L508428,u7628,CHRISTY,So Bob how long have you been in? St. K's?
169770,m516,sister act,L508427,u7628,CHRISTY,Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.
169771,m516,sister act,L508426,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
169772,m516,sister act,L508425,u7628,CHRISTY,Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?
169773,m516,sister act,L508424,u7635,MARY ROBERT,An extra heel of bread.  Please take it you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
169774,m516,sister act,L508423,u7628,CHRISTY,A cigarette?
169775,m516,sister act,L508422,u7635,MARY ROBERT,I... I brought you something.
169776,m516,sister act,L508421,u7628,CHRISTY,What?
169777,m516,sister act,L508420,u7635,MARY ROBERT,I... I...
169778,m516,sister act,L508419,u7628,CHRISTY,What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?
169779,m516,sister act,L508290,u7628,CHRISTY,Five a.m.?
169780,m516,sister act,L508289,u7635,MARY ROBERT,It's after five.  We have to bathe.
169781,m516,sister act,L508288,u7628,CHRISTY,What?  What time is it?
169782,m516,sister act,L508287,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Come on we're late.
169783,m516,sister act,L509069,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Don't push it.
169784,m516,sister act,L509068,u7628,CHRISTY,Really?  And maybe shorter habits and women priests and sleeping late?
169785,m516,sister act,L509067,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
169786,m516,sister act,L509066,u7628,CHRISTY,What about me Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
169787,m516,sister act,L509065,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,You have evidenced great maturity Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
169788,m516,sister act,L509064,u7628,CHRISTY,I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
169789,m516,sister act,L509050,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
169790,m516,sister act,L509049,u7628,CHRISTY,Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
169791,m516,sister act,L509044,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,I'm a Christian.
169792,m516,sister act,L509043,u7628,CHRISTY,You saved my life.
169793,m516,sister act,L509042,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Oh?
169794,m516,sister act,L509041,u7628,CHRISTY,Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
169795,m516,sister act,L509007,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Saving you.  Move!
169796,m516,sister act,L509006,u7628,CHRISTY,What are you doing here?
169797,m516,sister act,L508787,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Good day.
169798,m516,sister act,L508786,u7628,CHRISTY,But...
169799,m516,sister act,L508785,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,I am sorry Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day Mary Clarence.
169800,m516,sister act,L508784,u7628,CHRISTY,Okay so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
169801,m516,sister act,L508783,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
169802,m516,sister act,L508782,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,A part of what?  Mary Clarence it is one thing to rabble rouse to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
169803,m516,sister act,L508781,u7628,CHRISTY,But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
169804,m516,sister act,L508780,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet it would seem I know nothing.
169805,m516,sister act,L508779,u7628,CHRISTY,But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look if it's about me I mean I'm gone.
169806,m516,sister act,L508778,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,I must go where I can be of use.
169807,m516,sister act,L508777,u7628,CHRISTY,But -- why?
169808,m516,sister act,L508776,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
169809,m516,sister act,L508775,u7628,CHRISTY,What?
169810,m516,sister act,L508774,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Really.  Well that makes two of us.
169811,m516,sister act,L508773,u7628,CHRISTY,Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.
169812,m516,sister act,L508765,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,You have a phone call.
169813,m516,sister act,L508764,u7628,CHRISTY,You sent for me?
169814,m516,sister act,L508758,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,The majority has spoken.
169815,m516,sister act,L508757,u7628,CHRISTY,But... wait a minute...
169816,m516,sister act,L508756,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Of course.  Mary Clarence a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that I am certain will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
169817,m516,sister act,L508755,u7628,CHRISTY,A vote?
169818,m516,sister act,L508754,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
169819,m516,sister act,L508753,u7628,CHRISTY,Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
169820,m516,sister act,L508750,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church.  They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
169821,m516,sister act,L508749,u7628,CHRISTY,What do you mean?
169822,m516,sister act,L508748,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,And on such an occasion I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
169823,m516,sister act,L508644,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
169824,m516,sister act,L508643,u7628,CHRISTY,Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
169825,m516,sister act,L508642,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Out of the question.
169826,m516,sister act,L508641,u7628,CHRISTY,Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
169827,m516,sister act,L508640,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
169828,m516,sister act,L508639,u7628,CHRISTY,Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
169829,m516,sister act,L508638,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
169830,m516,sister act,L508637,u7628,CHRISTY,I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
169831,m516,sister act,L508525,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,The choir Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.
169832,m516,sister act,L508524,u7628,CHRISTY,Not the choir please anything but that.  The choir -- I mean have you heard them?  I'll do anything scrub floors toilets you name it but not that I
169833,m516,sister act,L508523,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,You're my Olympic event.
169834,m516,sister act,L508522,u7628,CHRISTY,No.  No.
169835,m516,sister act,L508521,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,You will sing and you will sleep' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass you will be unable to cause further damage.
169836,m516,sister act,L508520,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,You have I believe some minimal background in music.  Therefore you are to join our choir.
169837,m516,sister act,L508519,u7628,CHRISTY,What?
169838,m516,sister act,L508518,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
169839,m516,sister act,L508517,u7628,CHRISTY,I am?
169840,m516,sister act,L508516,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Mary Clarence perhaps you are correct.
169841,m516,sister act,L508515,u7628,CHRISTY,But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I like your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
169842,m516,sister act,L508514,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Clearly you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat both to this convent and to yourself.
169843,m516,sister act,L508513,u7628,CHRISTY,A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
169844,m516,sister act,L508512,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Mary Clarence I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
169845,m516,sister act,L508511,u7628,CHRISTY,I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
169846,m516,sister act,L508510,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
169847,m516,sister act,L508509,u7628,CHRISTY,Look... I know I shouldn't have I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert I wasn't thinking I didn't know that would happen!
169848,m516,sister act,L508508,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
169849,m516,sister act,L508507,u7628,CHRISTY,So... hi there.
169850,m516,sister act,L508403,u7628,CHRISTY,Look this isn't my kind of thing!  I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
169851,m516,sister act,L508402,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Months of work and the loom absolutely ruined!
169852,m516,sister act,L508401,u7628,CHRISTY,I'm sorry I'm not a weaver!
169853,m516,sister act,L508400,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Good.  Mary Patrick I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence carry on.
169854,m516,sister act,L508399,u7628,CHRISTY,Really catching on.
169855,m516,sister act,L508375,u7628,CHRISTY,In English?
169856,m516,sister act,L508373,u7628,CHRISTY,It never solves anything.
169857,m516,sister act,L508372,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
169858,m516,sister act,L508371,u7628,CHRISTY,Sometimes it's not enough!
169859,m516,sister act,L508370,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,We are nuns.  We seek solutions through prayer.
169860,m516,sister act,L508369,u7628,CHRISTY,Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
169861,m516,sister act,L508368,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,This is a convent not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance not hardware.
169862,m516,sister act,L508367,u7628,CHRISTY,Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
169863,m516,sister act,L508366,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,A balloon and a banana!  Tell me Mary Clarence what were you thinking?
169864,m516,sister act,L508364,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Mary Clarence!
169865,m516,sister act,L508363,u7628,CHRISTY,Deal with it sweet thing.  It's important nowadays.  You just practice at home with a balloon and a banana.
169866,m516,sister act,L508334,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Come Sister.
169867,m516,sister act,L508333,u7628,CHRISTY,I got it.
169868,m516,sister act,L508332,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Girls this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
169869,m516,sister act,L508331,u7628,CHRISTY,Yeah?
169870,m516,sister act,L508283,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,From all I've heard just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent and your married lover wants you dead. 
169871,m516,sister act,L508282,u7628,CHRISTY,What's wrong with my life?
169872,m516,sister act,L508281,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,I'm sure.  If I were you I would use this time to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
169873,m516,sister act,L508280,u7628,CHRISTY,Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
169874,m516,sister act,L508279,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
169875,m516,sister act,L508278,u7628,CHRISTY,Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
169876,m516,sister act,L508277,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Your cell is more than adequate.
169877,m516,sister act,L508276,u7628,CHRISTY,Oh I don't know... Satan?
169878,m516,sister act,L508275,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,And whom would you call?
169879,m516,sister act,L508274,u7628,CHRISTY,It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
169880,m516,sister act,L508273,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Useless distractions.
169881,m516,sister act,L508272,u7628,CHRISTY,Right sure thing.  But what about like appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
169882,m516,sister act,L508271,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
169883,m516,sister act,L508270,u7628,CHRISTY,You were right the first time.  Is this like solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
169884,m516,sister act,L508269,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Your cell.  Your room.
169885,m516,sister act,L508268,u7628,CHRISTY,My what?
169886,m516,sister act,L508267,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,This shall be your cell Mary Clarence.
169887,m516,sister act,L508266,u7628,CHRISTY,That's tomorrow!  Don't you have any snacks?  Machines?
169888,m516,sister act,L508265,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Yes.  Until breakfast.
169889,m516,sister act,L508264,u7628,CHRISTY,Is this all the food I get?
169890,m516,sister act,L508255,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,No food.  Not until sundown.
169891,m516,sister act,L508254,u7628,CHRISTY,No food?
169892,m516,sister act,L508253,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,A fast.  To remind us of the poor of those who must endure without enough to eat.
169893,m516,sister act,L508252,u7628,CHRISTY,A what?
169894,m516,sister act,L508251,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,As a new member of our order I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
169895,m516,sister act,L508248,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Until sundown.
169896,m516,sister act,L508247,u7628,CHRISTY,Silence?  No talking?  All day?
169897,m516,sister act,L508246,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Surely you are familiar with this practice Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent can our prayers truly be heard.
169898,m516,sister act,L508245,u7628,CHRISTY,A what?
169899,m516,sister act,L508244,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Sisters for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
169900,m516,sister act,L508234,u7628,CHRISTY,I'm outta here.
169901,m516,sister act,L508233,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,And the vow of chastity.
169902,m516,sister act,L508232,u7628,CHRISTY,Like to who?
169903,m516,sister act,L508231,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,The vow of obedience.
169904,m516,sister act,L508230,u7628,CHRISTY,No problem.
169905,m516,sister act,L508229,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
169906,m516,sister act,L508228,u7628,CHRISTY,Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb guy?
169907,m516,sister act,L508227,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,As of now and until you leave you are Sister Mary Clarence.
169908,m516,sister act,L508226,u7628,CHRISTY,But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
169909,m516,sister act,L508225,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Normally dressed you are a sore thumb and you endanger us all.  While you are here you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who and what you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
169910,m516,sister act,L508224,u7628,CHRISTY,No!  No!  I can't do this!
169911,m516,sister act,L508223,u7628,CHRISTY,Can do.
169912,m516,sister act,L508222,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
169913,m516,sister act,L508220,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Would you like that?
169914,m516,sister act,L508218,u7628,CHRISTY,Deal.
169915,m516,sister act,L508217,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Before we do you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
169916,m516,sister act,L508216,u7628,CHRISTY,Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
169917,m516,sister act,L508215,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
169918,m516,sister act,L508214,u7628,CHRISTY,Fine.  Got it.  Look the way I see it I'm stuck here right?  I mean I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep watch some tube lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room and do not disturb.  Capisce?
169919,m516,sister act,L508213,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Check your driver's license.
169920,m516,sister act,L508212,u7628,CHRISTY,What's a concubine?
169921,m516,sister act,L508211,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
169922,m516,sister act,L508210,u7628,CHRISTY,You mean black people?
169923,m516,sister act,L508209,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,And all those like you.
169924,m516,sister act,L508208,u7628,CHRISTY,Are you talking about me?
169925,m516,sister act,L508207,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality to families to children to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And as the years have passed I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
169926,m516,sister act,L508206,u7628,CHRISTY,What?
169927,m516,sister act,L508205,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,It has come to pass.
169928,m516,sister act,L508204,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Your cigarette -- out.
169929,m516,sister act,L508203,u7628,CHRISTY,What? 
169930,m516,sister act,L508202,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Miss Van Cartier.
169931,m516,sister act,L508200,u7628,CHRISTY,What?
169932,m516,sister act,L508199,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Sit down.
169933,m516,sister act,L508198,u7628,CHRISTY,You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
169934,m516,sister act,L508197,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,I see.
169935,m516,sister act,L508196,u7628,CHRISTY,Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting without a chaperone. Heavy petting with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra under my uniform.  The demon bra.
169936,m516,sister act,L508195,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,The reason?
169937,m516,sister act,L508194,u7628,CHRISTY,I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
169938,m516,sister act,L508193,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,You were unhappy?
169939,m516,sister act,L508192,u7628,CHRISTY,Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
169940,m516,sister act,L508191,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,St. Anne's?
169941,m516,sister act,L508190,u7628,CHRISTY,Oh my God.  This isn't happening tell me this isn't happening.  It's a nightmare I'm back at St. Anne's!
169942,m516,sister act,L508189,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Very well.
169943,m516,sister act,L508188,u7628,CHRISTY,That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
169944,m516,sister act,L508187,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Enough joking.
169945,m516,sister act,L508186,u7628,CHRISTY,Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
169946,m516,sister act,L508185,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Your name?
169947,m516,sister act,L508184,u7628,CHRISTY,Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
169948,m516,sister act,L508183,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
169949,m516,sister act,L508182,u7628,CHRISTY,A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
169950,m516,sister act,L509053,u7628,CHRISTY,Yeah like what?
169951,m516,sister act,L509052,u7629,EDDIE,I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
169952,m516,sister act,L509051,u7628,CHRISTY,Yeah Eddie thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think after all this maybe I really am a nun?
169953,m516,sister act,L509046,u7628,CHRISTY,That depends.  Sisters you don't know this but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing if we thought that was true.
169954,m516,sister act,L509045,u7629,EDDIE,Don't you have a concert to go to?
169955,m516,sister act,L508852,u7628,CHRISTY,Even nuns have to pee.
169956,m516,sister act,L508851,u7629,EDDIE,What're you doing?
169957,m516,sister act,L508844,u7629,EDDIE,Nuns?
169958,m516,sister act,L508842,u7629,EDDIE,They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
169959,m516,sister act,L508841,u7628,CHRISTY,That's not the point!  They need me!
169960,m516,sister act,L508840,u7629,EDDIE,I think they'd understand.
169961,m516,sister act,L508839,u7628,CHRISTY,Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
169962,m516,sister act,L508833,u7629,EDDIE,You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
169963,m516,sister act,L508832,u7628,CHRISTY,I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
169964,m516,sister act,L508831,u7629,EDDIE,What?
169965,m516,sister act,L508830,u7628,CHRISTY,I can't go with you.
169966,m516,sister act,L508829,u7629,EDDIE,Long story.  His goons will be here any minute.  We've got to get you out of here '- now!
169967,m516,sister act,L508828,u7628,CHRISTY,How?
169968,m516,sister act,L508827,u7629,EDDIE,Vince knows you're here.
169969,m516,sister act,L508717,u7628,CHRISTY,I know I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try.
169970,m516,sister act,L508716,u7629,EDDIE,Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
169971,m516,sister act,L508715,u7628,CHRISTY,I've got to go.
169972,m516,sister act,L508712,u7629,EDDIE,You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
169973,m516,sister act,L508711,u7628,CHRISTY,I have?
169974,m516,sister act,L508710,u7629,EDDIE,No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.

169979,m516,sister act,L508705,u7628,CHRISTY,You mean -- worried about my testimony?

169986,m516,sister act,L508698,u7629,EDDIE,Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
169987,m516,sister act,L508697,u7628,CHRISTY,I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
169988,m516,sister act,L508696,u7629,EDDIE,You're supposed to be hiding out!
169989,m516,sister act,L508695,u7628,CHRISTY,It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
169990,m516,sister act,L508694,u7629,EDDIE,What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
169991,m516,sister act,L508693,u7628,CHRISTY,Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
169992,m516,sister act,L508506,u7629,EDDIE,Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
169993,m516,sister act,L508505,u7628,CHRISTY,So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
169994,m516,sister act,L508504,u7629,EDDIE,She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
169995,m516,sister act,L508503,u7628,CHRISTY,Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
169996,m516,sister act,L508502,u7629,EDDIE,You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
169997,m516,sister act,L508501,u7628,CHRISTY,What'd she say?
169998,m516,sister act,L508416,u7629,EDDIE,Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
169999,m516,sister act,L508415,u7628,CHRISTY,Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie in here that's what they call music!
170000,m516,sister act,L508414,u7628,CHRISTY,But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
170001,m516,sister act,L508413,u7629,EDDIE,I just need a few more weeks
170002,m516,sister act,L508412,u7628,CHRISTY,You son-of-a-bitch!
170003,m516,sister act,L508411,u7629,EDDIE,Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them but there's a leak in the department and they end up dead.
170004,m516,sister act,L508410,u7628,CHRISTY,Like what?
170005,m516,sister act,L508409,u7629,EDDIE,Calm down.  Look I didn't want to tell you this but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
170006,m516,sister act,L508408,u7628,CHRISTY,But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend?

Check your crotch Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
170007,m516,sister act,L508407,u7629,EDDIE,Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
170008,m516,sister act,L508406,u7628,CHRISTY,Eddie you've got to get me out of here.
170009,m516,sister act,L508164,u7629,EDDIE,Pray.

170011,m516,sister act,L508162,u7629,EDDIE,Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month maybe two tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
170012,m516,sister act,L508161,u7628,CHRISTY,But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
170013,m516,sister act,L508160,u7629,EDDIE,And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
170014,m516,sister act,L508157,u7628,CHRISTY,With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back work things out with Vince.
170015,m516,sister act,L508156,u7629,EDDIE,It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up behave yourself and get along.
170016,m516,sister act,L508155,u7628,CHRISTY,Nuns Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
170017,m516,sister act,L508154,u7629,EDDIE,Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?
170018,m516,sister act,L508153,u7628,CHRISTY,I hate you.  I totally hate you.
170019,m516,sister act,L508152,u7629,EDDIE,I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
170020,m516,sister act,L508151,u7628,CHRISTY,What're you gonna do put me in a bag and bury me?
170021,m516,sister act,L508150,u7629,EDDIE,No nothing.
170022,m516,sister act,L508149,u7628,CHRISTY,Okay -- no limo.
170023,m516,sister act,L508148,u7629,EDDIE,Jesus what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
170024,m516,sister act,L508141,u7629,EDDIE,Maybe Hawaii.
170025,m516,sister act,L508140,u7628,CHRISTY,Okay here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.

170033,m516,sister act,L508117,u7629,EDDIE,He didn't do you a favor.
170034,m516,sister act,L508116,u7628,CHRISTY,I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
170035,m516,sister act,L508113,u7628,CHRISTY,I never said he was an altar boy okay? But he sent his goons after me!  They tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!
170036,m516,sister act,L508112,u7629,EDDIE,You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
170037,m516,sister act,L508111,u7628,CHRISTY,Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
170038,m516,sister act,L508072,u7628,CHRISTY,Think again!  And get out of here.
170039,m516,sister act,L508071,u7629,EDDIE,Information baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
170040,m516,sister act,L508070,u7628,CHRISTY,When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
170041,m516,sister act,L508069,u7629,EDDIE,A what? When are you qonna wake up?

170047,m516,sister act,L508061,u7629,EDDIE,I used to buy.you..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
170048,m516,sister act,L508060,u7628,CHRISTY,At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
170049,m516,sister act,L508059,u7629,EDDIE,From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang doo- lang.
170050,m516,sister act,L508726,u7628,CHRISTY,But -- wait.
170052,m516,sister act,L508724,u7628,CHRISTY,People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean really.
170054,m516,sister act,L508722,u7628,CHRISTY,Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.

170065,m516,sister act,L508124,u7629,EDDIE,We could put you into our witness protection program.
170124,m516,sister act,L508897,u7633,MARY PATRICK,We've got to save her!
170126,m516,sister act,L508891,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
170128,m516,sister act,L508859,u7633,MARY PATRICK,We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
170130,m516,sister act,L508817,u7633,MARY PATRICK,It should be here any minute.
170132,m516,sister act,L508682,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Are you going to shoot us all tough guy?
170133,m516,sister act,L508921,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Measles.
170134,m516,sister act,L508920,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,However we can also pray for other things.
170135,m516,sister act,L508919,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Peace on Earth.
170136,m516,sister act,L508903,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas Nevada.
170137,m516,sister act,L508902,u7633,MARY PATRICK,She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
170138,m516,sister act,L508884,u7633,MARY PATRICK,But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
170139,m516,sister act,L508883,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
170140,m516,sister act,L508655,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Really...
170141,m516,sister act,L508654,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous Reverend Mother.
170142,m516,sister act,L508398,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Oh she's doing just fine Reverend Mother -
170143,m516,sister act,L508397,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?

170147,m516,sister act,L508238,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Reverend Mother on behalf of the sisters I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
170148,m516,sister act,L508237,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Yes Mary Patrick?
170149,m516,sister act,L509048,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Impossible.
170150,m516,sister act,L509047,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Not a note.
170151,m516,sister act,L509038,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Christy.
170152,m516,sister act,L509037,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
170153,m516,sister act,L508998,u7635,MARY ROBERT,A Benedictine.
170154,m516,sister act,L508997,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
170155,m516,sister act,L508969,u7633,MARY PATRICK,But how do we get there?
170156,m516,sister act,L508968,u7635,MARY ROBERT,The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
170157,m516,sister act,L508943,u7635,MARY ROBERT,And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
170158,m516,sister act,L508942,u7633,MARY PATRICK,It's so beautiful...
170159,m516,sister act,L508894,u7633,MARY PATRICK,She's our inspiration!
170160,m516,sister act,L508893,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Well I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
170161,m516,sister act,L508888,u7633,MARY PATRICK,She wasn't a nun?
170162,m516,sister act,L508887,u7635,MARY ROBERT,An... entertainer?
170163,m516,sister act,L508882,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
170164,m516,sister act,L508881,u7633,MARY PATRICK,You mean -- they kidnapped her?
170165,m516,sister act,L508838,u7633,MARY PATRICK,We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
170166,m516,sister act,L508837,u7635,MARY ROBERT,We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
170167,m516,sister act,L508835,u7635,MARY ROBERT,It's no use.  She just isn't here.
170168,m516,sister act,L508834,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Mary Clarence!  Sister!
170169,m516,sister act,L508797,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
170170,m516,sister act,L508796,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Mary Clarence don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools and nursing homes.
170171,m516,sister act,L508790,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
170172,m516,sister act,L508789,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Ice cream!
170173,m516,sister act,L508752,u7635,MARY ROBERT,It's brought people back to the church.
170174,m516,sister act,L508751,u7633,MARY PATRICK,But Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
170175,m516,sister act,L508742,u7635,MARY ROBERT,It's better than springtime.
170176,m516,sister act,L508741,u7633,MARY PATRICK,It's better than ice cream.
170177,m516,sister act,L508740,u7635,MARY ROBERT,I'd rather sing than do anything!
170178,m516,sister act,L508732,u7633,MARY PATRICK,He's kind.
170179,m516,sister act,L508731,u7635,MARY ROBERT,He's decent.
170180,m516,sister act,L508730,u7633,MARY PATRICK,He's not like other guys.
170181,m516,sister act,L508579,u7635,MARY ROBERT,That was exciting!
170182,m516,sister act,L508578,u7633,MARY PATRICK,We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
170183,m516,sister act,L508549,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Really Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
170184,m516,sister act,L508548,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
170185,m516,sister act,L508294,u7633,MARY PATRICK,Which convent was that Sister?
170186,m516,sister act,L508293,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Is this like your old convent?
170187,m516,sister act,L509063,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's I've been shot at kidnapped by Mafia hit men and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?
170188,m516,sister act,L509062,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Yes?
170189,m516,sister act,L509061,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Reverend Mother?
170190,m516,sister act,L508966,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,But where?
170191,m516,sister act,L508965,u7635,MARY ROBERT,Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
170192,m516,sister act,L508901,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't have an old convent.
170193,m516,sister act,L508900,u7635,MARY ROBERT,She said they were from her old convent.
170194,m516,sister act,L508899,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert do you have any idea who those men were?
170195,m516,sister act,L508862,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Her whereabouts are unknown and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
170196,m516,sister act,L508861,u7635,MARY ROBERT,I don't understand.  Where is she?
170198,m516,sister act,L508658,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,But Bishop surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
170200,m516,sister act,L508173,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,I lied.
170202,m516,sister act,L508171,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,But Bishop...
170204,m516,sister act,L508169,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,We're a small convent Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
170206,m516,sister act,L508167,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
170208,m516,sister act,L508165,u7637,MOTHER SUPERIOR,Absolutely not.  I am very sorry but no.

173813,m528,sphere,L527277,u7805,BARNES,Fletcher I want you back here.
173816,m528,sphere,L527272,u7805,BARNES,Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
173817,m528,sphere,L527585,u7805,BARNES,Pull it damn it!
173818,m528,sphere,L527584,u7806,BETH,Norman please!  Don't!
173819,m528,sphere,L527583,u7805,BARNES,Now!
173820,m528,sphere,L527582,u7806,BETH,Don't do it!
173821,m528,sphere,L527580,u7806,BETH,Norman don't do it!
173822,m528,sphere,L527579,u7805,BARNES,Do it Norman it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
173823,m528,sphere,L527578,u7806,BETH,Don't pull it Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
173824,m528,sphere,L527575,u7805,BARNES,Do you see it?
173825,m528,sphere,L527574,u7806,BETH,Don't do it Norman!
173826,m528,sphere,L527564,u7805,BARNES,It's either that or we grow gills.
173827,m528,sphere,L527563,u7806,BETH,That's our reserve air.
173828,m528,sphere,L527562,u7805,BARNES,Increase positive pressure!
173829,m528,sphere,L527559,u7805,BARNES,He's right beneath us.
173830,m528,sphere,L527558,u7806,BETH,What was that?
173831,m528,sphere,L527557,u7805,BARNES,Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
173832,m528,sphere,L527556,u7806,BETH,Where is it?
173833,m528,sphere,L527552,u7806,BETH,What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
173834,m528,sphere,L527551,u7805,BARNES,Thirty yards.
173835,m528,sphere,L527550,u7805,BARNES,Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
173836,m528,sphere,L527549,u7806,BETH,But you've tested it?
173837,m528,sphere,L527548,u7805,BARNES,Forty yards.
173838,m528,sphere,L527547,u7805,BARNES,It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
173839,m528,sphere,L527546,u7806,BETH,High Voltage?
173840,m528,sphere,L527545,u7805,BARNES,We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
173841,m528,sphere,L527544,u7806,BETH,What do we use for defense?
173842,m528,sphere,L527543,u7805,BARNES,Fifty yards and closing.
173843,m528,sphere,L527542,u7806,BETH,What if it attacks?
173844,m528,sphere,L527541,u7805,BARNES,A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
173845,m528,sphere,L527537,u7806,BETH,What was that?
173846,m528,sphere,L527536,u7805,BARNES,Direction's east coming!
173847,m528,sphere,L527530,u7805,BARNES,Shut up Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
173848,m528,sphere,L527529,u7806,BETH,Nice work Captain sir.
173849,m528,sphere,L527491,u7805,BARNES,You're a fucking biochemist aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
173850,m528,sphere,L527490,u7806,BETH,I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
173851,m528,sphere,L527289,u7805,BARNES,Nobody move!
173852,m528,sphere,L527288,u7806,BETH,But she's --
173853,m528,sphere,L527287,u7805,BARNES,Nobody move.
173854,m528,sphere,L527249,u7806,BETH,Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
173855,m528,sphere,L527248,u7805,BARNES,There are procedures Beth that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on I want you to follow them very closely.
173856,m528,sphere,L527247,u7806,BETH,Yeah.  I heard you.
173857,m528,sphere,L527246,u7805,BARNES,Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
173858,m528,sphere,L527224,u7806,BETH,Two and a half days?
173859,m528,sphere,L527223,u7805,BARNES,They told me about sixty hours.
173860,m528,sphere,L527222,u7806,BETH,How long will that be?
173861,m528,sphere,L527221,u7805,BARNES,The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
173862,m528,sphere,L527198,u7805,BARNES,Edmunds do you have a 20 on Norman?
173863,m528,sphere,L527197,u7806,BETH,Norman!
173864,m528,sphere,L527191,u7805,BARNES,What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds the subs?
173865,m528,sphere,L527190,u7806,BETH,I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team we leave as a team.
173866,m528,sphere,L527110,u7805,BARNES,Yeasts?  Thank you Beth but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
173867,m528,sphere,L527109,u7806,BETH,Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
173868,m528,sphere,L527007,u7806,BETH,How about I just press the button?
173869,m528,sphere,L527006,u7805,BARNES,Alright Beth do that thing you did before.
173870,m528,sphere,L526999,u7806,BETH,Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
173871,m528,sphere,L526998,u7805,BARNES,What is it?
173872,m528,sphere,L526997,u7806,BETH,Hold on --
173873,m528,sphere,L526988,u7806,BETH,Would you wait a minute?
173874,m528,sphere,L526987,u7805,BARNES,I said back away.
173875,m528,sphere,L526986,u7806,BETH,Wait a minute --
173876,m528,sphere,L526985,u7805,BARNES,Back away then.
173877,m528,sphere,L526984,u7806,BETH,There's heat coming the door.
173878,m528,sphere,L526854,u7805,BARNES,Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
173879,m528,sphere,L526853,u7806,BETH,In basic English what does all this mean?
173880,m528,sphere,L526845,u7805,BARNES,Of what we're able to measure roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
173881,m528,sphere,L526844,u7806,BETH,How big is this spacecraft?
173882,m528,sphere,L527577,u7805,BARNES,Pull it.
173883,m528,sphere,L527576,u7811,NORMAN,I see it.
173884,m528,sphere,L527571,u7805,BARNES,You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
173885,m528,sphere,L527570,u7811,NORMAN,Yes sir.  I'm here.
173886,m528,sphere,L527555,u7805,BARNES,Ted go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
173887,m528,sphere,L527554,u7811,NORMAN,Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
173888,m528,sphere,L527553,u7805,BARNES,What the hell?  It shut us down.
173889,m528,sphere,L527539,u7811,NORMAN,Jerry?
173890,m528,sphere,L527538,u7805,BARNES,Going active.
173891,m528,sphere,L527527,u7805,BARNES,No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
173892,m528,sphere,L527526,u7811,NORMAN,Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
173893,m528,sphere,L527525,u7805,BARNES,Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
173894,m528,sphere,L527524,u7811,NORMAN,Yes I do.  Whatever's out there I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
173895,m528,sphere,L527523,u7805,BARNES,You think he killed Edmunds?
173896,m528,sphere,L527520,u7811,NORMAN,But sir I think it's imperative.  I think the messages the animals we've seen what killed Edmunds the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
173897,m528,sphere,L527519,u7805,BARNES,I don't want you talking to Jerry.
173898,m528,sphere,L527488,u7811,NORMAN,At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring.
173899,m528,sphere,L527487,u7805,BARNES,If something should happen to us the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
173900,m528,sphere,L527486,u7811,NORMAN,What for?
173901,m528,sphere,L527454,u7805,BARNES,Edmunds?  Can you copy?
173902,m528,sphere,L527453,u7811,NORMAN,... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
173903,m528,sphere,L527452,u7805,BARNES,Damn it Edmunds?
173904,m528,sphere,L527451,u7811,NORMAN,Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
173905,m528,sphere,L527450,u7805,BARNES,Edmunds?
173906,m528,sphere,L527422,u7811,NORMAN,I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
173907,m528,sphere,L527421,u7805,BARNES,You don't think weapons are important?
173908,m528,sphere,L527420,u7811,NORMAN,That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
173909,m528,sphere,L527419,u7805,BARNES,Great okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
173910,m528,sphere,L527379,u7805,BARNES,What am I -- a dog now?
173911,m528,sphere,L527378,u7811,NORMAN,The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand letting it sniff get used to you.
173912,m528,sphere,L527337,u7811,NORMAN,-- I didn't know it would come to this --
173913,m528,sphere,L527336,u7805,BARNES,-- and then brought her down here --
173914,m528,sphere,L527335,u7811,NORMAN,Wait a second --
173915,m528,sphere,L527334,u7805,BARNES,You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
173916,m528,sphere,L527333,u7811,NORMAN,At the time I don't know I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
173917,m528,sphere,L527332,u7805,BARNES,So you knew this when you wrote your report?
173918,m528,sphere,L527331,u7811,NORMAN,'81 I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
173919,m528,sphere,L527330,u7805,BARNES,When was this?
173920,m528,sphere,L527329,u7811,NORMAN,She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
173921,m528,sphere,L527328,u7805,BARNES,She should've known better.
173922,m528,sphere,L527327,u7811,NORMAN,A while back Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah I know.  And when she finished her work he kicked her out broke off the relationship and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
173923,m528,sphere,L527326,u7805,BARNES,I think I do.
173924,m528,sphere,L527325,u7811,NORMAN,You don't want to know.
173925,m528,sphere,L527324,u7805,BARNES,How drastic?
173926,m528,sphere,L527323,u7811,NORMAN,I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
173927,m528,sphere,L527181,u7811,NORMAN,But sir --
173928,m528,sphere,L527180,u7805,BARNES,I told you people nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
173929,m528,sphere,L527179,u7811,NORMAN,You can't just leave Harry down here sir.
173930,m528,sphere,L527161,u7805,BARNES,He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
173931,m528,sphere,L527160,u7811,NORMAN,He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
173932,m528,sphere,L527159,u7805,BARNES,What do you mean he's missing?
173933,m528,sphere,L527158,u7811,NORMAN,Harry's missing.
173934,m528,sphere,L527152,u7805,BARNES,Just worry about yourself.
173935,m528,sphere,L527151,u7811,NORMAN,All I'm saying is someone should keep an eye on him.
173936,m528,sphere,L527150,u7805,BARNES,Look the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there if it's that imprtant.
173937,m528,sphere,L527149,u7811,NORMAN,I'm telling you Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
173938,m528,sphere,L527148,u7805,BARNES,Don't get hysterical Norman.
173939,m528,sphere,L527108,u7805,BARNES,Everything can be killed.
173940,m528,sphere,L527107,u7811,NORMAN,I don't know.  That's the point.
173941,m528,sphere,L527106,u7805,BARNES,You mean what's in that thing is immortal?
173942,m528,sphere,L527105,u7811,NORMAN,Or maybe it can't <u>be</u> killed.
173943,m528,sphere,L527095,u7811,NORMAN,If it is alien maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.
173944,m528,sphere,L527094,u7805,BARNES,What?
173945,m528,sphere,L527093,u7811,NORMAN,Maybe we shouldn't.
173946,m528,sphere,L527076,u7805,BARNES,I don't know.  But it's something alien.
173947,m528,sphere,L527075,u7811,NORMAN,Picked up something?  What is it?
173948,m528,sphere,L526977,u7811,NORMAN,Take a look.
173949,m528,sphere,L526976,u7805,BARNES,What is it Norman?
173950,m528,sphere,L526921,u7805,BARNES,It's a corrosive gas.  On earth it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly iron rust on an Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it down here and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile.
173951,m528,sphere,L526920,u7811,NORMAN,What's wrong with oxygen?
173952,m528,sphere,L526919,u7805,BARNES,They pressurize us with helium.
173953,m528,sphere,L526843,u7811,NORMAN,But sir I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
173954,m528,sphere,L526842,u7805,BARNES,Your report's become our bible down here Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
173955,m528,sphere,L526841,u7811,NORMAN,ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
173956,m528,sphere,L526840,u7805,BARNES,The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
173957,m528,sphere,L526839,u7811,NORMAN,What team?
173958,m528,sphere,L526838,u7805,BARNES,We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
173959,m528,sphere,L526837,u7811,NORMAN,It doesn't make any sense.
173960,m528,sphere,L526836,u7805,BARNES,Off the record I don't mind telling you this thing scares the shit out of me.
173961,m528,sphere,L526835,u7805,BARNES,I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
173962,m528,sphere,L526834,u7811,NORMAN,It's impossible.
173963,m528,sphere,L526833,u7805,BARNES,Extraordinary isn't it?
173964,m528,sphere,L526832,u7811,NORMAN,-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
173965,m528,sphere,L526831,u7805,BARNES,Maybe older --
173966,m528,sphere,L526830,u7811,NORMAN,Hold on --
173967,m528,sphere,L526829,u7805,BARNES,-- dating the crash at least that old.
173968,m528,sphere,L526828,u7811,NORMAN,-- Wait a second --
173969,m528,sphere,L526827,u7805,BARNES,Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
173970,m528,sphere,L526826,u7811,NORMAN,Geologists?
173971,m528,sphere,L526825,u7805,BARNES,See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
173972,m528,sphere,L526823,u7805,BARNES,As best we can estimate it crashed four hundred years ago.
173973,m528,sphere,L526822,u7811,NORMAN,Not really no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
173974,m528,sphere,L526821,u7805,BARNES,Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
173975,m528,sphere,L526820,u7811,NORMAN,What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
173976,m528,sphere,L526817,u7811,NORMAN,What do you need me for?
173977,m528,sphere,L526816,u7805,BARNES,What?
173978,m528,sphere,L526815,u7811,NORMAN,Then why am I here?
173979,m528,sphere,L526814,u7805,BARNES,Survivors?  No I wouldn't think so.
173980,m528,sphere,L526813,u7811,NORMAN,A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here but I assume there are no survivors.
173981,m528,sphere,L526812,u7805,BARNES,A thousand feet.
173982,m528,sphere,L526811,u7811,NORMAN,How deep is he?
173983,m528,sphere,L526809,u7811,NORMAN,They didn't tell me anything.
173984,m528,sphere,L526808,u7805,BARNES,A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
173985,m528,sphere,L526807,u7811,NORMAN,Storm?  What storm?
173986,m528,sphere,L526806,u7805,BARNES,We're moving fast considering the storm.
173987,m528,sphere,L526805,u7805,BARNES,Well we don't have all the facts yet.
173988,m528,sphere,L526804,u7811,NORMAN,From what?  What's with all the security?
173989,m528,sphere,L526803,u7805,BARNES,Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.
173990,m528,sphere,L526802,u7811,NORMAN,Press?  No I haven't.
173991,m528,sphere,L526801,u7805,BARNES,You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
173992,m528,sphere,L526798,u7811,NORMAN,Nothing else.
173993,m528,sphere,L526797,u7805,BARNES,Anything else?
173994,m528,sphere,L526796,u7811,NORMAN,The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
173995,m528,sphere,L526795,u7805,BARNES,What have you been told so far?
173996,m528,sphere,L526794,u7811,NORMAN,What team?
173997,m528,sphere,L526793,u7805,BARNES,Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
173998,m528,sphere,L526792,u7811,NORMAN,The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
173999,m528,sphere,L526791,u7805,BARNES,Don't thank me Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
174000,m528,sphere,L526790,u7811,NORMAN,Well thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
174001,m528,sphere,L526789,u7811,NORMAN,Captain.  Right forgive me.
174002,m528,sphere,L526788,u7805,BARNES,Captain.
174003,m528,sphere,L526787,u7811,NORMAN,Thank you Colonel.
174005,m528,sphere,L527380,u7805,BARNES,Edmunds get in here.  I need you for this.
174007,m528,sphere,L527211,u7805,BARNES,Norman get out of there now! Norman?
174009,m528,sphere,L527206,u7805,BARNES,They've left keep watching!
174012,m528,sphere,L527200,u7805,BARNES,Well where the fuck is he?
174014,m528,sphere,L527193,u7805,BARNES,What the hell is going on here?
174016,m528,sphere,L527187,u7805,BARNES,Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
174018,m528,sphere,L527185,u7805,BARNES,Any sign of Harry?
174019,m528,sphere,L527184,u7805,BARNES,They're coming.
174021,m528,sphere,L527178,u7805,BARNES,Send them damn it!  I know but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
174024,m528,sphere,L527172,u7805,BARNES,Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
174026,m528,sphere,L527142,u7805,BARNES,What caused it?
174027,m528,sphere,L526936,u7805,BARNES,Well shit -- find something do something... make something up --
174029,m528,sphere,L526934,u7805,BARNES,Thank you I can see that.  Try something else.
174032,m528,sphere,L526928,u7805,BARNES,Can you open that panel?
174033,m528,sphere,L527443,u7809,HARRY,If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
174034,m528,sphere,L527442,u7805,BARNES,She wired this system.
174035,m528,sphere,L527441,u7809,HARRY,She's not gonna know.
174036,m528,sphere,L527440,u7805,BARNES,Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
174037,m528,sphere,L527416,u7809,HARRY,What -- you want me to retype it?
174038,m528,sphere,L527414,u7805,BARNES,I'm in charge.
174039,m528,sphere,L527412,u7805,BARNES,What?
174040,m528,sphere,L527408,u7809,HARRY,She's not gonna know sir.
174041,m528,sphere,L527407,u7805,BARNES,Not now Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
174042,m528,sphere,L527400,u7809,HARRY,He understands me fine.
174043,m528,sphere,L527399,u7805,BARNES,Are you enjoying yourself Harry because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
174044,m528,sphere,L527397,u7809,HARRY,It's not ignorant.
174045,m528,sphere,L527396,u7805,BARNES,Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
174046,m528,sphere,L527375,u7805,BARNES,How do you mean strange?
174047,m528,sphere,L527374,u7809,HARRY,I have to tell you.  It's strange.
174048,m528,sphere,L527373,u7805,BARNES,What's the message?
174049,m528,sphere,L527341,u7805,BARNES,We're all very proud of you Harry but what the hell is it?
174050,m528,sphere,L527340,u7809,HARRY,It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
174051,m528,sphere,L527169,u7809,HARRY,Please watch your closest monitor...
174052,m528,sphere,L527168,u7805,BARNES,Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
174053,m528,sphere,L527167,u7809,HARRY,Ladies and Gentlemen...
174054,m528,sphere,L527166,u7805,BARNES,Gimme a report I want --
174055,m528,sphere,L527117,u7805,BARNES,Just tell me worst case.  Worst case of what we might find?
174056,m528,sphere,L527116,u7809,HARRY,Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us just like we are to say medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
174057,m528,sphere,L527115,u7805,BARNES,You don't know that.
174058,m528,sphere,L527114,u7809,HARRY,It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
174059,m528,sphere,L527113,u7805,BARNES,Or it could contain some great benefit to us some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
174060,m528,sphere,L527101,u7809,HARRY,It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
174061,m528,sphere,L527100,u7805,BARNES,So?  What's the problem?
174062,m528,sphere,L527097,u7805,BARNES,The what?
174063,m528,sphere,L527096,u7809,HARRY,Man is man all he knows is man and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good Norman.
174064,m528,sphere,L527092,u7809,HARRY,Ted seems to have some ideas.
174065,m528,sphere,L527091,u7805,BARNES,So how do we get it open?
174066,m528,sphere,L527089,u7805,BARNES,A break for what?
174067,m528,sphere,L527088,u7809,HARRY,To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
174068,m528,sphere,L527087,u7805,BARNES,What?
174069,m528,sphere,L527086,u7809,HARRY,No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
174070,m528,sphere,L527074,u7805,BARNES,So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
174071,m528,sphere,L527073,u7809,HARRY,We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
174072,m528,sphere,L527072,u7805,BARNES,Yes Harry.
174073,m528,sphere,L527071,u7809,HARRY,Ted?  Captain?
174074,m528,sphere,L526983,u7809,HARRY,Then how can it be chipped?
174075,m528,sphere,L526982,u7805,BARNES,I did.
174076,m528,sphere,L526981,u7809,HARRY,I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
174077,m528,sphere,L526980,u7805,BARNES,I don't know how it can be chipped but it's chipped.
174078,m528,sphere,L526979,u7809,HARRY,Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
174079,m528,sphere,L526978,u7805,BARNES,It's chipped.
174080,m528,sphere,L526851,u7805,BARNES,I'm not saying anything Harry I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
174081,m528,sphere,L526850,u7809,HARRY,Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
174082,m528,sphere,L526849,u7805,BARNES,To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
174083,m528,sphere,L526848,u7809,HARRY,How much damage?
174084,m528,sphere,L527484,u7814,TED,What sub?
174085,m528,sphere,L527483,u7805,BARNES,Resetting the sub.
174086,m528,sphere,L527482,u7814,TED,What was Edmunds doing outside?
174087,m528,sphere,L527481,u7805,BARNES,Well until we know exactly what it is nobody goes outside understood?
174088,m528,sphere,L527467,u7814,TED,Too big?
174089,m528,sphere,L527466,u7805,BARNES,It won't register.  It's too big to image.
174090,m528,sphere,L527465,u7814,TED,What?
174091,m528,sphere,L527464,u7805,BARNES,The sensors are picking up something outside.
174092,m528,sphere,L527463,u7814,TED,What is that?
174093,m528,sphere,L527447,u7814,TED,Don't make stuff up these emotional theories just so you can feel important here.
174094,m528,sphere,L527446,u7805,BARNES,Edmunds?
174095,m528,sphere,L527392,u7814,TED,Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language not the other way around.
174096,m528,sphere,L527391,u7805,BARNES,It's not talking it's mimicking.
174097,m528,sphere,L527384,u7805,BARNES,I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
174098,m528,sphere,L527383,u7814,TED,Captain I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
174099,m528,sphere,L527382,u7805,BARNES,I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name rank and serial number.
174100,m528,sphere,L527349,u7814,TED,What's inside the sphere.
174101,m528,sphere,L527348,u7805,BARNES,From the sphere?
174102,m528,sphere,L527275,u7805,BARNES,Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside understood?
174103,m528,sphere,L527274,u7814,TED,She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know I never knew that.
174104,m528,sphere,L527219,u7805,BARNES,Internal power.
174105,m528,sphere,L527218,u7814,TED,To what?
174106,m528,sphere,L527217,u7805,BARNES,They switched us over.
174107,m528,sphere,L527164,u7805,BARNES,We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
174108,m528,sphere,L527163,u7814,TED,Sir about leaving --
174109,m528,sphere,L527162,u7805,BARNES,How can he be missing?
174110,m528,sphere,L527157,u7805,BARNES,Ted shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
174111,m528,sphere,L527156,u7814,TED,Did you hear me sir because --
174112,m528,sphere,L527154,u7805,BARNES,What?  No I know they're civilians...
174113,m528,sphere,L527153,u7814,TED,Can I stay sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
174114,m528,sphere,L527083,u7814,TED,Maybe it's a message of some sort you know?  See this red here.
174115,m528,sphere,L527082,u7805,BARNES,But what does it do?  This... sphere.
174116,m528,sphere,L527052,u7814,TED,Maybe we didn't want to come back.
174117,m528,sphere,L527051,u7805,BARNES,What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
174118,m528,sphere,L527050,u7814,TED,Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
174119,m528,sphere,L527041,u7814,TED,Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
174120,m528,sphere,L527040,u7805,BARNES,We had considered it.
174121,m528,sphere,L527013,u7805,BARNES,What do you make of this?
174122,m528,sphere,L527012,u7814,TED,What's wrong?
174123,m528,sphere,L526996,u7814,TED,A foot and a half thick?  That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
174124,m528,sphere,L526995,u7805,BARNES,Radiation shield you think?
174125,m528,sphere,L526994,u7814,TED,Some sort of lead or something.
174126,m528,sphere,L526993,u7805,BARNES,What is it?
174127,m528,sphere,L526992,u7814,TED,Look at this.
174128,m528,sphere,L526990,u7814,TED,What are you going to do -- shoot her?
174129,m528,sphere,L526989,u7805,BARNES,Ted get her away from the door.
174130,m528,sphere,L526939,u7814,TED,What if we go out there you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
174131,m528,sphere,L526938,u7805,BARNES,What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
174132,m528,sphere,L526932,u7805,BARNES,Duly noted Ted.  Edmunds try using suction.
174133,m528,sphere,L526931,u7814,TED,I'd also like it noted --
174134,m528,sphere,L526927,u7805,BARNES,Nobody goes inside until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
174135,m528,sphere,L526926,u7814,TED,Captain you know I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
174136,m528,sphere,L526847,u7805,BARNES,The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
174137,m528,sphere,L526846,u7814,TED,A half a mile long?
174138,m528,sphere,L528072,u7811,NORMAN,Down below Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
174139,m528,sphere,L528071,u7806,BETH,How's that?
174140,m528,sphere,L528070,u7811,NORMAN,Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
174141,m528,sphere,L528069,u7806,BETH,Would it work?
174142,m528,sphere,L527993,u7806,BETH,Get away --
174143,m528,sphere,L527992,u7811,NORMAN,Beth --
174144,m528,sphere,L527991,u7806,BETH,Get away from me!
174145,m528,sphere,L527990,u7811,NORMAN,Hear what?
174146,m528,sphere,L527989,u7806,BETH,You hear that?
174147,m528,sphere,L527988,u7811,NORMAN,What?
174148,m528,sphere,L527987,u7806,BETH,What is that?  What are you doing?
174149,m528,sphere,L527983,u7811,NORMAN,Let's get out of here Beth.  Let's go home.
174150,m528,sphere,L527982,u7806,BETH,Top shelf is it?
174151,m528,sphere,L527981,u7811,NORMAN,C'mon --
174152,m528,sphere,L527980,u7806,BETH,Oh sure.  Here.  Anything else Beth can get you?  Some more chicken perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
174153,m528,sphere,L527979,u7811,NORMAN,Beth -- gimme the gun.
174154,m528,sphere,L527978,u7806,BETH,Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
174155,m528,sphere,L527977,u7811,NORMAN,I --
174156,m528,sphere,L527976,u7806,BETH,Oh please don't shrink me Norman. Not now.
174157,m528,sphere,L527975,u7811,NORMAN,I know.  You're too strong Beth.
174158,m528,sphere,L527974,u7806,BETH,You can't stop it Norman.  You can't fight me.
174159,m528,sphere,L527972,u7806,BETH,Leave me alone Norman.
174160,m528,sphere,L527971,u7811,NORMAN,Beth?
174161,m528,sphere,L527957,u7806,BETH,It's you Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
174162,m528,sphere,L527956,u7811,NORMAN,Stop it!
174163,m528,sphere,L527954,u7806,BETH,From you Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
174164,m528,sphere,L527953,u7811,NORMAN,Then where's it coming from?
174165,m528,sphere,L527952,u7806,BETH,Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
174166,m528,sphere,L527951,u7811,NORMAN,Beth stop it!
174167,m528,sphere,L527950,u7806,BETH,Don't you know?
174168,m528,sphere,L527949,u7811,NORMAN,Where is it coming from Beth?
174169,m528,sphere,L527948,u7806,BETH,You're frightened aren't you Norman?
174170,m528,sphere,L527947,u7811,NORMAN,Beth!
174171,m528,sphere,L527945,u7806,BETH,I'm not fucking with you Norman. You've fucked yourself.
174172,m528,sphere,L527944,u7811,NORMAN,Don't fuck with me Beth.
174173,m528,sphere,L527943,u7806,BETH,Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
174174,m528,sphere,L527938,u7811,NORMAN,Get away from the door Beth.
174175,m528,sphere,L527937,u7806,BETH,This is what I'm talking about Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
174176,m528,sphere,L527932,u7806,BETH,You think I care?  You think I care if I die?  Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before Norman why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No Norman I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
174177,m528,sphere,L527931,u7811,NORMAN,It's not safe for you to be either.
174178,m528,sphere,L527930,u7806,BETH,It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
174179,m528,sphere,L527928,u7806,BETH,It's either this... or I kill you.
174180,m528,sphere,L527927,u7811,NORMAN,Don't Beth.  Please.
174181,m528,sphere,L527926,u7806,BETH,You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
174182,m528,sphere,L527925,u7811,NORMAN,Beth --
174183,m528,sphere,L527924,u7806,BETH,Promise what Norman?  Tell me!
174184,m528,sphere,L527923,u7811,NORMAN,I promise --
174185,m528,sphere,L527922,u7806,BETH,But I have to Norman.
174186,m528,sphere,L527921,u7811,NORMAN,Don't Beth.
174187,m528,sphere,L527919,u7811,NORMAN,It's not me Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
174188,m528,sphere,L527918,u7806,BETH,I'm not scaring you am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay don't you?
174189,m528,sphere,L527916,u7811,NORMAN,Shut up Beth --
174190,m528,sphere,L527913,u7806,BETH,Is it?
174191,m528,sphere,L527912,u7811,NORMAN,That's bullshit.
174192,m528,sphere,L527910,u7811,NORMAN,Yes.
174193,m528,sphere,L527909,u7806,BETH,You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry don't you?  You remember that.
174194,m528,sphere,L527908,u7811,NORMAN,I never went in that sphere.
174195,m528,sphere,L527907,u7806,BETH,Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
174196,m528,sphere,L527906,u7811,NORMAN,You're insane.
174197,m528,sphere,L527905,u7806,BETH,Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that Norman.
174198,m528,sphere,L527904,u7811,NORMAN,You manifested that Beth.
174199,m528,sphere,L527903,u7806,BETH,One lonely terrifying sea snake.
174200,m528,sphere,L527902,u7811,NORMAN,That's when you went in the sphere.
174201,m528,sphere,L527901,u7806,BETH,And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
174202,m528,sphere,L527900,u7811,NORMAN,But --
174203,m528,sphere,L527899,u7806,BETH,Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear aren't they?
174204,m528,sphere,L527898,u7811,NORMAN,You're lying --
174205,m528,sphere,L527897,u7806,BETH,C'mon -- what?
174206,m528,sphere,L527896,u7811,NORMAN,Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
174207,m528,sphere,L527895,u7806,BETH,Yes someone did.  But it wasn't me Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
174208,m528,sphere,L527894,u7811,NORMAN,Someone did.
174209,m528,sphere,L527893,u7806,BETH,You think I manifested the snakes?
174210,m528,sphere,L527892,u7811,NORMAN,Then why Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
174211,m528,sphere,L527891,u7806,BETH,No he can't.
174212,m528,sphere,L527890,u7811,NORMAN,He can't manifest.
174213,m528,sphere,L527889,u7806,BETH,No he isn't.
174214,m528,sphere,L527888,u7811,NORMAN,Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
174215,m528,sphere,L527887,u7806,BETH,Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
174216,m528,sphere,L527886,u7811,NORMAN,Why did you go in the sphere Beth?
174217,m528,sphere,L527884,u7811,NORMAN,Did you?
174218,m528,sphere,L527883,u7806,BETH,If I was then I would've had to have gone in the sphere wouldn't I?
174219,m528,sphere,L527882,u7811,NORMAN,Are you manifesting them?
174220,m528,sphere,L527881,u7806,BETH,Don't you?
174221,m528,sphere,L527880,u7811,NORMAN,Do you fear them?
174222,m528,sphere,L527879,u7806,BETH,You tell me.
174223,m528,sphere,L527878,u7811,NORMAN,What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
174224,m528,sphere,L527877,u7806,BETH,Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out they don't bite. Fortunately for you I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
174225,m528,sphere,L527876,u7811,NORMAN,You know what I mean.
174226,m528,sphere,L527875,u7806,BETH,Snakes?  What do you mean exactly?
174227,m528,sphere,L527874,u7811,NORMAN,How do you feel about snakes?
174228,m528,sphere,L527873,u7806,BETH,I did do that didn't I?
174229,m528,sphere,L527872,u7811,NORMAN,You put explosives around the habitat I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
174230,m528,sphere,L527871,u7806,BETH,You don't think I put something in it do you?
174231,m528,sphere,L527870,u7811,NORMAN,You think I'd really drink that?
174232,m528,sphere,L527869,u7806,BETH,It's getting cold.
174233,m528,sphere,L527868,u7806,BETH,Are you?
174234,m528,sphere,L527867,u7811,NORMAN,I'm feeling better.
174235,m528,sphere,L527866,u7806,BETH,What's wrong Norman?
174236,m528,sphere,L527862,u7806,BETH,Oh yes my watch.  I almost forgot.
174237,m528,sphere,L527861,u7811,NORMAN,Your watch.
174238,m528,sphere,L527860,u7806,BETH,What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
174239,m528,sphere,L527840,u7806,BETH,How's Harry?
174240,m528,sphere,L527839,u7811,NORMAN,The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
174241,m528,sphere,L527838,u7806,BETH,What do you mean different?
174242,m528,sphere,L527837,u7811,NORMAN,The sphere looks different.
174243,m528,sphere,L527836,u7806,BETH,In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
174244,m528,sphere,L527835,u7811,NORMAN,Where are you?
174245,m528,sphere,L527834,u7806,BETH,What is it Norman?
174246,m528,sphere,L527829,u7806,BETH,You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
174247,m528,sphere,L527828,u7811,NORMAN,Not believing you.
174248,m528,sphere,L527827,u7806,BETH,For what?
174249,m528,sphere,L527826,u7811,NORMAN,I'm sorry.
174250,m528,sphere,L527815,u7806,BETH,Only lab rats.  Here.
174251,m528,sphere,L527814,u7811,NORMAN,Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
174252,m528,sphere,L527813,u7806,BETH,You ever given an injection before.
174253,m528,sphere,L527812,u7806,BETH,Look it's either him or us Norman. Another attack and we go down with this place.
174254,m528,sphere,L527811,u7811,NORMAN,You want to kill him?
174255,m528,sphere,L527810,u7806,BETH,To be on the safe side.  I mean --
174256,m528,sphere,L527809,u7811,NORMAN,Beth --
174257,m528,sphere,L527808,u7806,BETH,It's an idea.
174258,m528,sphere,L527806,u7806,BETH,What if it takes 20 minutes Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
174259,m528,sphere,L527805,u7811,NORMAN,Doesn't say.
174260,m528,sphere,L527804,u7806,BETH,How fast does it take effect?
174261,m528,sphere,L527803,u7811,NORMAN,What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
174262,m528,sphere,L527802,u7806,BETH,I'll just boost the doses.
174263,m528,sphere,L527801,u7811,NORMAN,Three to six hours.
174264,m528,sphere,L527800,u7806,BETH,How long does it last?
174265,m528,sphere,L527796,u7811,NORMAN,It's like a sleeping pill?
174266,m528,sphere,L527795,u7806,BETH,Causes sleep.
174267,m528,sphere,L527794,u7811,NORMAN,What's that?
174268,m528,sphere,L527793,u7806,BETH,It's a soporific.
174269,m528,sphere,L527792,u7811,NORMAN,P-a-r-a-s-o...
174270,m528,sphere,L527791,u7806,BETH,How do you spell it?
174271,m528,sphere,L527790,u7811,NORMAN,Parasolutrine?
174272,m528,sphere,L527789,u7806,BETH,Antibiotic.
174273,m528,sphere,L527788,u7811,NORMAN,Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
174274,m528,sphere,L527787,u7806,BETH,Antihistamine.  For bites.
174275,m528,sphere,L527786,u7811,NORMAN,Riordan?
174276,m528,sphere,L527784,u7811,NORMAN,Bingo.
174277,m528,sphere,L527783,u7806,BETH,Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
174278,m528,sphere,L527782,u7811,NORMAN,Tarazine?
174279,m528,sphere,L527781,u7806,BETH,Nothing about drowsiness.
174280,m528,sphere,L527780,u7811,NORMAN,Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
174281,m528,sphere,L527779,u7806,BETH,A synthetic opium analogue.
174282,m528,sphere,L527778,u7811,NORMAN,Sintag.
174283,m528,sphere,L527777,u7806,BETH,Ulcers.
174284,m528,sphere,L527776,u7811,NORMAN,Valdomet.
174285,m528,sphere,L527775,u7806,BETH,It's for motion sickness.
174286,m528,sphere,L527774,u7811,NORMAN,Ephedrine hydrochloride.
174287,m528,sphere,L527773,u7806,BETH,Something for burns.
174288,m528,sphere,L527772,u7811,NORMAN,Diphenyl parlene.
174289,m528,sphere,L527744,u7806,BETH,Why would Harry go back to using a code?
174290,m528,sphere,L527743,u7811,NORMAN,Looks like some sort of code.
174291,m528,sphere,L527742,u7811,NORMAN,Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
174292,m528,sphere,L527741,u7806,BETH,And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
174293,m528,sphere,L527740,u7811,NORMAN,No.  I mean we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature you know?  I mean we can think and believe and desire whatever we want but there's a part of us -- a shadow side as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.
174294,m528,sphere,L527739,u7806,BETH,His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears can you?
174295,m528,sphere,L527738,u7811,NORMAN,He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
174296,m528,sphere,L527737,u7806,BETH,But why is he doing it?
174297,m528,sphere,L527736,u7811,NORMAN,It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
174298,m528,sphere,L527735,u7806,BETH,Which I told Barnes was attacking --
174299,m528,sphere,L527734,u7811,NORMAN,I don't know Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
174300,m528,sphere,L527733,u7806,BETH,How can the sphere do that?
174301,m528,sphere,L527732,u7811,NORMAN,I don't know.
174302,m528,sphere,L527731,u7806,BETH,But how?
174303,m528,sphere,L527730,u7811,NORMAN,He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
174304,m528,sphere,L527729,u7806,BETH,You think in the sphere --
174305,m528,sphere,L527728,u7811,NORMAN,When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
174306,m528,sphere,L527727,u7806,BETH,What do you mean a part of Harry?
174307,m528,sphere,L527724,u7806,BETH,What?
174308,m528,sphere,L527723,u7811,NORMAN,He translated it wrong.
174309,m528,sphere,L527721,u7806,BETH,Manifested?
174310,m528,sphere,L527720,u7811,NORMAN,After the attack a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape and Jerry said he manifested him.
174311,m528,sphere,L527716,u7806,BETH,Squids?
174312,m528,sphere,L527713,u7806,BETH,What?
174313,m528,sphere,L527712,u7811,NORMAN,Page 87.
174314,m528,sphere,L527709,u7806,BETH,Damn it Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
174315,m528,sphere,L527708,u7811,NORMAN,I don't know Beth.  I wasn't there.
174316,m528,sphere,L527707,u7806,BETH,You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
174317,m528,sphere,L527706,u7811,NORMAN,This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
174318,m528,sphere,L527705,u7806,BETH,Damn it Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
174319,m528,sphere,L527704,u7811,NORMAN,All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
174320,m528,sphere,L527703,u7806,BETH,You don't believe me.
174321,m528,sphere,L527702,u7811,NORMAN,You think?
174322,m528,sphere,L527701,u7806,BETH,No it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
174323,m528,sphere,L527700,u7811,NORMAN,Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
174324,m528,sphere,L527699,u7806,BETH,None of this was here before.
174325,m528,sphere,L527698,u7811,NORMAN,1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
174326,m528,sphere,L527697,u7806,BETH,Wait a second --
174327,m528,sphere,L527696,u7811,NORMAN,We must've had it delivered then.
174328,m528,sphere,L527695,u7806,BETH,That wasn't in there before.
174329,m528,sphere,L527694,u7811,NORMAN,It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
174330,m528,sphere,L527693,u7806,BETH,The refridgerator.
174331,m528,sphere,L527692,u7811,NORMAN,The refridgerator.
174332,m528,sphere,L527691,u7806,BETH,Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
174333,m528,sphere,L527690,u7811,NORMAN,Fixing it.
174334,m528,sphere,L527689,u7806,BETH,What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
174335,m528,sphere,L527688,u7811,NORMAN,I think so Beth.  Yes.
174336,m528,sphere,L527687,u7806,BETH,You get it straightened out?
174337,m528,sphere,L527676,u7811,NORMAN,He what?
174338,m528,sphere,L527675,u7806,BETH,Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
174339,m528,sphere,L527674,u7811,NORMAN,Yeah well I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
174340,m528,sphere,L527673,u7806,BETH,Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
174341,m528,sphere,L527672,u7811,NORMAN,What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
174342,m528,sphere,L527671,u7806,BETH,... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
174343,m528,sphere,L527649,u7806,BETH,Still clear.
174344,m528,sphere,L527648,u7811,NORMAN,Still clear?
174345,m528,sphere,L527647,u7806,BETH,You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
174346,m528,sphere,L527646,u7811,NORMAN,My air isn't... I'm coming back.
174347,m528,sphere,L527645,u7806,BETH,Yes Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
174348,m528,sphere,L527644,u7811,NORMAN,You fixed this suit?  Beth?
174349,m528,sphere,L527643,u7806,BETH,What's the matter?
174350,m528,sphere,L527642,u7806,BETH,Still clear.
174351,m528,sphere,L527641,u7811,NORMAN,I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
174352,m528,sphere,L527640,u7806,BETH,The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
174353,m528,sphere,L527637,u7806,BETH,You press a button Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on Norman...
174354,m528,sphere,L527636,u7811,NORMAN,But I don't know how --
174355,m528,sphere,L527635,u7806,BETH,You don't trust me?
174356,m528,sphere,L527634,u7811,NORMAN,You fixed my suit?
174357,m528,sphere,L527633,u7806,BETH,I fixed your suit.
174358,m528,sphere,L527632,u7811,NORMAN,I would.  But my suit --
174359,m528,sphere,L527631,u7806,BETH,I don't trust Harry to do it.
174360,m528,sphere,L527630,u7811,NORMAN,In case you die too?
174361,m528,sphere,L527629,u7806,BETH,You should know how it works.  Just in case.
174362,m528,sphere,L527628,u7811,NORMAN,Why should I go?
174363,m528,sphere,L527627,u7806,BETH,Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
174364,m528,sphere,L527626,u7806,BETH,Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now we'd pop like a soda bottle.
174365,m528,sphere,L527625,u7811,NORMAN,Four days?
174366,m528,sphere,L527624,u7806,BETH,We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
174367,m528,sphere,L527623,u7811,NORMAN,Wake him then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
174368,m528,sphere,L527622,u7806,BETH,You me and Harry.  He's asleep.
174369,m528,sphere,L527621,u7811,NORMAN,You me and Harry?
174370,m528,sphere,L527620,u7806,BETH,It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
174371,m528,sphere,L527619,u7811,NORMAN,It's not worth the risk.
174372,m528,sphere,L527618,u7806,BETH,Don't bother me Norman.
174373,m528,sphere,L527617,u7811,NORMAN,Forget the sub.
174374,m528,sphere,L527616,u7806,BETH,I have to reset the sub.
174375,m528,sphere,L527615,u7811,NORMAN,Where are you going in such a hurry?
174376,m528,sphere,L527517,u7806,BETH,No I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right Norman?  Stay calm.
174377,m528,sphere,L527516,u7811,NORMAN,Beth --
174378,m528,sphere,L527515,u7806,BETH,Yeah okay.  Sure Norman.
174379,m528,sphere,L527514,u7811,NORMAN,Beth I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright?
174380,m528,sphere,L527513,u7806,BETH,You bastard.
174381,m528,sphere,L527512,u7811,NORMAN,Don't do this.
174382,m528,sphere,L527511,u7806,BETH,You did didn't you?
174383,m528,sphere,L527510,u7811,NORMAN,Beth --
174384,m528,sphere,L527509,u7806,BETH,You told him about me?
174385,m528,sphere,L527508,u7811,NORMAN,What?
174386,m528,sphere,L527507,u7806,BETH,You said something to him didn't you?
174387,m528,sphere,L527506,u7811,NORMAN,It's done alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now okay?
174388,m528,sphere,L527505,u7806,BETH,Don't tell me to calm down!
174389,m528,sphere,L527504,u7811,NORMAN,Calm down Beth.  Alright?
174390,m528,sphere,L527503,u7806,BETH,He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
174391,m528,sphere,L527502,u7811,NORMAN,You went through Edmunds' things?
174392,m528,sphere,L527501,u7806,BETH,In Edmunds' things.
174393,m528,sphere,L527500,u7811,NORMAN,Where did you get this?
174394,m528,sphere,L527498,u7806,BETH,Fuck you Norman!  It's right here...
174395,m528,sphere,L527497,u7811,NORMAN,You're jumping to conclusions Beth. Don't get worked up --
174396,m528,sphere,L527496,u7806,BETH,So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
174397,m528,sphere,L527495,u7811,NORMAN,So what?
174398,m528,sphere,L527494,u7806,BETH,Yeah he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four five minutes before they cleared out.
174399,m528,sphere,L527493,u7811,NORMAN,C'mon Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
174400,m528,sphere,L527492,u7806,BETH,... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
174401,m528,sphere,L527470,u7806,BETH,Eggs.
174402,m528,sphere,L527469,u7811,NORMAN,What are they?
174403,m528,sphere,L527468,u7806,BETH,Norman.
174404,m528,sphere,L527462,u7811,NORMAN,What could have done this?
174405,m528,sphere,L527461,u7806,BETH,She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
174406,m528,sphere,L527460,u7811,NORMAN,I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
174407,m528,sphere,L527320,u7811,NORMAN,Beth.
174408,m528,sphere,L527319,u7806,BETH,I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
174409,m528,sphere,L527318,u7811,NORMAN,Beth --
174410,m528,sphere,L527317,u7806,BETH,Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
174411,m528,sphere,L527316,u7811,NORMAN,Beth.
174412,m528,sphere,L527315,u7806,BETH,What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
174413,m528,sphere,L527314,u7811,NORMAN,They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
174414,m528,sphere,L527313,u7806,BETH,I mean I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
174415,m528,sphere,L527312,u7811,NORMAN,Beth --
174416,m528,sphere,L527311,u7806,BETH,What?  Why...
174417,m528,sphere,L527310,u7811,NORMAN,And you didn't tell anyone?
174418,m528,sphere,L527309,u7806,BETH,Yeah why?
174419,m528,sphere,L527308,u7811,NORMAN,You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
174420,m528,sphere,L527307,u7806,BETH,What?
174421,m528,sphere,L527306,u7811,NORMAN,Wait a minute.
174422,m528,sphere,L527305,u7806,BETH,They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
174423,m528,sphere,L527304,u7811,NORMAN,What do you mean -- not normal?
174424,m528,sphere,L527303,u7806,BETH,Normally I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships no divers no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
174425,m528,sphere,L527302,u7811,NORMAN,Me?  Well I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while but I survived.  Beth do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
174426,m528,sphere,L527301,u7806,BETH,What about you?  What happened to you?
174427,m528,sphere,L527300,u7811,NORMAN,Yeah it was awful.
174428,m528,sphere,L527299,u7806,BETH,My gosh Norman.
174429,m528,sphere,L527298,u7811,NORMAN,... when I was six my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging and when we came out of the water he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
174430,m528,sphere,L527297,u7811,NORMAN,No thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
174431,m528,sphere,L527296,u7806,BETH,A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman come here look at this.
174432,m528,sphere,L527295,u7811,NORMAN,We have a library?
174433,m528,sphere,L527294,u7806,BETH,The library.
174434,m528,sphere,L527293,u7811,NORMAN,Where'd this come from?
174435,m528,sphere,L527119,u7811,NORMAN,Disrupt our brain waves interfere with our ability to think.
174436,m528,sphere,L527118,u7806,BETH,It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
174437,m528,sphere,L527058,u7811,NORMAN,Get this thing off me.
174438,m528,sphere,L527057,u7806,BETH,Norman!
174439,m528,sphere,L527028,u7806,BETH,Good theory Ted.
174440,m528,sphere,L527027,u7811,NORMAN,400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
174441,m528,sphere,L526957,u7806,BETH,Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
174442,m528,sphere,L526956,u7811,NORMAN,No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
174443,m528,sphere,L526955,u7806,BETH,You're next Norman.
174444,m528,sphere,L526954,u7811,NORMAN,Yeah.  Drowning.
174445,m528,sphere,L526953,u7806,BETH,Isn't there a psychological term for that Dr. Johnson?
174446,m528,sphere,L526876,u7811,NORMAN,What -- are you threatening me?
174447,m528,sphere,L526875,u7806,BETH,Just keep your mouth shut alright? This could mean everything to our careers you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
174448,m528,sphere,L526874,u7811,NORMAN,The timing has never seemed quite right.
174449,m528,sphere,L526873,u7806,BETH,Well let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
174450,m528,sphere,L526872,u7811,NORMAN,It never occurred to me.
174451,m528,sphere,L526871,u7806,BETH,Well you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water Norman.  That's first grade geography.
174452,m528,sphere,L526870,u7811,NORMAN,We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
174453,m528,sphere,L526869,u7806,BETH,What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
174454,m528,sphere,L526868,u7811,NORMAN,Underwater?
174455,m528,sphere,L526867,u7806,BETH,To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
174456,m528,sphere,L526866,u7811,NORMAN,Wait -- down where?
174457,m528,sphere,L526865,u7806,BETH,Because when we get down there --
174458,m528,sphere,L526864,u7811,NORMAN,C'mon Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
174459,m528,sphere,L526863,u7806,BETH,Do yourself a favor Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
174460,m528,sphere,L526862,u7811,NORMAN,I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea --
174461,m528,sphere,L526861,u7806,BETH,That's quite a secret.
174462,m528,sphere,L526860,u7811,NORMAN,It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
174463,m528,sphere,L526859,u7806,BETH,I've read it twice Norman.  It's brilliant.
174464,m528,sphere,L526858,u7811,NORMAN,That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
174465,m528,sphere,L526857,u7806,BETH,I love secrets.
174466,m528,sphere,L526856,u7811,NORMAN,Beth look can I trust you with a little secret?
174467,m528,sphere,L527406,u7806,BETH,Who says it's a he?
174468,m528,sphere,L527405,u7814,TED,He doesn't wait for an answer.
174469,m528,sphere,L527195,u7814,TED,By the bunks.
174470,m528,sphere,L527194,u7806,BETH,Norman?  Where's Norman?
174471,m528,sphere,L527030,u7806,BETH,I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
174472,m528,sphere,L527029,u7814,TED,Well what's your theory?
174473,m528,sphere,L527018,u7814,TED,It doesn't make any sense.
174474,m528,sphere,L527017,u7806,BETH,I don't get it.
174475,m528,sphere,L527002,u7814,TED,Well they're not mine.
174476,m528,sphere,L527001,u7806,BETH,Well think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
174477,m528,sphere,L527000,u7814,TED,No.  I don't think so.
174478,m528,sphere,L526900,u7806,BETH,What's that -- mistake number two Norman?
174479,m528,sphere,L526899,u7814,TED,Pussy.
174480,m528,sphere,L528063,u7809,HARRY,Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
174481,m528,sphere,L528062,u7806,BETH,We can refuse to talk.
174482,m528,sphere,L528061,u7809,HARRY,They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
174483,m528,sphere,L527766,u7809,HARRY,Yes you are...
174484,m528,sphere,L527765,u7806,BETH,No I'm not.  I'm not star--
174485,m528,sphere,L527764,u7809,HARRY,You're staring at me.
174486,m528,sphere,L527763,u7806,BETH,Like what?  I'm not --
174487,m528,sphere,L527762,u7809,HARRY,Why are you looking at me like that?
174488,m528,sphere,L527761,u7809,HARRY,Another attack?
174489,m528,sphere,L527760,u7806,BETH,Our habitat I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
174490,m528,sphere,L527759,u7809,HARRY,Just in time for what?
174491,m528,sphere,L527758,u7806,BETH,What?
174492,m528,sphere,L527757,u7809,HARRY,In time for what?
174493,m528,sphere,L527756,u7806,BETH,Just in time too.
174494,m528,sphere,L527749,u7809,HARRY,Yeah I don't know how you could make that confusion.
174495,m528,sphere,L527748,u7806,BETH,I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
174496,m528,sphere,L527747,u7809,HARRY,That's a hell of a mistake to make Beth.
174497,m528,sphere,L527746,u7806,BETH,Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry didn't I?
174498,m528,sphere,L527681,u7806,BETH,Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
174499,m528,sphere,L527680,u7809,HARRY,We never even had a conversation Norman.
174500,m528,sphere,L527679,u7806,BETH,Yes you did.  Norman I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
174501,m528,sphere,L527678,u7809,HARRY,I never said that.
174502,m528,sphere,L527677,u7806,BETH,When he woke up he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
174503,m528,sphere,L527103,u7809,HARRY,Cannibalism to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
174504,m528,sphere,L527102,u7806,BETH,Take politics our views on abortion the death penalty...
174505,m528,sphere,L527054,u7809,HARRY,A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
174506,m528,sphere,L527053,u7806,BETH,What are you looking for?
174507,m528,sphere,L527037,u7809,HARRY,It's an American spacecraft.
174508,m528,sphere,L527036,u7806,BETH,Then what is it?
174509,m528,sphere,L527005,u7809,HARRY,You'd have to ask them.
174510,m528,sphere,L527004,u7806,BETH,It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
174511,m528,sphere,L526943,u7806,BETH,For whoever's in that thing.
174512,m528,sphere,L526942,u7809,HARRY,For who?  The fish?
174513,m528,sphere,L526941,u7806,BETH,All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
174514,m528,sphere,L526940,u7809,HARRY,Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
174516,m528,sphere,L527262,u7811,NORMAN,Is it coming from our own computer?
174518,m528,sphere,L527260,u7811,NORMAN,Where's it coming from?
174520,m528,sphere,L527258,u7811,NORMAN,When did it come across?
174521,m528,sphere,L528068,u7811,NORMAN,It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
174522,m528,sphere,L528067,u7809,HARRY,You mean forget?
174523,m528,sphere,L528066,u7811,NORMAN,The power allows us to manifest our fears right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
174524,m528,sphere,L528065,u7809,HARRY,We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry Beth.
174525,m528,sphere,L528064,u7811,NORMAN,There is one possibility.
174526,m528,sphere,L528055,u7809,HARRY,No.  I don't.  But I always said to myself when I die I want to die laughing.
174527,m528,sphere,L528054,u7811,NORMAN,Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
174528,m528,sphere,L528053,u7809,HARRY,How's that working out by the way?
174529,m528,sphere,L528049,u7809,HARRY,It's not fast enough Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
174530,m528,sphere,L528048,u7811,NORMAN,Nine hundred feet to surface.
174531,m528,sphere,L528047,u7809,HARRY,Less than a minute we're never gonna make it.

174533,m528,sphere,L528042,u7809,HARRY,Well press something!
174534,m528,sphere,L528041,u7811,NORMAN,No idea.
174535,m528,sphere,L528040,u7809,HARRY,You know how to work this thing?
174536,m528,sphere,L528038,u7809,HARRY,I'm trying.  There.
174537,m528,sphere,L528037,u7811,NORMAN,Get her out of the seat I need room to sit.  Harry?

174539,m528,sphere,L528035,u7809,HARRY,Her legs are in the way.
174540,m528,sphere,L528034,u7811,NORMAN,Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry work with me here!
174541,m528,sphere,L528033,u7809,HARRY,Gimme a second --
174542,m528,sphere,L528032,u7811,NORMAN,I'm trying to keep balance with --
174543,m528,sphere,L528031,u7809,HARRY,C'mon Norman!
174544,m528,sphere,L528024,u7811,NORMAN,Shut up and catch.
174545,m528,sphere,L528023,u7809,HARRY,Three fifty-six three fifty-five three --
174546,m528,sphere,L528022,u7811,NORMAN,I heard!  I heard!
174547,m528,sphere,L528021,u7809,HARRY,Hurry Norman.  Four minutes.
174548,m528,sphere,L528020,u7811,NORMAN,Hold on.
174549,m528,sphere,L528018,u7811,NORMAN,Are you trying damn it?  Just --
174550,m528,sphere,L528017,u7809,HARRY,Missed.
174551,m528,sphere,L528016,u7811,NORMAN,I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
174552,m528,sphere,L528015,u7809,HARRY,Push her c'mon.
174553,m528,sphere,L528014,u7811,NORMAN,Hold on.
174554,m528,sphere,L528013,u7809,HARRY,I can't reach her.
174555,m528,sphere,L528007,u7809,HARRY,How far away's the sub?
174556,m528,sphere,L528006,u7811,NORMAN,Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
174557,m528,sphere,L528005,u7809,HARRY,How much time you figure to get to the surface?
174558,m528,sphere,L528004,u7811,NORMAN,Shut up and open the door.
174559,m528,sphere,L528003,u7809,HARRY,We're never gonna make it.
174560,m528,sphere,L528002,u7811,NORMAN,Help me lift her.
174561,m528,sphere,L528001,u7809,HARRY,Fine.
174562,m528,sphere,L527996,u7809,HARRY,I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
174563,m528,sphere,L527995,u7811,NORMAN,I don't think so.
174564,m528,sphere,L527994,u7809,HARRY,Did I kill her?
174565,m528,sphere,L527823,u7809,HARRY,Stop what?  What are you -- ?
174566,m528,sphere,L527822,u7811,NORMAN,It's the squid!  Stop it!
174567,m528,sphere,L527821,u7811,NORMAN,You know what it is Harry.
174568,m528,sphere,L527820,u7809,HARRY,What is it?
174569,m528,sphere,L527771,u7809,HARRY,Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
174570,m528,sphere,L527770,u7811,NORMAN,That's right.
174571,m528,sphere,L527769,u7809,HARRY,The three of us.
174572,m528,sphere,L527768,u7811,NORMAN,We just figured you know the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
174573,m528,sphere,L527754,u7809,HARRY,Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
174574,m528,sphere,L527753,u7811,NORMAN,How do we decode it?
174575,m528,sphere,L527752,u7809,HARRY,Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
174576,m528,sphere,L527751,u7811,NORMAN,Wisconsin?
174577,m528,sphere,L527750,u7809,HARRY,Wisconsin's your answer.
174578,m528,sphere,L527686,u7809,HARRY,She's lying Norman.  Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
174579,m528,sphere,L527685,u7811,NORMAN,But why would she -- ?
174580,m528,sphere,L527684,u7809,HARRY,I was just in the cafeteria there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
174581,m528,sphere,L527683,u7811,NORMAN,You didn't say that about the food?
174582,m528,sphere,L527682,u7809,HARRY,She's cracking Norman.
174583,m528,sphere,L527670,u7809,HARRY,I thought she was with you.
174584,m528,sphere,L527669,u7811,NORMAN,Beth left?
174585,m528,sphere,L527668,u7809,HARRY,Her suit's gone.
174586,m528,sphere,L527667,u7811,NORMAN,She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
174587,m528,sphere,L527666,u7809,HARRY,When I woke up nobody was here.
174588,m528,sphere,L527665,u7811,NORMAN,What do you mean?  She's not here?
174589,m528,sphere,L527664,u7809,HARRY,What happened to her?
174590,m528,sphere,L527663,u7811,NORMAN,Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
174591,m528,sphere,L527661,u7809,HARRY,You're clear.  You see the airlock?
174592,m528,sphere,L527660,u7811,NORMAN,I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
174593,m528,sphere,L527659,u7809,HARRY,Norman where are you?
174594,m528,sphere,L527658,u7811,NORMAN,Harry?
174595,m528,sphere,L527657,u7809,HARRY,... you there?  Norman?
174596,m528,sphere,L527271,u7809,HARRY,I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing seeing smelling. Like I can smell your sheets Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal really isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
174597,m528,sphere,L527270,u7811,NORMAN,You don't remember that?
174598,m528,sphere,L527269,u7809,HARRY,Did I?
174599,m528,sphere,L527268,u7811,NORMAN,You said something to me before -- about how we were all going to die.
174600,m528,sphere,L527267,u7809,HARRY,Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
174601,m528,sphere,L527266,u7811,NORMAN,Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry what happened in the cafeteria?
174602,m528,sphere,L527265,u7809,HARRY,There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
174603,m528,sphere,L527264,u7811,NORMAN,Getting anywhere with those?
174604,m528,sphere,L527255,u7809,HARRY,What are they?
174605,m528,sphere,L527254,u7811,NORMAN,These aren't half bad Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
174606,m528,sphere,L527243,u7811,NORMAN,That far in what Harry?
174607,m528,sphere,L527242,u7809,HARRY,I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
174608,m528,sphere,L527241,u7811,NORMAN,Page 87 of what Harry?
174609,m528,sphere,L527240,u7809,HARRY,What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
174610,m528,sphere,L527239,u7811,NORMAN,What is it Harry?
174611,m528,sphere,L527238,u7809,HARRY,Norman?
174612,m528,sphere,L527237,u7811,NORMAN,Then explain it to me.
174613,m528,sphere,L527236,u7809,HARRY,You don't understand about the sphere.
174614,m528,sphere,L527235,u7811,NORMAN,Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
174615,m528,sphere,L527234,u7809,HARRY,You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
174616,m528,sphere,L527233,u7811,NORMAN,You remember opening the door?
174617,m528,sphere,L527232,u7809,HARRY,What are you still doing here?
174618,m528,sphere,L527231,u7811,NORMAN,Harry can you tell me about the sphere?
174619,m528,sphere,L527230,u7809,HARRY,It's like...
174620,m528,sphere,L527229,u7811,NORMAN,What noise?
174621,m528,sphere,L527228,u7809,HARRY,What is that?  That noise?
174622,m528,sphere,L527141,u7809,HARRY,Curious isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die I'd sure like to open it and see.
174623,m528,sphere,L527140,u7811,NORMAN,It's what's in that sphere isn't it Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
174624,m528,sphere,L527139,u7809,HARRY,Then what Norman?
174625,m528,sphere,L527138,u7811,NORMAN,No.  I didn't say that.
174626,m528,sphere,L527137,u7809,HARRY,You mean you think I'm cracking?
174627,m528,sphere,L527136,u7811,NORMAN,Look -- we're under a lot of pressure we're tired you're not thinking straight.
174628,m528,sphere,L527135,u7809,HARRY,Am I?
174629,m528,sphere,L527134,u7811,NORMAN,I can't.  If I had a minute to think maybe but I know you're wrong.
174630,m528,sphere,L527133,u7809,HARRY,Gimme another explanation.
174631,m528,sphere,L527132,u7811,NORMAN,I can't believe that Harry.
174632,m528,sphere,L527131,u7809,HARRY,Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
174633,m528,sphere,L527130,u7811,NORMAN,Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
174634,m528,sphere,L527129,u7809,HARRY,So <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface we'd tell someone about the black hole wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
174635,m528,sphere,L527128,u7811,NORMAN,So what?
174636,m528,sphere,L527126,u7811,NORMAN,I don't follow you.
174637,m528,sphere,L527125,u7809,HARRY,A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
174638,m528,sphere,L527124,u7811,NORMAN,Not a clue.
174639,m528,sphere,L527123,u7809,HARRY,I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
174640,m528,sphere,L527122,u7811,NORMAN,Don't be so optomistic Harry.
174641,m528,sphere,L527112,u7811,NORMAN,Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about but good point.
174642,m528,sphere,L527111,u7809,HARRY,And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
174643,m528,sphere,L527099,u7809,HARRY,Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human it's a reptile or a big insect or something having human values human understanding.
174644,m528,sphere,L527098,u7811,NORMAN,I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?
174645,m528,sphere,L527081,u7809,HARRY,Our present.
174646,m528,sphere,L527080,u7811,NORMAN,But on the way home they miss their turn go too far into the past.
174647,m528,sphere,L527079,u7809,HARRY,This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
174648,m528,sphere,L527078,u7811,NORMAN,Which one?  Let me get the list out.
174649,m528,sphere,L527077,u7809,HARRY,This answers one of our questions.
174650,m528,sphere,L527070,u7809,HARRY,Time travel.  A black hole.
174651,m528,sphere,L527069,u7811,NORMAN,To what?
174652,m528,sphere,L527068,u7809,HARRY,Our answer.
174653,m528,sphere,L527061,u7811,NORMAN,Whatever I can do to help.
174654,m528,sphere,L527060,u7809,HARRY,Nice work Norman.
174655,m528,sphere,L526964,u7811,NORMAN,Look would you --
174656,m528,sphere,L526963,u7809,HARRY,C'mon Norman.
174657,m528,sphere,L526961,u7811,NORMAN,Wait a second I --
174658,m528,sphere,L526960,u7809,HARRY,C'mon.
174659,m528,sphere,L526959,u7811,NORMAN,No why don't --
174660,m528,sphere,L526958,u7809,HARRY,Go ahead.  Ladies first.
174661,m528,sphere,L526910,u7811,NORMAN,I'm fine.
174662,m528,sphere,L526909,u7809,HARRY,You sound defensive.
174663,m528,sphere,L526908,u7811,NORMAN,I'm not being defensive.
174664,m528,sphere,L526907,u7809,HARRY,Don't be defensive.
174665,m528,sphere,L526906,u7811,NORMAN,Fine.  I'm fine.
174666,m528,sphere,L526905,u7809,HARRY,You holding up alright?
174667,m528,sphere,L526904,u7811,NORMAN,What?
174668,m528,sphere,L526903,u7809,HARRY,How are you feeling Norman?
174669,m528,sphere,L527444,u7814,TED,Don't gimme that psychology bullshit Norman.  Psychology isn't a science it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this emotions don't mean shit.
174670,m528,sphere,L527394,u7814,TED,Thank you.
174671,m528,sphere,L527393,u7809,HARRY,Good idea Ted.
174672,m528,sphere,L527387,u7814,TED,What'd you say?
174673,m528,sphere,L527370,u7809,HARRY,Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
174674,m528,sphere,L527369,u7814,TED,See?  No code.  What'd I say?
174675,m528,sphere,L527368,u7809,HARRY,... I asked myself why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate why use a code?
174676,m528,sphere,L527351,u7814,TED,Yeah I'll work on it too.
174677,m528,sphere,L527350,u7809,HARRY,If it is a message it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
174678,m528,sphere,L527347,u7814,TED,It's not a discharge.  Right Edmunds?  You said before right?  So it's gotta be a message.
174679,m528,sphere,L527346,u7809,HARRY,Well if it's a discharge --
174680,m528,sphere,L527253,u7814,TED,Impotent?  I'm not impotent.
174681,m528,sphere,L527252,u7809,HARRY,Salt's good for you Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
174682,m528,sphere,L527251,u7814,TED,Hey go easy on the salt will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
174683,m528,sphere,L527085,u7809,HARRY,Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
174684,m528,sphere,L527084,u7814,TED,Looks like a design some writing maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
174685,m528,sphere,L527049,u7809,HARRY,Not where.  When.  400 years ago.  From our future.
174686,m528,sphere,L527048,u7814,TED,Arrived?  From where?
174687,m528,sphere,L527047,u7809,HARRY,It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
174688,m528,sphere,L527046,u7814,TED,Please.  It must have flown here --
174689,m528,sphere,L527045,u7809,HARRY,Meaning it didn't land in the water.
174690,m528,sphere,L527044,u7814,TED,Meaning?
174691,m528,sphere,L527043,u7809,HARRY,We take a weeny little wedge bang on it a couple of times and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
174692,m528,sphere,L527039,u7809,HARRY,It's been obvious from the start hasn't it Captain?  That's why all the secrecy why no one was told about it?
174693,m528,sphere,L527038,u7814,TED,An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah good theory Harry.
174694,m528,sphere,L527035,u7809,HARRY,Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
174695,m528,sphere,L527034,u7814,TED,If it is an alien spacecraft --
174696,m528,sphere,L527033,u7809,HARRY,Do you?
174697,m528,sphere,L527032,u7814,TED,Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
174698,m528,sphere,L527031,u7809,HARRY,All the facts you need are right in front of you.
174699,m528,sphere,L527026,u7814,TED,Unless this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
174700,m528,sphere,L527025,u7809,HARRY,Think about it.
174701,m528,sphere,L527024,u7814,TED,Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
174702,m528,sphere,L527023,u7809,HARRY,Is it?
174703,m528,sphere,L527022,u7814,TED,But it's impossible.
174704,m528,sphere,L527021,u7809,HARRY,A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
174705,m528,sphere,L527020,u7814,TED,Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
174706,m528,sphere,L527019,u7809,HARRY,You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
174707,m528,sphere,L527016,u7809,HARRY,That's right.
174708,m528,sphere,L527015,u7814,TED,English?

174710,m528,sphere,L526970,u7814,TED,Alot like.  You know I noticed it before but I didn't...
174711,m528,sphere,L526968,u7814,TED,Gimme some room here will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.

You don't remember a gun to your head which glasses you have on.  And you have a fertile imagination.  Imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  If you aren't <u>sure</u> then they have nothing.  Bob walks free.  As he should.  Joe:  wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart.  You know?  The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them we fear them. And they fear us.  Because we tell the truth.  About our lives.  Now this is a damn roust and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case he wants to make a name for himself.  If we let him do that if we let him do that then we're being false to our community...to our community you understand...?  To our world.  Cause you are a part of that world now.  You have to take off the Steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.  And be part of your world.  I got a five picture deal with the studio.  And you stick with me.  You write one two more you stick with me and you'll <u>direct</u> the third one.  You are a part of this world. It's in your blood.  It's you.  You have to do the right thing:  we're out in the Provinces the Sheriff <u>literally</u> is at our door.  You have to stand with the troops Joe.  That's the bottom line. You <u>have</u> to...if you had the leisure to think it through you'd see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in the car.
175982,m532,state and main,L548706,u7869,JOE,You want me to lie.

176096,m532,state and main,L548043,u7877,WALT,Like dykes and dogs.
176097,m532,state and main,L548042,u7870,MARTY,How are you getting on with these fine people?
176098,m532,state and main,L548041,u7877,WALT,That's what I said.
176099,m532,state and main,L548040,u7870,MARTY,<u>Stop</u>...

176106,m532,state and main,L548028,u7870,MARTY,We're flying over pigs we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
176107,m532,state and main,L548027,u7877,WALT,How was your flight?
176108,m532,state and main,L548026,u7870,MARTY,What'd you do <u>build</u> this...?
176109,m532,state and main,L548025,u7877,WALT,Oh yeah I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...

176111,m532,state and main,L548023,u7877,WALT,I left that for you.
176112,m532,state and main,L548022,u7870,MARTY,You cool the broad out?

176147,m532,state and main,L547935,u7877,WALT,No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
176148,m532,state and main,L547933,u7877,WALT,Why?
176150,m532,state and main,L547929,u7877,WALT,We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
176152,m532,state and main,L547512,u7877,WALT,...we can't lose the wind...

176156,m533,stepmom,L549544,u7878,ANNABELLE,She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
176157,m533,stepmom,L549543,u7879,BEN,I'd rather be with Mommy.
176158,m533,stepmom,L549523,u7879,BEN,Mommy's marrying Rache!
176159,m533,stepmom,L549522,u7878,ANNABELLE,So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
176160,m533,stepmom,L549126,u7879,BEN,I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
176161,m533,stepmom,L549125,u7878,ANNABELLE,Guinevere Godiva I sense enemy sol...
176162,m533,stepmom,L549006,u7879,BEN,I killed her!
176163,m533,stepmom,L549005,u7878,ANNABELLE,Ben!  What's wrong?
176164,m533,stepmom,L548984,u7878,ANNABELLE,I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
176165,m533,stepmom,L548983,u7879,BEN,&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
176166,m533,stepmom,L548867,u7878,ANNABELLE,I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
176167,m533,stepmom,L548866,u7879,BEN,I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
176168,m533,stepmom,L548857,u7878,ANNABELLE,I NEVER do that you ALWAYS lie!
176169,m533,stepmom,L548856,u7879,BEN,Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
176170,m533,stepmom,L550073,u7883,JACKIE,Good.  That's very good.
176171,m533,stepmom,L550072,u7878,ANNABELLE,I'll miss you so much.
176172,m533,stepmom,L550071,u7883,JACKIE,Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
176173,m533,stepmom,L550070,u7878,ANNABELLE,Yes.
176174,m533,stepmom,L550069,u7883,JACKIE,Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
176175,m533,stepmom,L550068,u7878,ANNABELLE,Until he's old enough to read.
176176,m533,stepmom,L550067,u7883,JACKIE,Keep Ben's for awhile okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
176177,m533,stepmom,L550064,u7883,JACKIE,Let me be the judge of that.
176178,m533,stepmom,L550063,u7878,ANNABELLE,I'm not.
176179,m533,stepmom,L550062,u7883,JACKIE,Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
176180,m533,stepmom,L550061,u7883,JACKIE,Don't. Take me with you.
176181,m533,stepmom,L550060,u7878,ANNABELLE,I don't want to say goodbye.
176182,m533,stepmom,L549749,u7883,JACKIE,No that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth.
176183,m533,stepmom,L549748,u7878,ANNABELLE,And bring my knees up <u>real</u> hard yeh?
176184,m533,stepmom,L549747,u7883,JACKIE,I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow on the lunch yard you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
176185,m533,stepmom,L549746,u7878,ANNABELLE,You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
176186,m533,stepmom,L549745,u7883,JACKIE,Darling I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
176187,m533,stepmom,L549658,u7883,JACKIE,Nothing sweetheart.
176188,m533,stepmom,L549657,u7878,ANNABELLE,Mom?  What's wrong?
176189,m533,stepmom,L549656,u7883,JACKIE,Annabelle...wake up honey...
176190,m533,stepmom,L549625,u7878,ANNABELLE,Maybe twenty.
176191,m533,stepmom,L549624,u7883,JACKIE,How many devilled eggs can you eat?
176192,m533,stepmom,L549623,u7883,JACKIE,Oh yeh.
176193,m533,stepmom,L549622,u7878,ANNABELLE,This'll work huh?
176194,m533,stepmom,L549618,u7878,ANNABELLE,This is a joke right?
176195,m533,stepmom,L549617,u7883,JACKIE,He's not even there.  You don't see him you don't hear him you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
176196,m533,stepmom,L549616,u7883,JACKIE,You have to ignore him.
176197,m533,stepmom,L549615,u7878,ANNABELLE,I call him a fartface or a pervert or something equally lame.
176198,m533,stepmom,L549614,u7883,JACKIE,And what do you do wh...
176199,m533,stepmom,L549613,u7883,JACKIE,Good girl.
176200,m533,stepmom,L549612,u7878,ANNABELLE,Not with my mouth open.
176201,m533,stepmom,L549611,u7883,JACKIE,You wouldn't kiss him huh?
176202,m533,stepmom,L549610,u7878,ANNABELLE,...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess' or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
176203,m533,stepmom,L549609,u7883,JACKIE,You don't like his friends.
176204,m533,stepmom,L549608,u7878,ANNABELLE,Every time I'm on the lunch yard and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
176205,m533,stepmom,L549607,u7883,JACKIE,Actually.  I could only help him.
176206,m533,stepmom,L549606,u7878,ANNABELLE,Great.
176207,m533,stepmom,L549605,u7883,JACKIE,I could help with the debate.
176208,m533,stepmom,L549604,u7878,ANNABELLE,A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
176209,m533,stepmom,L549603,u7883,JACKIE,What's Thursd...
176210,m533,stepmom,L549573,u7883,JACKIE,She is but an arriviste.
176211,m533,stepmom,L549572,u7878,ANNABELLE,She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
176212,m533,stepmom,L549571,u7883,JACKIE,And...?
176213,m533,stepmom,L549570,u7878,ANNABELLE,He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
176214,m533,stepmom,L549564,u7883,JACKIE,...I'm not deaf y'know.
176215,m533,stepmom,L549563,u7878,ANNABELLE,I said...
176216,m533,stepmom,L549562,u7878,ANNABELLE,THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
176217,m533,stepmom,L549561,u7883,JACKIE,I can't hear you.
176218,m533,stepmom,L549542,u7878,ANNABELLE,Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u> we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
176219,m533,stepmom,L549541,u7883,JACKIE,We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other very m...
176220,m533,stepmom,L549539,u7878,ANNABELLE,You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u> maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
176221,m533,stepmom,L549538,u7883,JACKIE,I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best maybe I was wr...
176222,m533,stepmom,L549347,u7883,JACKIE,Secret's safe with me.
176223,m533,stepmom,L549346,u7878,ANNABELLE,And don't tell her I told you.
176224,m533,stepmom,L549345,u7883,JACKIE,I bet.
176225,m533,stepmom,L549344,u7878,ANNABELLE,Actually.  She's kind of cool when you get to know her.
176226,m533,stepmom,L549343,u7878,ANNABELLE,She knows every neat junk food place.
176227,m533,stepmom,L549342,u7883,JACKIE,Like a big sister.
176228,m533,stepmom,L549341,u7878,ANNABELLE,...I mean she knows all the music and pop stars and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid herself.
176229,m533,stepmom,L549337,u7878,ANNABELLE,Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
176230,m533,stepmom,L549336,u7883,JACKIE,I hope it's the right kind.
176231,m533,stepmom,L549330,u7883,JACKIE,Well.  It's for you.
176232,m533,stepmom,L549329,u7878,ANNABELLE,Wow.  Who's that for?
176233,m533,stepmom,L549301,u7878,ANNABELLE,I'll be there for you.
176234,m533,stepmom,L549300,u7883,JACKIE,That happens.  To families.
176235,m533,stepmom,L549297,u7883,JACKIE,Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us.
176236,m533,stepmom,L549296,u7878,ANNABELLE,Like how?
176237,m533,stepmom,L549295,u7883,JACKIE,But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
176238,m533,stepmom,L549288,u7883,JACKIE,Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did.
176239,m533,stepmom,L549287,u7878,ANNABELLE,No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together why sh...
176240,m533,stepmom,L549286,u7883,JACKIE,Look she's upset --
176241,m533,stepmom,L549254,u7878,ANNABELLE,Or blush.  You look pale.
176242,m533,stepmom,L549253,u7883,JACKIE,Well Daddy and I are just friends now and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
176243,m533,stepmom,L549252,u7878,ANNABELLE,But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
176244,m533,stepmom,L549251,u7883,JACKIE,I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
176245,m533,stepmom,L549250,u7878,ANNABELLE,Then why are you putting on mascara?
176246,m533,stepmom,L549249,u7883,JACKIE,Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
176247,m533,stepmom,L549248,u7878,ANNABELLE,What are you gonna talk about?
176248,m533,stepmom,L549247,u7883,JACKIE,Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half it's bedtime...
176249,m533,stepmom,L549187,u7878,ANNABELLE,I like talking about it.  At least to you.
176250,m533,stepmom,L549186,u7883,JACKIE,So why are you asking me?
176251,m533,stepmom,L549185,u7878,ANNABELLE,Because it feels really incredibly good.
176252,m533,stepmom,L549184,u7883,JACKIE,...why do you think?
176253,m533,stepmom,L549183,u7878,ANNABELLE,Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
176254,m533,stepmom,L549182,u7878,ANNABELLE,I live.  In the same country.
176255,m533,stepmom,L549181,u7883,JACKIE,How would you know sh...
176256,m533,stepmom,L549180,u7878,ANNABELLE,During sex.
176257,m533,stepmom,L549179,u7883,JACKIE,Scream.
176258,m533,stepmom,L549178,u7878,ANNABELLE,Why does Rachel scream?
176259,m533,stepmom,L549177,u7883,JACKIE,Well not exactly s...
176260,m533,stepmom,L549176,u7878,ANNABELLE,Sex.  Of course.
176261,m533,stepmom,L549175,u7883,JACKIE,Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
176262,m533,stepmom,L549128,u7878,ANNABELLE,I'll ride ahead.  Nelson protect the Queen...
176263,m533,stepmom,L549127,u7883,JACKIE,Lord Nelson Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
176264,m533,stepmom,L548939,u7883,JACKIE,Annabelle daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
176265,m533,stepmom,L548938,u7878,ANNABELLE,I'm gonna call him.
176266,m533,stepmom,L548935,u7878,ANNABELLE,Never say never you always say that. I'll bet daddy's mad at me now.
176267,m533,stepmom,L548934,u7883,JACKIE,That will never happen.
176268,m533,stepmom,L548933,u7878,ANNABELLE,What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
176269,m533,stepmom,L548932,u7883,JACKIE,It happens.
176270,m533,stepmom,L548931,u7878,ANNABELLE,It just slipped out.
176271,m533,stepmom,L548929,u7883,JACKIE,Well he's not president anymore so why be petty.
176272,m533,stepmom,L548928,u7878,ANNABELLE,Like who?
176273,m533,stepmom,L548927,u7883,JACKIE,Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
176274,m533,stepmom,L548926,u7878,ANNABELLE,I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
176275,m533,stepmom,L548925,u7883,JACKIE,Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
176276,m533,stepmom,L548924,u7878,ANNABELLE,Mass hysteria.
176277,m533,stepmom,L548923,u7883,JACKIE,Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
176278,m533,stepmom,L548922,u7878,ANNABELLE,I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
176279,m533,stepmom,L548921,u7883,JACKIE,Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
176280,m533,stepmom,L548920,u7878,ANNABELLE,I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
176281,m533,stepmom,L548865,u7883,JACKIE,Excellent point.
176282,m533,stepmom,L548864,u7878,ANNABELLE,I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.

176443,m533,stepmom,L549639,u7883,JACKIE,Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
176444,m533,stepmom,L549567,u7883,JACKIE,Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
176445,m533,stepmom,L549566,u7879,BEN,That's Rache's song!
176446,m533,stepmom,L549565,u7883,JACKIE,In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
176447,m533,stepmom,L549535,u7883,JACKIE,I'm still sick but I'm better.
176448,m533,stepmom,L549534,u7879,BEN,So you're okay.
176449,m533,stepmom,L549529,u7879,BEN,Is your bad?
176450,m533,stepmom,L549528,u7883,JACKIE,Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
176451,m533,stepmom,L549526,u7883,JACKIE,I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?
176452,m533,stepmom,L549525,u7879,BEN,You have the WORST flu since...
176453,m533,stepmom,L549524,u7883,JACKIE,Mommy's sick guys.
176454,m533,stepmom,L549427,u7883,JACKIE,Pray.  We never find out.
176455,m533,stepmom,L549426,u7879,BEN,No.
176456,m533,stepmom,L549379,u7879,BEN,Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
176457,m533,stepmom,L549378,u7883,JACKIE,ARE YOU CRAZY YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
176458,m533,stepmom,L549372,u7883,JACKIE,Thursday's fine...
176459,m533,stepmom,L549371,u7879,BEN,Mommy if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben how come you don't call me son?
176460,m533,stepmom,L549368,u7879,BEN,Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
176461,m533,stepmom,L549367,u7883,JACKIE,I'm fine ba...
176462,m533,stepmom,L549366,u7879,BEN,Mom...?
176463,m533,stepmom,L549365,u7883,JACKIE,That I do.  Always will.
176464,m533,stepmom,L549362,u7883,JACKIE,Do me a favor?  Eat it and then give me a secret report okay?  Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.
176465,m533,stepmom,L549361,u7879,BEN,I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it she did.
176466,m533,stepmom,L549360,u7883,JACKIE,Of course you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
176467,m533,stepmom,L549359,u7879,BEN,Yes.
176468,m533,stepmom,L549358,u7883,JACKIE,I'm somewhere thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
176469,m533,stepmom,L549357,u7879,BEN,Where are you anyway?
176470,m533,stepmom,L549356,u7883,JACKIE,Not a lot sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
176471,m533,stepmom,L549355,u7879,BEN,Is that like Luigi's?
176472,m533,stepmom,L549354,u7883,JACKIE,You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs I'm flying them in from Sweden.
176473,m533,stepmom,L549353,u7879,BEN,And many meatballs.
176474,m533,stepmom,L549352,u7883,JACKIE,Honey this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
176475,m533,stepmom,L549351,u7879,BEN,Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
176476,m533,stepmom,L549139,u7879,BEN,If you want me to hate her I will.
176477,m533,stepmom,L549138,u7883,JACKIE,What honey?
176478,m533,stepmom,L549137,u7879,BEN,Mommy?
176479,m533,stepmom,L549136,u7883,JACKIE,Yes...if you like big hair...
176480,m533,stepmom,L549135,u7879,BEN,I think she's pretty Mommy.
176481,m533,stepmom,L549134,u7883,JACKIE,People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
176482,m533,stepmom,L549133,u7879,BEN,Does Rachel make a lot of money?
176483,m533,stepmom,L549132,u7883,JACKIE,Ben mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
176484,m533,stepmom,L549131,u7879,BEN,Rachel's job is she works.
176485,m533,stepmom,L549130,u7883,JACKIE,No that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son as if it were her priority.  Which means the most important job.
176486,m533,stepmom,L549129,u7879,BEN,Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
176487,m533,stepmom,L549093,u7879,BEN,I knew where I was all the time.
176488,m533,stepmom,L549092,u7883,JACKIE,Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
176489,m533,stepmom,L548941,u7883,JACKIE,Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
176490,m533,stepmom,L548940,u7879,BEN,Poof!  You're happy now.
176491,m533,stepmom,L548937,u7883,JACKIE,Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
176492,m533,stepmom,L548936,u7879,BEN,Queen of diamonds.
176493,m533,stepmom,L548863,u7883,JACKIE,Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that.
176494,m533,stepmom,L548862,u7879,BEN,I have lava.
176495,m533,stepmom,L548861,u7883,JACKIE,I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
176496,m533,stepmom,L548855,u7883,JACKIE,I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
176497,m533,stepmom,L548854,u7879,BEN,Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
176498,m533,stepmom,L549162,u7885,RACHEL,Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
176501,m533,stepmom,L548873,u7885,RACHEL,And when did that pass?
176503,m533,stepmom,L548871,u7885,RACHEL,You say that like I don't know that.
176505,m533,stepmom,L548869,u7885,RACHEL,Cooper back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
176507,m533,stepmom,L549242,u7883,JACKIE,Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
176509,m533,stepmom,L549240,u7883,JACKIE,I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why he was very mysteri...
176511,m533,stepmom,L549237,u7883,JACKIE,That's necessary huh?
176513,m533,stepmom,L549235,u7883,JACKIE,So we'll...radiate some more?
176515,m533,stepmom,L549233,u7883,JACKIE,People beat it don't they?  All the time.
176517,m533,stepmom,L549763,u7885,RACHEL,No no no this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u> <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u> can't be both.
176519,m533,stepmom,L549760,u7885,RACHEL,Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
176521,m533,stepmom,L549758,u7885,RACHEL,They're losing one mother.  They can't lose two.
176523,m533,stepmom,L549756,u7885,RACHEL,Which part of no don't you understand?
176525,m533,stepmom,L549754,u7885,RACHEL,I've got it.  It's in the can Cooper can wrap th...
176527,m533,stepmom,L549752,u7885,RACHEL,It's 1:45 I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
176528,m533,stepmom,L548876,u7885,RACHEL,Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
176530,m533,stepmom,L549533,u7884,LUKE,A lot smaller.
176531,m533,stepmom,L549532,u7883,JACKIE,I had a lot of treatments and they weren't any fun but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
176532,m533,stepmom,L549518,u7883,JACKIE,I live or I die.
176533,m533,stepmom,L549517,u7884,LUKE,What happens next?
176534,m533,stepmom,L549515,u7883,JACKIE,Walk in the park.  And thanks for the 'we'.
176535,m533,stepmom,L549514,u7884,LUKE,We're going to win this.
176536,m533,stepmom,L549513,u7883,JACKIE,I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
176537,m533,stepmom,L549423,u7883,JACKIE,Yeh better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous was it she made him?  Boy kids go wild for that.
176538,m533,stepmom,L549422,u7884,LUKE,Yet another spaghetti night.
176539,m533,stepmom,L549421,u7883,JACKIE,Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
176540,m533,stepmom,L549420,u7884,LUKE,You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
176541,m533,stepmom,L549418,u7884,LUKE,It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us are you?
176542,m533,stepmom,L549417,u7883,JACKIE,It's temporary.
176543,m533,stepmom,L549415,u7883,JACKIE,Stop.  You're making me insecure.
176544,m533,stepmom,L549414,u7884,LUKE,She's a charmer you'll see.  In fifty years the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
176545,m533,stepmom,L549279,u7883,JACKIE,And we all went through that together?
176546,m533,stepmom,L549278,u7884,LUKE,Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
176547,m533,stepmom,L549277,u7883,JACKIE,The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
176548,m533,stepmom,L549276,u7883,JACKIE,No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
176549,m533,stepmom,L549275,u7884,LUKE,You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
176550,m533,stepmom,L549274,u7884,LUKE,WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
176551,m533,stepmom,L549273,u7883,JACKIE,WE are over.
176552,m533,stepmom,L549272,u7884,LUKE,We...
176553,m533,stepmom,L549271,u7883,JACKIE,You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
176554,m533,stepmom,L549270,u7884,LUKE,It's a huge moment in their life --
176555,m533,stepmom,L549269,u7883,JACKIE,To make it easier for them or you?
176556,m533,stepmom,L549268,u7884,LUKE,It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
176557,m533,stepmom,L549264,u7883,JACKIE,Just not to me.
176558,m533,stepmom,L549263,u7884,LUKE,I grew up a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
176559,m533,stepmom,L549262,u7883,JACKIE,Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
176560,m533,stepmom,L549261,u7884,LUKE,I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
176561,m533,stepmom,L549259,u7884,LUKE,Getting so beautiful...she looks more like you every day.  Jackie...I've really given this a lot of thought.  A great deal of thought...
176562,m533,stepmom,L549258,u7883,JACKIE,Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
176563,m533,stepmom,L549257,u7884,LUKE,Still please.
176564,m533,stepmom,L549149,u7883,JACKIE,And I'm supposed to care.
176565,m533,stepmom,L549148,u7884,LUKE,I'm afraid she's going to walk.
176566,m533,stepmom,L549147,u7883,JACKIE,<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u> even.
176567,m533,stepmom,L549146,u7884,LUKE,You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel and you're right I'm disappointed in her learning curve and...
176568,m533,stepmom,L549145,u7884,LUKE,Partly.  But partly you're mad.
176569,m533,stepmom,L549144,u7883,JACKIE,You're saying don't make the kids a football don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
176570,m533,stepmom,L549143,u7884,LUKE,Don't do this.
176571,m533,stepmom,L549142,u7883,JACKIE,Called him.  We set an ap...
176572,m533,stepmom,L549118,u7883,JACKIE,We've broken a lot of promises haven't we Luke?
176573,m533,stepmom,L549117,u7884,LUKE,Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
176574,m533,stepmom,L549116,u7883,JACKIE,I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
176575,m533,stepmom,L549115,u7884,LUKE,Jackie you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
176576,m533,stepmom,L549114,u7883,JACKIE,Not to me.
176577,m533,stepmom,L549113,u7884,LUKE,But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
176578,m533,stepmom,L549112,u7883,JACKIE,Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
176579,m533,stepmom,L549111,u7884,LUKE,Our children.
176580,m533,stepmom,L549076,u7883,JACKIE,...until the plan changed when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
176581,m533,stepmom,L549075,u7884,LUKE,Jackie <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
176582,m533,stepmom,L549074,u7883,JACKIE,At the Big Apple Circus it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
176583,m533,stepmom,L549073,u7884,LUKE,You're WHERE?
176584,m533,stepmom,L549072,u7883,JACKIE,Just outside the big top we're almo...
176585,m533,stepmom,L548919,u7884,LUKE,Good...Well...Take care.
176586,m533,stepmom,L548918,u7883,JACKIE,Easy enough.
176587,m533,stepmom,L548917,u7884,LUKE,Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday and you can pick up that Thursday Friday after soccer and Saturday before riding.
176588,m533,stepmom,L548916,u7883,JACKIE,Luke I need to switch next Friday for Thursday so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there and I'll pick up Monday Tuesday and Wednesday.
176589,m533,stepmom,L548915,u7884,LUKE,Me too.
176590,m533,stepmom,L548914,u7883,JACKIE,I'm worried.
176591,m533,stepmom,L548913,u7884,LUKE,You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
176592,m533,stepmom,L548912,u7883,JACKIE,You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
176593,m533,stepmom,L548911,u7884,LUKE,I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
176594,m533,stepmom,L548910,u7883,JACKIE,It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
176595,m533,stepmom,L548909,u7884,LUKE,Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
176596,m533,stepmom,L548905,u7884,LUKE,Jackie she was five minutes late --
176597,m533,stepmom,L548904,u7883,JACKIE,Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
176598,m533,stepmom,L548903,u7884,LUKE,Napalm.
176599,m533,stepmom,L548900,u7884,LUKE,Jackie they come to be part of my life.  Rachel <u>is</u> part of that life.
176600,m533,stepmom,L548899,u7883,JACKIE,They want to be with you Luke they go to your house to be with their father.
176601,m533,stepmom,L548898,u7884,LUKE,Well we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
176602,m533,stepmom,L548897,u7883,JACKIE,We're not discussing your age.
176603,m533,stepmom,L548896,u7884,LUKE,Rachel's not half my age.
176604,m533,stepmom,L548895,u7883,JACKIE,Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids he's now living with a woman half his age --
176605,m533,stepmom,L548894,u7884,LUKE,I've been with someone for quite some time and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
176606,m533,stepmom,L548891,u7884,LUKE,You think I didn't get that?
176607,m533,stepmom,L548890,u7883,JACKIE,Something's up wi...
176608,m533,stepmom,L548889,u7884,LUKE,I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
176609,m533,stepmom,L548888,u7883,JACKIE,Because you don't really seem here.
176610,m533,stepmom,L548887,u7884,LUKE,I'm here.
176611,m533,stepmom,L548886,u7883,JACKIE,Are you here?
176612,m533,stepmom,L548884,u7883,JACKIE,Remarried.  There is no move.
176613,m533,stepmom,L548883,u7884,LUKE,Planning on getting --
176614,m533,stepmom,L550026,u7883,JACKIE,Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
176615,m533,stepmom,L550025,u7885,RACHEL,You know there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
176616,m533,stepmom,L550022,u7883,JACKIE,Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
176617,m533,stepmom,L550021,u7885,RACHEL,Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time y'know.
176618,m533,stepmom,L550010,u7883,JACKIE,I have their past.
176619,m533,stepmom,L550009,u7885,RACHEL,You know every story every wound every memory their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u> every moment...
176620,m533,stepmom,L550008,u7883,JACKIE,You'll learn.
176621,m533,stepmom,L550007,u7885,RACHEL,You ride with Annabelle...
176622,m533,stepmom,L550006,u7883,JACKIE,You're the hip and fresh.
176623,m533,stepmom,L550005,u7885,RACHEL,Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
176624,m533,stepmom,L550004,u7883,JACKIE,What do I have that you don't?
176625,m533,stepmom,L550003,u7885,RACHEL,With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
176626,m533,stepmom,L549999,u7885,RACHEL,Uh.  You hate my guts?
176627,m533,stepmom,L549998,u7883,JACKIE,Why didn't I?
176628,m533,stepmom,L549997,u7883,JACKIE,He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is telling you this story would have been the kindest most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
176629,m533,stepmom,L549996,u7885,RACHEL,Ben never mentioned it.
176630,m533,stepmom,L549995,u7883,JACKIE,I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
176631,m533,stepmom,L549994,u7885,RACHEL,You are lying you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u> you could find him from a <u>coma</u> there is no WAY!
176632,m533,stepmom,L549993,u7883,JACKIE,I lost him.  I was panicked.
176633,m533,stepmom,L549992,u7885,RACHEL,You're lying.
176634,m533,stepmom,L549986,u7885,RACHEL,Maybe I was wrong on that one.
176635,m533,stepmom,L549985,u7883,JACKIE,Come on a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
176636,m533,stepmom,L549984,u7885,RACHEL,Well it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome huh?  You die young you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image and...
176637,m533,stepmom,L549983,u7883,JACKIE,Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
176638,m533,stepmom,L549982,u7885,RACHEL,I never wanted to be a mom.  Then sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone the rest of my life...
176639,m533,stepmom,L549980,u7885,RACHEL,And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be.  And I can't handle it.
176640,m533,stepmom,L549979,u7883,JACKIE,No there isn't.
176641,m533,stepmom,L549978,u7885,RACHEL,I love Luke I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
176642,m533,stepmom,L549977,u7885,RACHEL,Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
176643,m533,stepmom,L549976,u7883,JACKIE,What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
176644,m533,stepmom,L549975,u7885,RACHEL,Double.
176645,m533,stepmom,L549974,u7883,JACKIE,She likes a Stolie no ice.
176646,m533,stepmom,L549972,u7885,RACHEL,Neutral ground.  What's up?
176647,m533,stepmom,L549971,u7883,JACKIE,Thanks for coming out.
176648,m533,stepmom,L549928,u7885,RACHEL,<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
176649,m533,stepmom,L549927,u7883,JACKIE,You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
176650,m533,stepmom,L549926,u7885,RACHEL,And she'll fight back again.  God help me what have I done.
176651,m533,stepmom,L549925,u7883,JACKIE,And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
176652,m533,stepmom,L549924,u7883,JACKIE,Well that's what parenting is <u>about</u> little girl.  They are <u>pleading</u> to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell <u>showed</u> her.
176653,m533,stepmom,L549923,u7885,RACHEL,She wasn't steering her own course she was steering <u>yours</u>.
176654,m533,stepmom,L549922,u7883,JACKIE,Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u> inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
176655,m533,stepmom,L549921,u7883,JACKIE,Shut the fuck up.  <u>I</u> didn't go behind <u>your</u> back.
176656,m533,stepmom,L549920,u7885,RACHEL,Oh please.
176657,m533,stepmom,L549919,u7883,JACKIE,See in that crisis I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
176658,m533,stepmom,L549917,u7883,JACKIE,Well maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win baby'.
176659,m533,stepmom,L549916,u7885,RACHEL,You weren't passing 'em out.
176660,m533,stepmom,L549915,u7883,JACKIE,You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
176661,m533,stepmom,L549914,u7885,RACHEL,That's not wh...
176662,m533,stepmom,L549913,u7883,JACKIE,You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
176663,m533,stepmom,L549912,u7883,JACKIE,So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
176664,m533,stepmom,L549911,u7885,RACHEL,She was beaten and bloodied and it was going to go on uni...
176665,m533,stepmom,L549910,u7885,RACHEL,Worked.  Like a charm.
176666,m533,stepmom,L549909,u7883,JACKIE,You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
176667,m533,stepmom,L549908,u7885,RACHEL,Aw.
176668,m533,stepmom,L549907,u7883,JACKIE,You put filth in my child's mouth.
176669,m533,stepmom,L549906,u7885,RACHEL,Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
176670,m533,stepmom,L549905,u7883,JACKIE,You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
176671,m533,stepmom,L549904,u7885,RACHEL,Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
176672,m533,stepmom,L549903,u7883,JACKIE,Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
176673,m533,stepmom,L549902,u7885,RACHEL,Give 'em my number.
176674,m533,stepmom,L549901,u7883,JACKIE,Because there'll be oh 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
176675,m533,stepmom,L549900,u7885,RACHEL,It doesn't matter I didn't tell h...
176676,m533,stepmom,L549899,u7883,JACKIE,Now 'limp dick' I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
176677,m533,stepmom,L549898,u7885,RACHEL,Don't be too sure.
176678,m533,stepmom,L549897,u7883,JACKIE,And I'm going to win.
176679,m533,stepmom,L549896,u7885,RACHEL,Are we.
176680,m533,stepmom,L549895,u7883,JACKIE,Now we're going to have a fight you and I.
176681,m533,stepmom,L549893,u7883,JACKIE,He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
176682,m533,stepmom,L549892,u7885,RACHEL,Looks nice enough to m...
176683,m533,stepmom,L549891,u7883,JACKIE,Who in the world <u>is</u> he?
176684,m533,stepmom,L549890,u7885,RACHEL,You really didn't have to come you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...
176685,m533,stepmom,L549846,u7885,RACHEL,He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.
176686,m533,stepmom,L549845,u7883,JACKIE,Is that what he told you?
176687,m533,stepmom,L549844,u7885,RACHEL,That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
176688,m533,stepmom,L549838,u7883,JACKIE,Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
176689,m533,stepmom,L549837,u7885,RACHEL,And her...?
176690,m533,stepmom,L549836,u7883,JACKIE,Somehow his blanket always looked like a cape even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story over and over.  How he was born a magician.
176691,m533,stepmom,L549832,u7883,JACKIE,Feeling the pressure?
176692,m533,stepmom,L549831,u7885,RACHEL,My advice to you?  Don't die.
176693,m533,stepmom,L549828,u7883,JACKIE,That's motherhood.  That's the job with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy.
176694,m533,stepmom,L549827,u7885,RACHEL,I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
176695,m533,stepmom,L549826,u7883,JACKIE,I know you huh?  The car pools he measles the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
176696,m533,stepmom,L549825,u7883,JACKIE,Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me there were days when I felt so lost so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
176697,m533,stepmom,L549824,u7885,RACHEL,It's the same choice you made.
176698,m533,stepmom,L549823,u7883,JACKIE,Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
176699,m533,stepmom,L549822,u7885,RACHEL,Hey you haven't quit on you I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean I'm juggling a lot right n...
176700,m533,stepmom,L549821,u7883,JACKIE,You mean after I'm dead?
176701,m533,stepmom,L549820,u7885,RACHEL,It was just a job there'll be plenty of others.
176702,m533,stepmom,L549819,u7883,JACKIE,Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
176703,m533,stepmom,L549818,u7885,RACHEL,It's just not the right time t...
176704,m533,stepmom,L549816,u7885,RACHEL,No.
176705,m533,stepmom,L549815,u7883,JACKIE,I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
176706,m533,stepmom,L549810,u7883,JACKIE,...go to the park.  In the worst way.
176707,m533,stepmom,L549809,u7885,RACHEL,Hon maybe your mom would like t...
176708,m533,stepmom,L549727,u7883,JACKIE,It's <u>covered</u> okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
176709,m533,stepmom,L549726,u7885,RACHEL,Yah?  Well even the best mom in the world the smartest the wisest whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
176710,m533,stepmom,L549725,u7883,JACKIE,Thanks but it's under control.
176711,m533,stepmom,L549724,u7885,RACHEL,Can I say one thing?  I mean the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing b...
176712,m533,stepmom,L549723,u7883,JACKIE,How's she doing with Brad?
176713,m533,stepmom,L549722,u7885,RACHEL,Yeh she's...I'll get you Ben first it's past his bedti...
176714,m533,stepmom,L549721,u7883,JACKIE,Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
176715,m533,stepmom,L549701,u7883,JACKIE,What else?  Keep on keepin' on.
176716,m533,stepmom,L549700,u7885,RACHEL,And you said...
176717,m533,stepmom,L549699,u7883,JACKIE,He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
176718,m533,stepmom,L549697,u7885,RACHEL,I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
176719,m533,stepmom,L549696,u7883,JACKIE,The primo stuff is great for pain.
176720,m533,stepmom,L549694,u7885,RACHEL,Brad Kovitsky.
176721,m533,stepmom,L549693,u7883,JACKIE,You try to center on the big issues y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
176722,m533,stepmom,L549691,u7883,JACKIE,Yeh that's bull.  I'm going for serene they say some actually get there.
176723,m533,stepmom,L549690,u7885,RACHEL,You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
176724,m533,stepmom,L549689,u7883,JACKIE,I really look like shit.
176725,m533,stepmom,L549688,u7883,JACKIE,It's promising this one.  We're upbeat.
176726,m533,stepmom,L549687,u7885,RACHEL,So.  Hopeful.
176727,m533,stepmom,L549683,u7883,JACKIE,It's a mess right now.  That's my project when I get back.
176728,m533,stepmom,L549682,u7885,RACHEL,Can I look at the pictures?
176729,m533,stepmom,L549598,u7885,RACHEL,Beats me.  Ask your mom.
176730,m533,stepmom,L549597,u7883,JACKIE,And you said...?
176731,m533,stepmom,L549594,u7885,RACHEL,Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean you've got cancer <u>this</u> is serious.
176732,m533,stepmom,L549593,u7883,JACKIE,She's devastated.
176733,m533,stepmom,L549592,u7885,RACHEL,Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing so one of them can dump the other one and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy without ever having to actually date.
176734,m533,stepmom,L549591,u7883,JACKIE,Oh my God.
176735,m533,stepmom,L549590,u7885,RACHEL,Anyway.  He walks up to her on lunch yard today.  And tells her... publicly...that they're 'breaking up.'
176736,m533,stepmom,L549589,u7883,JACKIE,...going out yeh.  I had kids of my own once.
176737,m533,stepmom,L549588,u7885,RACHEL,As you may know 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere they don't even eat lunch together it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
176738,m533,stepmom,L549587,u7885,RACHEL,Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
176739,m533,stepmom,L549586,u7883,JACKIE,Moi?
176740,m533,stepmom,L549585,u7885,RACHEL,She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
176741,m533,stepmom,L549584,u7883,JACKIE,She hasn't mentioned this.
176742,m533,stepmom,L549583,u7885,RACHEL,That.  And.  Annabelle is over her head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
176743,m533,stepmom,L549582,u7883,JACKIE,You're a cross-dresser.
176744,m533,stepmom,L549581,u7885,RACHEL,So I have to tell you something in confidence...
176745,m533,stepmom,L549580,u7885,RACHEL,Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
176746,m533,stepmom,L549579,u7883,JACKIE,Small world.
176747,m533,stepmom,L549505,u7883,JACKIE,Ironic huh?
176748,m533,stepmom,L549504,u7885,RACHEL,Okay I'm undeserving.
176749,m533,stepmom,L549503,u7883,JACKIE,I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>!
176750,m533,stepmom,L549502,u7885,RACHEL,See I know that.
176751,m533,stepmom,L549501,u7883,JACKIE,They came out of my <u>body</u>!
176752,m533,stepmom,L549498,u7883,JACKIE,You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
176753,m533,stepmom,L549497,u7885,RACHEL,And cigarettes.  I smoke too.
176754,m533,stepmom,L549495,u7883,JACKIE,How would you know <u>anything</u>?
176755,m533,stepmom,L549494,u7885,RACHEL,I don't but...
176756,m533,stepmom,L549493,u7883,JACKIE,How the hell would you know?
176757,m533,stepmom,L549492,u7885,RACHEL,You bet you are.
176758,m533,stepmom,L549490,u7885,RACHEL,You're not dying.
176759,m533,stepmom,L549489,u7883,JACKIE,Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer your hair falls out but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
176760,m533,stepmom,L549483,u7883,JACKIE,Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
176761,m533,stepmom,L549482,u7885,RACHEL,I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
176762,m533,stepmom,L549481,u7885,RACHEL,...it's my problem too.
176763,m533,stepmom,L549480,u7883,JACKIE,Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
176764,m533,stepmom,L549479,u7885,RACHEL,Luke.  Can't live like that.
176765,m533,stepmom,L549478,u7883,JACKIE,Did I hear the word...
176766,m533,stepmom,L549477,u7885,RACHEL,We can't live like that.
176767,m533,stepmom,L549476,u7883,JACKIE,Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer every other holiday it's not ideal but people make it work and...
176768,m533,stepmom,L549472,u7885,RACHEL,But I came here to...
176769,m533,stepmom,L549471,u7883,JACKIE,Nobody likes a snoop.
176770,m533,stepmom,L549470,u7885,RACHEL,And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
176771,m533,stepmom,L549469,u7883,JACKIE,Don't flatter yourself.
176772,m533,stepmom,L549468,u7885,RACHEL,Look you've never liked me...
176773,m533,stepmom,L549467,u7885,RACHEL,You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.
176774,m533,stepmom,L549466,u7883,JACKIE,You WHAT?
176775,m533,stepmom,L549465,u7885,RACHEL,You're not working at Random House I talked to them.
176776,m533,stepmom,L549464,u7883,JACKIE,My boss.
176777,m533,stepmom,L549463,u7885,RACHEL,I was looking for Annabelle's book and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
176778,m533,stepmom,L549462,u7883,JACKIE,I don't know wh...
176779,m533,stepmom,L549404,u7883,JACKIE,Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret okay?
176780,m533,stepmom,L549403,u7885,RACHEL,Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
176781,m533,stepmom,L549402,u7885,RACHEL,Hey any help you need we'll cover.

176783,m533,stepmom,L549399,u7885,RACHEL,Wowie.  How wonderful!
176784,m533,stepmom,L549398,u7883,JACKIE,...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
176785,m533,stepmom,L549395,u7883,JACKIE,Not great.  Plus I've got things on my mind.  You know.
176786,m533,stepmom,L549394,u7885,RACHEL,You feeling all right?
176787,m533,stepmom,L549392,u7885,RACHEL,When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
176788,m533,stepmom,L549391,u7883,JACKIE,Yes?
176789,m533,stepmom,L549390,u7885,RACHEL,Jackie?
176790,m533,stepmom,L549389,u7883,JACKIE,She was angry at herself.
176791,m533,stepmom,L549388,u7885,RACHEL,Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
176792,m533,stepmom,L549387,u7883,JACKIE,Anxiety.
176793,m533,stepmom,L549386,u7885,RACHEL,What about obsessively picking her split ends?
176794,m533,stepmom,L549334,u7885,RACHEL,No way.  I told her two three years maybe for such an expens...
176795,m533,stepmom,L549333,u7883,JACKIE,Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
176796,m533,stepmom,L549332,u7885,RACHEL,I'm sorry I just...
176797,m533,stepmom,L549324,u7883,JACKIE,It's okay it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
176798,m533,stepmom,L549323,u7885,RACHEL,Sorry I'm late I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
176799,m533,stepmom,L549213,u7883,JACKIE,Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
176800,m533,stepmom,L549212,u7885,RACHEL,Not personally.
176801,m533,stepmom,L549211,u7883,JACKIE,Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
176802,m533,stepmom,L549210,u7885,RACHEL,Why not just bring the whole toilet?
176803,m533,stepmom,L549209,u7883,JACKIE,Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops potty seat covers for public restrooms...
176804,m533,stepmom,L549208,u7883,JACKIE,Fine forget it.
176805,m533,stepmom,L549207,u7885,RACHEL,I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
176806,m533,stepmom,L549206,u7883,JACKIE,However many.  It's not enough.
176807,m533,stepmom,L549205,u7885,RACHEL,What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
176808,m533,stepmom,L549204,u7883,JACKIE,I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
176809,m533,stepmom,L549202,u7885,RACHEL,I did it for her.
176810,m533,stepmom,L549201,u7883,JACKIE,So why did y...
176811,m533,stepmom,L549200,u7883,JACKIE,Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
176812,m533,stepmom,L549199,u7885,RACHEL,I need practice.
176813,m533,stepmom,L549198,u7883,JACKIE,You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
176814,m533,stepmom,L549197,u7885,RACHEL,She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
176815,m533,stepmom,L549196,u7885,RACHEL,I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.
176816,m533,stepmom,L549195,u7883,JACKIE,I didn't need you to take the blame for me I'm quite...
176817,m533,stepmom,L549194,u7885,RACHEL,I have a snoop.
176818,m533,stepmom,L549192,u7885,RACHEL,I don't recall inviting you.
176819,m533,stepmom,L549191,u7883,JACKIE,I'm sorry.  Look I'm not real comfortable being here but...
176820,m533,stepmom,L549190,u7885,RACHEL,...in.
176821,m533,stepmom,L549124,u7883,JACKIE,A court <u>order</u> is gonna say that <u>woman</u> is <u>never</u> <u>alone</u> with my children!  Ever <u>again</u>!  Do you HEAR that?
176822,m533,stepmom,L549123,u7885,RACHEL,Well maybe they would if they thought it was okay with y...
176823,m533,stepmom,L549122,u7883,JACKIE,I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
176824,m533,stepmom,L549110,u7883,JACKIE,You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
176825,m533,stepmom,L549109,u7885,RACHEL,Jackie if I thought for one moment...
176826,m533,stepmom,L549105,u7885,RACHEL,I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
176827,m533,stepmom,L549104,u7883,JACKIE,Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
176828,m533,stepmom,L549079,u7883,JACKIE,Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
176829,m533,stepmom,L549078,u7885,RACHEL,Yeh?
176830,m533,stepmom,L549068,u7883,JACKIE,Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses.  To break a child's heart.
176831,m533,stepmom,L549067,u7885,RACHEL,Look I...
176832,m533,stepmom,L549066,u7883,JACKIE,Machines do not EAT message.
176833,m533,stepmom,L549034,u7883,JACKIE,You got to hell!
176834,m533,stepmom,L549033,u7885,RACHEL,But it's not on the schedule!
176835,m533,stepmom,L549032,u7883,JACKIE,Get out!
176836,m533,stepmom,L549031,u7885,RACHEL,Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled coddled <u>brats</u>!
176837,m533,stepmom,L549030,u7883,JACKIE,Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
176838,m533,stepmom,L549029,u7885,RACHEL,You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
176839,m533,stepmom,L549028,u7883,JACKIE,You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
176840,m533,stepmom,L549027,u7885,RACHEL,No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
176841,m533,stepmom,L549026,u7883,JACKIE,Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
176842,m533,stepmom,L549025,u7885,RACHEL,I was in there in him.
176843,m533,stepmom,L549024,u7883,JACKIE,I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
176844,m533,stepmom,L549023,u7885,RACHEL,Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
176845,m533,stepmom,L549021,u7885,RACHEL,<u>Forgiveness?</u>  For <u>what</u> exactly?
176846,m533,stepmom,L549020,u7883,JACKIE,...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness with...
176847,m533,stepmom,L549019,u7885,RACHEL,She's been talking about this little editing machine it's only...
176848,m533,stepmom,L549017,u7885,RACHEL,Nothing.  Look I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
176849,m533,stepmom,L549016,u7883,JACKIE,What did you do?
176850,m533,stepmom,L549015,u7885,RACHEL,Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
176851,m533,stepmom,L549014,u7883,JACKIE,What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
176852,m533,stepmom,L549013,u7883,JACKIE,Annabelle how's your video rep...
176853,m533,stepmom,L549012,u7885,RACHEL,What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
176854,m533,stepmom,L549011,u7883,JACKIE,We don't have any coffee.
176855,m533,stepmom,L549010,u7885,RACHEL,Can I please have a cup of coffee?
176856,m533,stepmom,L549009,u7883,JACKIE,Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
176857,m533,stepmom,L549008,u7885,RACHEL,This is Friday her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
176858,m533,stepmom,L549007,u7883,JACKIE,How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
176859,m533,stepmom,L549888,u7885,RACHEL,I'm gonna get me a drink.
176860,m533,stepmom,L549887,u7884,LUKE,Where you goin'?
176861,m533,stepmom,L549883,u7885,RACHEL,How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off just that easily?
176862,m533,stepmom,L549882,u7884,LUKE,We make our lives one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
176863,m533,stepmom,L549880,u7885,RACHEL,Because you've changed so much.
176864,m533,stepmom,L549879,u7884,LUKE,That's not us.
176865,m533,stepmom,L549878,u7885,RACHEL,'But keep dancing and if you're lucky I might just never leave who knows?'
176866,m533,stepmom,L549877,u7885,RACHEL,No here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u> babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
176867,m533,stepmom,L549876,u7884,LUKE,That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
176868,m533,stepmom,L549872,u7885,RACHEL,No she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
176869,m533,stepmom,L549871,u7884,LUKE,'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
176870,m533,stepmom,L549870,u7885,RACHEL,Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable too safe too predict- able.  It's a partnership it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out every day for the rest of my life...'
176871,m533,stepmom,L549869,u7884,LUKE,Restless.
176872,m533,stepmom,L549868,u7885,RACHEL,By way of saying you were unhappy.
176873,m533,stepmom,L549867,u7884,LUKE,I told her I loved her.
176874,m533,stepmom,L549866,u7885,RACHEL,Let me put it this way.  Hell no.
176875,m533,stepmom,L549865,u7884,LUKE,Can we go sit somewhere?
176876,m533,stepmom,L549864,u7885,RACHEL,What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
176877,m533,stepmom,L549863,u7884,LUKE,She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
176878,m533,stepmom,L549862,u7884,LUKE,'...the kids have camp.  Their friends are here.  Over there I'll just be shopping in a language I don't even know.  My life and the kids' lives aren't here to service your mid-life crisis.'  Did it go like that?
176879,m533,stepmom,L549861,u7885,RACHEL,...while she watched the kids.  Then you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
176880,m533,stepmom,L549860,u7884,LUKE,I needed some time away.
176881,m533,stepmom,L549859,u7885,RACHEL,You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much you took another.
176882,m533,stepmom,L549858,u7884,LUKE,Why in the world would she t...
176883,m533,stepmom,L549857,u7885,RACHEL,Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?
176884,m533,stepmom,L549856,u7884,LUKE,Well they will be.
176885,m533,stepmom,L549855,u7885,RACHEL,Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
176886,m533,stepmom,L549851,u7885,RACHEL,Hold your applause.  We're not having fun here.
176887,m533,stepmom,L549850,u7884,LUKE,What a great surpri...
176888,m533,stepmom,L549709,u7884,LUKE,I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
176889,m533,stepmom,L549708,u7885,RACHEL,No problem.
176890,m533,stepmom,L549559,u7885,RACHEL,I know that.
176891,m533,stepmom,L549558,u7884,LUKE,She's not gonna die.
176892,m533,stepmom,L549557,u7885,RACHEL,Great wallow in guilt you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
176893,m533,stepmom,L549556,u7884,LUKE,They're my kids.
176894,m533,stepmom,L549554,u7885,RACHEL,Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
176895,m533,stepmom,L549553,u7884,LUKE,It's Anna Sui you should be doing it.
176896,m533,stepmom,L549552,u7885,RACHEL,It's just an assignment.
176897,m533,stepmom,L549551,u7885,RACHEL,It's no biggie.

176900,m533,stepmom,L549311,u7884,LUKE,Rache it may take time.
176901,m533,stepmom,L549310,u7885,RACHEL,Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
176902,m533,stepmom,L549308,u7884,LUKE,Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
176903,m533,stepmom,L549307,u7885,RACHEL,Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
176904,m533,stepmom,L549306,u7884,LUKE,It's forever you know.

176917,m533,stepmom,L549050,u7884,LUKE,Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
176918,m533,stepmom,L548975,u7885,RACHEL,You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long!  Jesus what did you see in her?  I don't get it -- I just don't get it.
176919,m533,stepmom,L548974,u7884,LUKE,No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
176920,m533,stepmom,L548973,u7885,RACHEL,Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
176921,m533,stepmom,L548972,u7884,LUKE,It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
176922,m533,stepmom,L548971,u7885,RACHEL,Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
176923,m533,stepmom,L548970,u7884,LUKE,Nobody's telling them to hate you --
176924,m533,stepmom,L548969,u7885,RACHEL,And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
176925,m533,stepmom,L548968,u7884,LUKE,They don't hate you --
176926,m533,stepmom,L548967,u7885,RACHEL,Look.  I know they hate me.

176957,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552926,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Oh yes that's right.
176960,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552917,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Goodbye Mister Ambassador.
176962,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552692,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Don't you realize that despite your incredible distrust and suspicion that in fact you place a far greater trust in us than inspection would require?  You trust us not to cause a war accidentally - and of course we are obliged to place the same trust in you.
176964,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552690,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Surely you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
176966,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552688,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,That's nonsense and you know it!
176968,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552686,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
176969,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552685,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,How dare you talk to me in this manner?
176971,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552683,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Damn you de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
176973,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552681,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Yes?
176974,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552598,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
176976,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552596,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
176979,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552592,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Mister Ambassador what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
176981,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552584,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Where is this...thing?
176984,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552545,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,I'll hold this if you don't mind.  You can have it back when you leave.
176986,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552543,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,What's the meaning of this?
176987,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552536,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Did you get that Kulnick?
176989,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552534,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,At his office in the Capitol.
176991,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552530,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Yes of course.
176993,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552528,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Don't be ridiculous.
176995,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552526,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Now Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
176997,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552517,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Moffo!
176999,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552515,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Certainly - how about some breakfast?

177023,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552625,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Who the hell do you think you are sir???
177024,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552623,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R or T...R...T...
177025,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552621,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E or P...E...O or E...O...P... let's see there would be six possible combinations.
177026,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552619,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
177027,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552617,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
177028,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552662,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Colonel remember a reprimand from the President can be pretty serious to a career officer...Just a second operator I know I have it somewhere.
177030,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552660,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second operator...  Colonel shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
177031,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552653,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Well I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
177033,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552651,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,He wanted to talk to General Ripper didn't he?
177035,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552649,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
177037,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552647,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Okay Colonel.  But look there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
177039,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552645,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Look Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
177040,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552644,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Now look I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
177041,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552643,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Sure...sure Colonel.  Now look I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
177043,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552641,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Look Colonel.  You keep me covered but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
177045,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552639,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Didn't they tell you?
177047,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552637,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Look General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
177049,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552635,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Colonel don't you know what's going on?
177051,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552633,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Look Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
177053,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552631,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Look I didn't shoot him!
177055,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552629,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,What?
177057,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552627,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Well you can't do that because he's dead.
177079,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552928,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
177080,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552228,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Buck when I told you to give them right up to the top you said we couldn't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he's a psycho.
177081,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552226,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
177082,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552224,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,You aren't sure!
177083,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552222,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
177084,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552220,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,General Schmuck?
177085,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552218,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,What kind of trouble?
177087,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552677,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,I want him upped to Brigadier General and recomended for the D.S.C.
177089,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552274,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
177091,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552272,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,You see you knew the answer all the time General.
177093,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552270,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Under the circumstances General what would you think they should do?
177095,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552268,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,That's a very wise deduction General.
177097,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552266,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
177099,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552264,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Yes?
177102,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552124,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Yes sir.
177104,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552122,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Thank you sir.
177106,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552120,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,No sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention sir.
177108,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552118,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,General Ripper if I shut down the communi- cations center there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone for that matter.
177110,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552116,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,No sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.

177114,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552112,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,No sir.
177116,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552110,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,To you sir.  But how do I know?
177118,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552108,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Yes sir.  I just thought of something sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
177120,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552106,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,I understand sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
177122,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552104,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,You're right sir.
177124,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552102,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,That's right sir.
177126,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552098,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Yes sir.
177128,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552096,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
177130,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552094,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,A shooting war!
177132,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552092,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Yes sir.  What's up General Ripper?
177134,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552090,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Condition Red!
177136,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552088,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Yes sir.
177138,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552086,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,No sir.
177140,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552084,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,I don't know sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
177142,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552082,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Certainly General.  Why do you ask sir?
177144,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552080,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Yes sir.
177146,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552078,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Combat Operations Center Major Mandrake speaking.
177147,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552569,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Major I happen to believe in a life after this one so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
177148,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552568,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,General now that you've done that I beg you to recall the Wing.
177149,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552566,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Peace on earth.
177150,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552565,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,To peace on earth Major.
177151,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552563,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Yes sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting sir?
177152,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552562,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Major those are my boys out there dying.
177153,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552398,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Major I hate to say this but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated and you don't even know it.
177154,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552397,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Look sir.  I'm no expert on the subject but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like say both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are and if they cheat or even hold back information we'd pull right out.
177155,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552396,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Do you think they would cheat?
177156,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552395,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,No sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
177157,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552394,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Do you think we'd cheat?
177158,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552393,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,General what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing is good enough for me.
177159,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552392,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,And you'd like to see that?
177160,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552391,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,If they gave us what we think we need yes I guess we would.
177161,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552390,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want we'd agree wouldn't we?
177162,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552389,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,But General we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact a a lot of people say we never will.
177163,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552388,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
177164,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552387,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Don't you think he knows something about this General Ripper?
177165,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552386,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Don't be offended Major.  Our President holds the same views.
177166,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552385,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Well I'm not sir.  Honestly sir.
177167,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552384,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Major you're talking like one of them!
177168,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552383,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Gee sir that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
177169,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552382,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,No Major I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
177170,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552381,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Well for the same reasons we do sir. Don't you see?
177171,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552380,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,I still ask why do they want disarmament?
177172,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552379,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Well sir I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
177173,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552378,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Go on Major.  You fascinate me.
177174,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552377,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,That's right sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
177175,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552375,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,I was just going to say as long as the weapons exist sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
177176,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552374,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Go on Major.
177177,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552373,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Well sir like I said for the same reasons we do.  I mean all the experts say the most likely way for War to start nowadays is by an accident or a mistake or by some mentally unbalanced person -- 
177178,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552372,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And if that's the case I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
177179,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552371,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Right.
177180,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552370,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
177181,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552369,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,I don't know sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more for anybody.
177182,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552368,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country Major.
177183,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552367,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Yes sir.  But so do we.
177184,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552366,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,You're very naive Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
177185,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552365,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
177186,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552364,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Not yet Major.  Not yet.
177187,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552363,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Well I know they've been going on for years and they haven't gotten any place.
177188,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552362,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Where?  Everywhere Major.  Everywhere.
177189,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552361,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Where sir?
177190,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552360,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Major Mandrake I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely do you?
177191,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552359,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,But if you just let things alone we wouldn't lose anyone.
177192,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552358,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people tops.
177193,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552357,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,But even then we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort or they'd miss their targets or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
177194,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552356,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,I know so Major.  I know so.  And add to that the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
177195,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552355,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,I guess so.
177196,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552354,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy wouldn't they?
177197,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552353,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
177198,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552352,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,You're being dense Major.  I certainly don't
177199,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552351,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people sir?
177200,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552350,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,That's close enough Major.
177201,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552349,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Well I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
177202,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552348,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,If we haven't taken any further action they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
177203,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552347,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,But when they do sir won't they hit back with everything they've got?
177204,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552346,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,You see Major at this very moment while we sit and chat a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
177205,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552345,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,I'm trying to sir.
177206,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552344,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,When he said it fifty years ago he might have been right.  But today war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me Major?
177207,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552343,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,I see.
177208,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552342,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
177209,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552341,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,I don't think so sir.
177210,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552340,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
177211,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552339,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,No sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
177212,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552338,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,I've given it alot of thought Major.  Don't think I haven't.
177213,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552337,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Well General -- I was wondering why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
177214,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552336,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Ask away Major.
177215,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552335,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,General Ripper can I ask another question?
177216,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552334,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,To peace on earth.
177217,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552333,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,What shall we drink to sir?
177218,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552332,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Perfect.  Thank you Major.  And now let's drink a toast.
177219,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552331,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,That about right?
177220,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552330,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Just a squirt.
177221,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552329,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,How much soda sir.
177222,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552328,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,You're damned right they are.
177223,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552327,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,I suppose they are sir.
177224,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552326,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,We've come a long way since World War II Major.  And the lessons we've learned are all in Plan-R.
177225,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552325,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,I know that sir.
177226,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552324,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Don't fret about it Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
177227,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552323,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Perhaps Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.
177228,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552322,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do sir.
177229,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552321,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Suppose that were the case?
177230,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552319,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Because I thought it proper Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
177231,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552318,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,But then sir why have you issued the order: Wing attack Plan-R?
177232,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552317,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,And if that were true?
177233,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552316,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Well I was thinking maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
177234,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552315,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,That's a good question Major.  Maybe if you think hard you can think of the answer yourself.
177235,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552314,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Well sir I was thinking if an enemy attack is in progress how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
177236,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552313,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,You know the regulations well Major.
177237,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552312,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,And a condition red means enemy attack in progress doesn't it?
177238,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552311,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,That is correct Major.
177239,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552310,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Well General Ripper sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red aren't we?
177240,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552309,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Certainly Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
177241,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552308,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Yes sir.  General can I ask a question?
177242,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552307,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either Major.
177243,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552306,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Oh it's not my radio sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
177244,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552305,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,I see you're playing your radio Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
177245,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552304,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,That's right Major.
177246,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552303,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,Sort of like a new hobby huh General?
177247,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552302,u7920,GENERAL RIPPER,Please don't take any notice of this weapon Major.  I love all weapons and as of late I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
177248,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552301,u7927,MAJOR MANDRAKE,What's the gun for General Ripper?
177250,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552937,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
177252,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552749,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,General stick to the point please.
177254,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552747,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense when its course and target are known?
177256,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552745,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,What's the target.
177258,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552743,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Have you tried the recall again?
177259,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552741,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Yes?
177260,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552724,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,How do you know they were shot down Buck?
177261,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552723,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Hello are you still there?...Uh-huh...I'll be right back.  We're still working this thing out.
177263,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552721,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Look he's there and you're here.
177265,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552719,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,He says they've only shot down three planes.
177267,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552717,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,General Schmuck are you positive of your figures?
177268,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552675,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,General Faceman what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
177270,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552673,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,How many planes did we lose?
177273,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552669,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,How long will it take to receive them all?
177275,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552667,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
177276,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552532,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Knock it off will you General?  Crudley find out what's holding up that call!
177278,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552421,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,That's the idea General Schmuck.  Zlat!
177280,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552409,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Admiral Buldike?
177283,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552254,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,I want to talk to General Ripper.
177286,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552246,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Then there's no chance for recall?
177288,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552244,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,How could you let this happen General Schmuck?
177290,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552242,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
177292,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552240,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
177294,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552238,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Why can't you cancel it?
177296,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552236,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,What the hell is Plan-R?
177298,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552234,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
177300,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552232,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,Well what about the Positive Control the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
177302,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552230,u7928,PRESIDENT MUFFLEY,I presume the planes are armed?
177304,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552553,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
177306,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552551,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
177307,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552550,u7926,MAJOR KONG,All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.

177317,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552146,u7926,MAJOR KONG,No they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.
177320,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552497,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Maximum ECM.
177322,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552160,u7925,LT. ZOGG,He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
177324,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552158,u7925,LT. ZOGG,He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
177326,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552143,u7925,LT. ZOGG,What else could it be?
177327,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552871,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Sure I'll take her up right now.
177329,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552869,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Sure I'll take her up to eight hundred.
177331,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552759,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Hey Terry I'm hit.
177333,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552754,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Hang on boys.
177335,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552752,u7926,MAJOR KONG,If they come down low enough to make a firing pass they'll never be able to pull up in time.
177337,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552738,u7926,MAJOR KONG,They can't touch us at this height.
177339,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552736,u7926,MAJOR KONG,They must have made a visual contact.
177341,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552734,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Roger.
177343,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552710,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Lieutenant Quiffer we're all sorry you were hit and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
177345,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552708,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Come on Quentin isn't that pretty selfish putting yourself ahead of the mission?
177347,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552704,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Lieutenant Toejam why don't you help him?
177349,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552555,u7926,MAJOR KONG,We'll worry about that later.  Okay I'll take damage reports.
177351,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552496,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Maximum ECM!
177354,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552492,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Call them every five miles.
177356,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552490,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Speed?
177358,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552488,u7926,MAJOR KONG,They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
177360,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552480,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Roger keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot Ace.
177363,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552291,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Check.
177365,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552289,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Check.
177367,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552287,u7926,MAJOR KONG,A through H is correct.
177368,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552165,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Forget it Quentin.  It can happen to the best of us.  Now let's get squared away.
177371,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552139,u7926,MAJOR KONG,War.
177373,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552137,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Then this is it.
177374,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552873,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Skip it and jump damn you!  This flak's so close I can smell it.
177376,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552867,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Forget it.
177378,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552803,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Very interesting.
177381,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552792,u7926,MAJOR KONG,No kidding.
177383,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552790,u7926,MAJOR KONG,What does it look like?
177384,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552763,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Damn you Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
177386,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552761,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Listen I think I'm hit bad.
177388,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552706,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
177391,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552443,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Primary arming switch.
177393,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552441,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Lieutenant Toejam are you ready for Bim and Bam?
177394,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552170,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Primary target the ICBM base at Laputa. One weapon fused for air burst at ten thou- sand.  Second weapon to be used if first malfunctions.  Otherwise the secondary gets it - the airfield outside of Karnak.  Fused air burst at ten thousand.
177396,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552168,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114 which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?
177398,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552149,u7926,MAJOR KONG,No this looks like the real thing.
177400,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552131,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that Terry.
177403,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552127,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Yeah?
177405,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552888,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Well I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
177406,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552887,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Sure King.
177407,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552886,u7926,MAJOR KONG,I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
177408,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552885,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Forget it.
177409,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552884,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Listen Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
177410,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552883,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Thanks King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
177411,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552882,u7926,MAJOR KONG,I'd be mighty proud if you did Lothar.
177412,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552881,u7925,LT. ZOGG,King would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
177413,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552879,u7925,LT. ZOGG,I thought maybe you'd like some company.
177414,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552878,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for Lothar?
177415,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552877,u7925,LT. ZOGG,I thought I'd go along for the ride.
177416,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552876,u7926,MAJOR KONG,What the hell are you doing here Lothar?
177417,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552875,u7925,LT. ZOGG,We're on course Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.
177418,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552863,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Roger.
177419,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552862,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Well it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
177420,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552861,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
177421,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552860,u7925,LT. ZOGG,I think it's okay King.  They should go off on impact.
177422,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552857,u7926,MAJOR KONG,There's no other way boys.  I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.
177423,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552856,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Let me check.
177424,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552855,u7926,MAJOR KONG,There's no other way Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
177425,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552854,u7925,LT. ZOGG,But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
177426,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552853,u7926,MAJOR KONG,I asked you a question Lothar!
177427,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552852,u7925,LT. ZOGG,But I TOLD YOU I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
177428,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552851,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Lothar can you arm the bombs for impact?
177429,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552850,u7925,LT. ZOGG,I tried everything.  Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
177430,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552849,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Have you tried the emergency system?
177431,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552848,u7925,LT. ZOGG,But I get a red light.
177432,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552847,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Maybe the warning system's out.
177433,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552846,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Well I can't get out and look King.  But I don't get a green light.
177434,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552845,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Are you sure?
177435,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552844,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Well I hate to say this but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
177436,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552843,u7926,MAJOR KONG,I'm okay.  What's up?
177437,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552842,u7925,LT. ZOGG,It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
177438,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552841,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Who's that?
177439,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552839,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Forget it.  Okay team let's break it up and get ready for the kick-off.
177440,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552838,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Sorry King.
177441,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552837,u7926,MAJOR KONG,First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
177442,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552836,u7925,LT. ZOGG,You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
177443,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552835,u7926,MAJOR KONG,We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
177444,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552834,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Okay how do we know they didn't shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew?  How do we know that?
177445,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552833,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Come on King.  That doesn't make sense.
177446,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552832,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
177447,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552831,u7925,LT. ZOGG,But the code is made up by General Ripper and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
177448,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552830,u7926,MAJOR KONG,There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
177449,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552827,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Then get off my back!
177450,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552826,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Take it easy Major Kong.
177451,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552825,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Lieutentant Zogg how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
177452,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552824,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Look King maybe you've lost too much blood or something.
177453,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552823,u7926,MAJOR KONG,I said that's the point!
177454,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552822,u7925,LT. ZOGG,I don't get you King.
177455,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552821,u7926,MAJOR KONG,That's the point.
177456,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552820,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Right.  So how could we get any messages?
177457,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552819,u7926,MAJOR KONG,The CRM-114 is smashed right?
177458,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552818,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Like hell it does.
177459,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552817,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Then that settles it doesn't it?
177460,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552816,u7925,LT. ZOGG,But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
177461,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552815,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
177462,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552814,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Look this is different.
177463,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552813,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Lieutenant Zogg what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
177464,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552810,u7925,LT. ZOGG,How the hell do I know?  Maybe the war's over.
177465,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552809,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Why should they call us back?
177466,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552808,u7925,LT. ZOGG,They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
177467,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552807,u7926,MAJOR KONG,You tell me.
177468,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552780,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Quentin how's your gear?
177469,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552779,u7925,LT. ZOGG,I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
177470,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552776,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Listen give me a shot quick!
177471,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552775,u7925,LT. ZOGG,He's dead all right.
177472,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552774,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Hell he looks dead.
177473,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552773,u7925,LT. ZOGG,How do you know he's dead?
177474,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552772,u7926,MAJOR KONG,In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
177475,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552771,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Where'd they get you?
177476,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552770,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Sure!  Sure I'm on my way.
177477,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552769,u7926,MAJOR KONG,I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
177478,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552768,u7925,LT. ZOGG,What happened?
177479,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552767,u7926,MAJOR KONG,He's dead.
177480,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552765,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Lothar get up here fast and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad I think.
177481,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552764,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Yes Major.
177482,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552698,u7926,MAJOR KONG,Binky?
177483,m536,dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb,L552697,u7925,LT. ZOGG,Everything still checks out okay.

177704,m537,suburbia,L553178,u7932,BUFF,I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes every morning I'd get up singing man. Do my work-out take a shower followed by a hearty breakfast steak and eggs washed down with a pot of hot coffee six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd like have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow we'd snap out a few mondo lines vaporize a few million brain cells screw for about an hour then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
177705,m537,suburbia,L553177,u7936,JEFF,I'd get bored.

178176,m537,suburbia,L553214,u7936,JEFF,No no see that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see see homeless people up close and personal?

178188,m537,suburbia,L553202,u7936,JEFF,I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
178189,m537,suburbia,L553201,u7940,SOOZE,How?

178194,m537,suburbia,L553196,u7936,JEFF,Okay but nothing happened. Believe me if I thought something really bad was going to happen I would've done something.
178195,m537,suburbia,L553195,u7940,SOOZE,It got that close.
178196,m537,suburbia,L553194,u7936,JEFF,It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
178197,m537,suburbia,L553193,u7940,SOOZE,It was a racial incident.

Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.

186456,m569,the thin man,L603311,u8391,DOROTHY,I can't.
186458,m569,the thin man,L603309,u8391,DOROTHY,I can't help it.  You don't know.....
186460,m569,the thin man,L603307,u8391,DOROTHY,Oh Andy.

186469,m569,the thin man,L602870,u8398,MIMI,I'll do nothing of the sort.
186470,m569,the thin man,L602869,u8391,DOROTHY,You hand that over to the police.
186471,m569,the thin man,L602868,u8398,MIMI,It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
186472,m569,the thin man,L602867,u8391,DOROTHY,Then what are you hiding?
186473,m569,the thin man,L602866,u8398,MIMI,I didn't.
186474,m569,the thin man,L602865,u8391,DOROTHY,You took that money from Julia's hand.
186475,m569,the thin man,L602832,u8398,MIMI,Nonsense! She got at she deserved.

186480,m569,the thin man,L602740,u8391,DOROTHY,Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
186481,m569,the thin man,L602732,u8391,DOROTHY,I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
186482,m569,the thin man,L602731,u8398,MIMI,That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
186483,m569,the thin man,L602730,u8391,DOROTHY,You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
186484,m569,the thin man,L602729,u8398,MIMI,No.
186485,m569,the thin man,L602728,u8391,DOROTHY,He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
186486,m569,the thin man,L602727,u8398,MIMI,That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
186487,m569,the thin man,L602726,u8391,DOROTHY,Nothing.
186488,m569,the thin man,L602725,u8398,MIMI,What is it?
186489,m569,the thin man,L602724,u8391,DOROTHY,Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
186490,m569,the thin man,L602723,u8398,MIMI,What is it? Has he found him?
186491,m569,the thin man,L602720,u8398,MIMI,Oh here she is.
186492,m569,the thin man,L602719,u8391,DOROTHY,Give it to me.
186493,m569,the thin man,L602718,u8398,MIMI,How are you?....  Oh I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well can I take the message?
186495,m569,the thin man,L603567,u8391,DOROTHY,He didn't do it -- Nick!
186497,m569,the thin man,L602522,u8391,DOROTHY,He wouldn't say.
186499,m569,the thin man,L602520,u8391,DOROTHY,He's waiting for you.
186501,m569,the thin man,L602518,u8391,DOROTHY,Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
186503,m569,the thin man,L603583,u8400,NICK,He's been dead for three months.
186504,m569,the thin man,L603582,u8391,DOROTHY,Dead?
186505,m569,the thin man,L603505,u8391,DOROTHY,Hello Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
186506,m569,the thin man,L603504,u8400,NICK,Hello Dorothy. 
186507,m569,the thin man,L602964,u8391,DOROTHY,That's the truth.
186508,m569,the thin man,L602963,u8400,NICK,Don't lie to me.
186509,m569,the thin man,L602962,u8391,DOROTHY,I bought it in a pawn shop.
186510,m569,the thin man,L602961,u8400,NICK,Where did you get this gun?
186511,m569,the thin man,L602960,u8400,NICK,Oh yeah?  People fall toward a shot you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
186512,m569,the thin man,L602959,u8391,DOROTHY,She... she fell over backwards.
186513,m569,the thin man,L602958,u8400,NICK,Which way did she fall?
186514,m569,the thin man,L602957,u8391,DOROTHY,I don't know.
186515,m569,the thin man,L602956,u8400,NICK,Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
186516,m569,the thin man,L602955,u8391,DOROTHY,She fell down.
186517,m569,the thin man,L602954,u8400,NICK,Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
186518,m569,the thin man,L602953,u8391,DOROTHY,Why... in the heart.
186519,m569,the thin man,L602952,u8400,NICK,Where did you hit her?
186520,m569,the thin man,L602951,u8391,DOROTHY,Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me and I shot her.
186521,m569,the thin man,L602950,u8400,NICK,What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
186522,m569,the thin man,L602949,u8391,DOROTHY,There. 
186523,m569,the thin man,L602948,u8400,NICK,Yes.
186524,m569,the thin man,L602947,u8391,DOROTHY,You heard about Julia Wolf?
186525,m569,the thin man,L602940,u8391,DOROTHY,I've got to see you alone!
186526,m569,the thin man,L602939,u8400,NICK,Come on in.
186527,m569,the thin man,L602722,u8391,DOROTHY,Oh thank heaven.
186528,m569,the thin man,L602721,u8400,NICK,I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
186529,m569,the thin man,L602671,u8391,DOROTHY,Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.
186530,m569,the thin man,L602670,u8400,NICK,We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
186531,m569,the thin man,L602669,u8391,DOROTHY,How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
186532,m569,the thin man,L602667,u8391,DOROTHY,No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
186533,m569,the thin man,L602666,u8400,NICK,Your father?
186534,m569,the thin man,L602636,u8400,NICK,Why don't you try him again?
186535,m569,the thin man,L602635,u8391,DOROTHY,tried him once -
186536,m569,the thin man,L602634,u8400,NICK,That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
186537,m569,the thin man,L602633,u8391,DOROTHY,Macaulay.
186538,m569,the thin man,L602632,u8400,NICK,I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
186539,m569,the thin man,L602629,u8400,NICK,Disappeared!
186540,m569,the thin man,L602628,u8391,DOROTHY,That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
186541,m569,the thin man,L602627,u8400,NICK,Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
186542,m569,the thin man,L602626,u8391,DOROTHY,Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
186543,m569,the thin man,L602625,u8400,NICK,Probably not.
186544,m569,the thin man,L602624,u8391,DOROTHY,was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
186545,m569,the thin man,L602623,u8400,NICK,How did you ever remember me?
186546,m569,the thin man,L602622,u8391,DOROTHY,Yes.
186547,m569,the thin man,L602621,u8400,NICK,Not that scrawny little....? 
186548,m569,the thin man,L602620,u8391,DOROTHY,You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
186549,m569,the thin man,L602619,u8400,NICK,Yes.
186550,m569,the thin man,L602618,u8391,DOROTHY,Aren't you Nick Charles?
186551,m569,the thin man,L602617,u8400,NICK,Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
186552,m569,the thin man,L602616,u8391,DOROTHY,You know we know each other.
186553,m569,the thin man,L602614,u8391,DOROTHY,Hello there!
186554,m569,the thin man,L602613,u8400,NICK,Another Martini --
186555,m569,the thin man,L602510,u8406,WYNANT,Goodbye my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
186556,m569,the thin man,L602509,u8391,DOROTHY,Goodbye darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
186557,m569,the thin man,L602508,u8406,WYNANT,Better get home before it is.
186558,m569,the thin man,L602507,u8391,DOROTHY,But it isn't bad weather now.
186559,m569,the thin man,L602506,u8406,WYNANT,Only in bad weather.
186560,m569,the thin man,L602505,u8391,DOROTHY,Poor Dad does that still bother you?
186561,m569,the thin man,L602502,u8406,WYNANT,He's a brave man.
186562,m569,the thin man,L602501,u8391,DOROTHY,And he still wants to marry me!
186563,m569,the thin man,L602500,u8406,WYNANT,Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
186564,m569,the thin man,L602499,u8391,DOROTHY,You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
186565,m569,the thin man,L602498,u8406,WYNANT,I know -- I know --
186566,m569,the thin man,L602497,u8391,DOROTHY,You know how it is Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
186567,m569,the thin man,L602496,u8406,WYNANT,I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
186568,m569,the thin man,L602495,u8391,DOROTHY,He's all right.
186569,m569,the thin man,L602494,u8406,WYNANT,How's your brother?
186570,m569,the thin man,L602493,u8406,WYNANT,That's one thing I won't forget.  Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be starting.
186571,m569,the thin man,L602492,u8391,DOROTHY,It's a promise?
186572,m569,the thin man,L602491,u8406,WYNANT,Oh I'll be back before Christmas.
186573,m569,the thin man,L602490,u8391,DOROTHY,We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
186574,m569,the thin man,L602489,u8406,WYNANT,Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
186575,m569,the thin man,L602488,u8391,DOROTHY,A new invention?
186576,m569,the thin man,L602487,u8406,WYNANT,It's a secret.  I can't even tell you my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
186577,m569,the thin man,L602486,u8391,DOROTHY,Where are you going?
186578,m569,the thin man,L602485,u8406,WYNANT,Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
186579,m569,the thin man,L602484,u8406,WYNANT,If you think it'll be all right.
186580,m569,the thin man,L602483,u8391,DOROTHY,He can stay home.  Please Dad won't you?
186581,m569,the thin man,L602482,u8406,WYNANT,Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
186582,m569,the thin man,L602481,u8391,DOROTHY,This is my wedding.
186583,m569,the thin man,L602480,u8406,WYNANT,What would your mother say to that?
186584,m569,the thin man,L602479,u8391,DOROTHY,I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
186585,m569,the thin man,L602478,u8406,WYNANT,Yes she would.
186586,m569,the thin man,L602477,u8391,DOROTHY,Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
186587,m569,the thin man,L602466,u8391,DOROTHY,Dad this is what I really wanted to ask you....
186588,m569,the thin man,L602465,u8406,WYNANT,You see how much we have to say.
186589,m569,the thin man,L602464,u8391,DOROTHY,He'll still be your son-in-law!
186590,m569,the thin man,L602460,u8391,DOROTHY,Take a good look at him Dad.  Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
186591,m569,the thin man,L602459,u8406,WYNANT,Forgive me.  How are you?
186592,m569,the thin man,L602458,u8391,DOROTHY,It's been the same one for three months.
186593,m569,the thin man,L603434,u8400,NICK,Yes... yes.
186595,m569,the thin man,L603432,u8400,NICK,Shrapnel!
186596,m569,the thin man,L603423,u8400,NICK,I'm very interested in that body.
186598,m569,the thin man,L603421,u8400,NICK,Do you mind if I come down and see it?
186600,m569,the thin man,L603419,u8400,NICK,Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
186603,m569,the thin man,L603557,u8398,MIMI,What are you talking about Gilbert? You weren't there!
186605,m569,the thin man,L602840,u8398,MIMI,Children will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
186607,m569,the thin man,L602836,u8398,MIMI,I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
186609,m569,the thin man,L602834,u8398,MIMI,Gilbert!
186612,m569,the thin man,L602829,u8398,MIMI,Not a thing.
186615,m569,the thin man,L602738,u8398,MIMI,That woman!
186617,m569,the thin man,L602736,u8398,MIMI,What is it Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
186618,m569,the thin man,L603618,u8400,NICK,You see he'd been very clever. Everybody even our astute friend Guild thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
186619,m569,the thin man,L603617,u8394,GUILD,Shut up.
186620,m569,the thin man,L603594,u8400,NICK,--was Wynant's.
186621,m569,the thin man,L603593,u8394,GUILD,You mean that body-----?
186622,m569,the thin man,L603566,u8400,NICK,Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
186623,m569,the thin man,L603565,u8394,GUILD,Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
186624,m569,the thin man,L603564,u8400,NICK,No.
186625,m569,the thin man,L603563,u8394,GUILD,Are you kidding?
186626,m569,the thin man,L603426,u8400,NICK,I'll take care of him.
186627,m569,the thin man,L603425,u8394,GUILD,What're you doing here?
186628,m569,the thin man,L603414,u8394,GUILD,Just the same Wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way would he?  How long should you say this body'd been here Doc?
186629,m569,the thin man,L603413,u8400,NICK,Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
186630,m569,the thin man,L603412,u8394,GUILD,He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
186631,m569,the thin man,L603411,u8400,NICK,I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
186632,m569,the thin man,L603410,u8394,GUILD,Could this be him?
186633,m569,the thin man,L603409,u8400,NICK,Rosebreen.
186634,m569,the thin man,L603401,u8400,NICK,Extraordinarily lucky.
186635,m569,the thin man,L603400,u8394,GUILD,Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
186636,m569,the thin man,L603399,u8400,NICK,Just rolled them up and threw them in.
186637,m569,the thin man,L603337,u8394,GUILD,This is enough for me.
186638,m569,the thin man,L603336,u8400,NICK,Fifty will still get you a hundred.
186639,m569,the thin man,L603335,u8394,GUILD,I guess that cinches it eh Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
186640,m569,the thin man,L603331,u8400,NICK,She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm though - to find out where he is.
186641,m569,the thin man,L603330,u8394,GUILD,Get anything?
186642,m569,the thin man,L603280,u8400,NICK,Nunheim!
186643,m569,the thin man,L603279,u8394,GUILD,Trail him!  Trail who?
186644,m569,the thin man,L603278,u8400,NICK,I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
186645,m569,the thin man,L603277,u8394,GUILD,Who're you calling?
186646,m569,the thin man,L603276,u8400,NICK,I think we're on the right track.
186647,m569,the thin man,L603275,u8394,GUILD,Well what'd you think?
186648,m569,the thin man,L603243,u8394,GUILD,Let's go and see.  Taxi!
186649,m569,the thin man,L603242,u8400,NICK,He's holding out on you.
186650,m569,the thin man,L603241,u8394,GUILD,No.
186651,m569,the thin man,L603240,u8400,NICK,Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
186652,m569,the thin man,L603239,u8394,GUILD,Oh he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
186653,m569,the thin man,L603238,u8400,NICK,What about this Nunheim?
186654,m569,the thin man,L603236,u8394,GUILD,I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
186655,m569,the thin man,L603235,u8400,NICK,What about Jorgensen?
186656,m569,the thin man,L603234,u8394,GUILD,They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen the boy Dorothy Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
186657,m569,the thin man,L603233,u8400,NICK,I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
186658,m569,the thin man,L603232,u8394,GUILD,Who's your candidate?
186659,m569,the thin man,L603231,u8400,NICK,For one thing he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
186660,m569,the thin man,L603230,u8394,GUILD,What do you mean?
186661,m569,the thin man,L603229,u8400,NICK,Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
186662,m569,the thin man,L603228,u8394,GUILD,Nothing yet to cinch it.
186663,m569,the thin man,L603227,u8400,NICK,No proof?
186664,m569,the thin man,L603226,u8394,GUILD,Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
186665,m569,the thin man,L603225,u8400,NICK,You've been there?
186666,m569,the thin man,L603222,u8400,NICK,I thought it might be.  From now on they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
186667,m569,the thin man,L603221,u8394,GUILD,Oh that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
186668,m569,the thin man,L603220,u8400,NICK,What about the suicide?
186669,m569,the thin man,L603219,u8394,GUILD,It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
186670,m569,the thin man,L603218,u8400,NICK,So would I.
186671,m569,the thin man,L603215,u8400,NICK,Man to man I'm not.
186672,m569,the thin man,L603214,u8394,GUILD,Man to man Mr. Charles are you working on this case?
186673,m569,the thin man,L603213,u8394,GUILD,That ain't a gun any more.  The firing pin's busted - the -  Don't waste time talking about that.
186674,m569,the thin man,L603212,u8400,NICK,You mean about that gun?
186675,m569,the thin man,L603211,u8394,GUILD,You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
186676,m569,the thin man,L603134,u8394,GUILD,Okay.  There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better.  Come on.
186677,m569,the thin man,L603133,u8400,NICK,I'll have to try to remember.
186678,m569,the thin man,L603132,u8394,GUILD,Who's is it?
186679,m569,the thin man,L603131,u8400,NICK,No.
186680,m569,the thin man,L603130,u8394,GUILD,This gun yours?
186681,m569,the thin man,L603128,u8394,GUILD,Ever heard of the Sullivan Act?
186682,m569,the thin man,L603127,u8400,NICK,No.
186683,m569,the thin man,L603126,u8394,GUILD,Have you got a pistol permit?
186684,m569,the thin man,L603121,u8394,GUILD,So you say -  Go on Bob.
186685,m569,the thin man,L603120,u8400,NICK,Not without a warrant.
186686,m569,the thin man,L603119,u8400,NICK,Keep on asking.
186687,m569,the thin man,L603118,u8394,GUILD,I'm asking you.
186688,m569,the thin man,L603117,u8400,NICK,Ask him.  I don't know.
186689,m569,the thin man,L603116,u8394,GUILD,What'd he think it was to you?
186690,m569,the thin man,L603115,u8400,NICK,Nothing.
186691,m569,the thin man,L603114,u8394,GUILD,What's that to you?
186692,m569,the thin man,L603113,u8400,NICK,Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
186693,m569,the thin man,L603112,u8394,GUILD,What's he want of you?
186694,m569,the thin man,L603111,u8400,NICK,I never saw him before.
186695,m569,the thin man,L603108,u8394,GUILD,We were looking for this bird.
186696,m569,the thin man,L603107,u8400,NICK,Yes.  I might not have been shot.
186697,m569,the thin man,L603106,u8394,GUILD,We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
186698,m569,the thin man,L603105,u8400,NICK,How'd you people happen to pop in?
186699,m569,the thin man,L602822,u8394,GUILD,Well thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
186701,m569,the thin man,L602820,u8394,GUILD,Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
186704,m569,the thin man,L602814,u8394,GUILD,Did you go?
186706,m569,the thin man,L602812,u8394,GUILD,When was that?
186708,m569,the thin man,L602810,u8394,GUILD,He did!
186710,m569,the thin man,L602808,u8394,GUILD,Well what?
186712,m569,the thin man,L602806,u8394,GUILD,Oh then you did hear from him?
186714,m569,the thin man,L602799,u8394,GUILD,Seen any signs of it Bill?
186716,m569,the thin man,L602797,u8394,GUILD,When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
186717,m569,the thin man,L603572,u8394,GUILD,Let him have his say out.
186718,m569,the thin man,L603571,u8398,MIMI,That's ridiculous.
186719,m569,the thin man,L603555,u8394,GUILD,Tell 'em.
186720,m569,the thin man,L603554,u8398,MIMI,A brown suit brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red or reddish brown figures on it.
186721,m569,the thin man,L603553,u8394,GUILD,What kind of clothes was he wearing?
186722,m569,the thin man,L603548,u8398,MIMI,That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
186723,m569,the thin man,L603547,u8394,GUILD,You did!
186724,m569,the thin man,L602858,u8394,GUILD,Goodbye.
186725,m569,the thin man,L602857,u8398,MIMI,Goodbye.
186726,m569,the thin man,L602856,u8394,GUILD,That's all right.  Well we'll be going.
186727,m569,the thin man,L602853,u8394,GUILD,The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
186728,m569,the thin man,L602852,u8398,MIMI,I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
186729,m569,the thin man,L602851,u8394,GUILD,Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
186730,m569,the thin man,L602850,u8398,MIMI,No.
186731,m569,the thin man,L602849,u8394,GUILD,Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
186732,m569,the thin man,L602848,u8398,MIMI,Why yes.
186733,m569,the thin man,L602847,u8394,GUILD,You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
186734,m569,the thin man,L602846,u8398,MIMI,I see.
186735,m569,the thin man,L602845,u8394,GUILD,There are a few things we want to check up on.
186736,m569,the thin man,L603529,u8401,NORA,You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.
186737,m569,the thin man,L603528,u8394,GUILD,They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
186738,m569,the thin man,L603527,u8401,NORA,Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh there are two more to come.
186739,m569,the thin man,L603526,u8394,GUILD,I guess all the suspects are here.
186740,m569,the thin man,L603525,u8401,NORA,I think we may as well sit down.
186741,m569,the thin man,L603224,u8394,GUILD,Looks like he planned something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
186742,m569,the thin man,L603223,u8401,NORA,Do you think that Wynant did it?
186743,m569,the thin man,L603217,u8394,GUILD,I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
186744,m569,the thin man,L603216,u8401,NORA,But he's interested!
186745,m569,the thin man,L603210,u8401,NORA,Good morning Lieutenant -  Sorry.
186746,m569,the thin man,L603209,u8394,GUILD,Good morning --
186748,m569,the thin man,L603273,u8394,GUILD,How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
186750,m569,the thin man,L603271,u8394,GUILD,Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
186753,m569,the thin man,L603268,u8394,GUILD,Where were you?
186754,m569,the thin man,L603265,u8394,GUILD,Where were you?
186756,m569,the thin man,L603263,u8394,GUILD,You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
186758,m569,the thin man,L603259,u8394,GUILD,Want to take a poke at him?
186760,m569,the thin man,L603257,u8394,GUILD,Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
186763,m569,the thin man,L603252,u8394,GUILD,What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
186766,m569,the thin man,L602826,u8398,MIMI,Why you said...
186768,m569,the thin man,L602824,u8398,MIMI,and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
186769,m569,the thin man,L602764,u8398,MIMI,Chris -- Chris -- !
186771,m569,the thin man,L602762,u8398,MIMI,You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
186773,m569,the thin man,L602760,u8398,MIMI,What are you going to do?
186775,m569,the thin man,L602758,u8398,MIMI,I couldn't go near that woman.
186777,m569,the thin man,L602756,u8398,MIMI,Chris!
186779,m569,the thin man,L602754,u8398,MIMI,I know.
186781,m569,the thin man,L602752,u8398,MIMI,I'll get some.
186783,m569,the thin man,L602750,u8398,MIMI,Don't mind what she says Chris.
186784,m569,the thin man,L602597,u8406,WYNANT,Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
186786,m569,the thin man,L602595,u8406,WYNANT,What did you do with the rest?
186788,m569,the thin man,L602593,u8406,WYNANT,You're going to return every cent of it!
186790,m569,the thin man,L602591,u8406,WYNANT,Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
186792,m569,the thin man,L602589,u8406,WYNANT,They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
186794,m569,the thin man,L602587,u8406,WYNANT,I want that money right now or I'll hand you over to the police.
186796,m569,the thin man,L602585,u8406,WYNANT,That's my business.
186798,m569,the thin man,L602583,u8406,WYNANT,No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
186800,m569,the thin man,L602581,u8406,WYNANT,Now see here Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
186802,m569,the thin man,L602579,u8406,WYNANT,I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
186804,m569,the thin man,L602577,u8406,WYNANT,The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
186806,m569,the thin man,L602575,u8406,WYNANT,No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
186808,m569,the thin man,L602573,u8406,WYNANT,I don't like him.
186810,m569,the thin man,L602571,u8406,WYNANT,I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
186812,m569,the thin man,L602569,u8406,WYNANT,Who's that man?
186813,m569,the thin man,L602566,u8406,WYNANT,So I see.
186816,m569,the thin man,L603186,u8401,NORA,Oh please Nick.
186817,m569,the thin man,L603183,u8401,NORA,So did we.  I mean Sherlock here.
186820,m569,the thin man,L603177,u8401,NORA,Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
186822,m569,the thin man,L603171,u8401,NORA,Oh he's sitting up.
186823,m569,the thin man,L603169,u8401,NORA,Oh hello.  Come on in.
186825,m569,the thin man,L602708,u8401,NORA,Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh it's you.
186826,m569,the thin man,L602546,u8406,WYNANT,I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
186828,m569,the thin man,L602544,u8406,WYNANT,No.
186830,m569,the thin man,L602542,u8406,WYNANT,Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
186832,m569,the thin man,L602540,u8406,WYNANT,Thanks and goodbye.
186833,m569,the thin man,L602539,u8406,WYNANT,You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No you don't!
186835,m569,the thin man,L602537,u8406,WYNANT,No.
186837,m569,the thin man,L602535,u8406,WYNANT,I trust you.
186839,m569,the thin man,L602533,u8406,WYNANT,Never mind.
186841,m569,the thin man,L602531,u8406,WYNANT,That's just why I'm going.
186843,m569,the thin man,L602529,u8406,WYNANT,I'm not telling anyone.
186845,m569,the thin man,L602527,u8406,WYNANT,Did you get my money?
186846,m569,the thin man,L603626,u8400,NICK,What about it Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
186848,m569,the thin man,L603608,u8400,NICK,Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming Mimi to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
186851,m569,the thin man,L603192,u8400,NICK,Hello.... oh just a minute.  Police department?
186853,m569,the thin man,L603190,u8400,NICK,It wouldn't hurt to put it in.
186855,m569,the thin man,L603188,u8400,NICK,It might.
186856,m569,the thin man,L603185,u8400,NICK,Slim.
186858,m569,the thin man,L603175,u8400,NICK,That's all right.
186860,m569,the thin man,L603173,u8400,NICK,How are you?
186861,m569,the thin man,L602712,u8400,NICK,S'long.
186863,m569,the thin man,L602710,u8400,NICK,My wife.
186865,m569,the thin man,L602703,u8400,NICK,No word at all?
186867,m569,the thin man,L602701,u8400,NICK,What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
186869,m569,the thin man,L602699,u8400,NICK,My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
186871,m569,the thin man,L602697,u8400,NICK,I haven't been a detective for four years.
186873,m569,the thin man,L602695,u8400,NICK,Mimi?  ...  Oh Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
186875,m569,the thin man,L602693,u8400,NICK,That's all right.  What are you drinking?
186877,m569,the thin man,L602691,u8400,NICK,Hello Macaulay.  Come in.
186879,m569,the thin man,L603624,u8400,NICK,Macaulay you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off wasn't she if she re-married?
186880,m569,the thin man,L603623,u8398,MIMI,I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
186881,m569,the thin man,L603622,u8400,NICK,You're lying Mimi.  But then you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
186882,m569,the thin man,L603621,u8398,MIMI,It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
186883,m569,the thin man,L603620,u8400,NICK,What did he pay you Mimi to stick to that story?
186884,m569,the thin man,L603619,u8398,MIMI,Nobody told me.  I did see him!
186885,m569,the thin man,L603596,u8400,NICK,And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
186886,m569,the thin man,L603595,u8398,MIMI,Perfectly absurd.
186887,m569,the thin man,L603592,u8400,NICK,So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
186888,m569,the thin man,L603591,u8398,MIMI,Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why you said yourself you saw him last night.
186889,m569,the thin man,L603552,u8398,MIMI,He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
186890,m569,the thin man,L603551,u8400,NICK,Oh did he?  What did he say?
186891,m569,the thin man,L603550,u8398,MIMI,Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
186892,m569,the thin man,L603549,u8400,NICK,You did... where?
186893,m569,the thin man,L603546,u8400,NICK,I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
186894,m569,the thin man,L603545,u8398,MIMI,This is all very pleasant but why are here?
186895,m569,the thin man,L603303,u8398,MIMI,All right then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
186896,m569,the thin man,L603302,u8400,NICK,They'll want more than your word for that.
186897,m569,the thin man,L603301,u8398,MIMI,I tell you -- he didn't do it.
186898,m569,the thin man,L603300,u8400,NICK,That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
186899,m569,the thin man,L603299,u8398,MIMI,But he has nothing to do with it!
186900,m569,the thin man,L603298,u8400,NICK,You should have told them he'd disappeared.
186901,m569,the thin man,L603297,u8398,MIMI,Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
186902,m569,the thin man,L603012,u8400,NICK,Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
186903,m569,the thin man,L603011,u8398,MIMI,Where's Gilbert?
186904,m569,the thin man,L603003,u8400,NICK,Yes...
186905,m569,the thin man,L603002,u8398,MIMI,Dorothy!  Is she here?
186906,m569,the thin man,L603001,u8400,NICK,I tell you again I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
186907,m569,the thin man,L603000,u8398,MIMI,But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
186908,m569,the thin man,L602999,u8400,NICK,Now Mimi there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
186909,m569,the thin man,L602998,u8398,MIMI,Nick you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
186910,m569,the thin man,L602996,u8398,MIMI,You're always teasing.
186911,m569,the thin man,L602995,u8400,NICK,Well don't you?
186912,m569,the thin man,L602994,u8398,MIMI,Oh I know he didn't but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
186913,m569,the thin man,L602993,u8400,NICK,What do you think?
186914,m569,the thin man,L602992,u8398,MIMI,Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
186915,m569,the thin man,L602986,u8398,MIMI,want to talk to you about something very important.
186916,m569,the thin man,L602985,u8400,NICK,Hello Mimi.
186917,m569,the thin man,L602984,u8398,MIMI,Oh Nick... Nick!
186918,m569,the thin man,L603599,u8400,NICK,I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food isn't it?
186920,m569,the thin man,L603577,u8400,NICK,Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment he found out that Julia was cheating him and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner don't you...?
186922,m569,the thin man,L603575,u8400,NICK,Why do you say that?
186924,m569,the thin man,L603573,u8400,NICK,Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
186925,m569,the thin man,L603085,u8400,NICK,This is your party.
186927,m569,the thin man,L603083,u8400,NICK,I am on the level. If I knew anything I'd....
186929,m569,the thin man,L603081,u8400,NICK,I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
186931,m569,the thin man,L603079,u8400,NICK,How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
186932,m569,the thin man,L603077,u8400,NICK,That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
186934,m569,the thin man,L603075,u8400,NICK,Why tell me?
186936,m569,the thin man,L603073,u8400,NICK,All right - you didn't.
186938,m569,the thin man,L603071,u8400,NICK,I've never heard about you.
186939,m569,the thin man,L603067,u8400,NICK,Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care but I'm in a delicate condition.
186941,m569,the thin man,L603614,u8400,NICK,His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut and when Nunheim threatened him again he bumped him off.
186942,m569,the thin man,L603613,u8401,NORA,I hope you're well.
186943,m569,the thin man,L603612,u8400,NICK,It's the only way it makes sense.
186944,m569,the thin man,L603611,u8401,NORA,Why are you saying it?
186945,m569,the thin man,L603610,u8400,NICK,I don't know.
186946,m569,the thin man,L603609,u8401,NORA,Is that true?
186947,m569,the thin man,L603606,u8400,NICK,After our hero had killed Wynant he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay signing Wynant's name so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
186948,m569,the thin man,L603605,u8401,NORA,If that knife is missing I'll look for it in your back.
186949,m569,the thin man,L603581,u8400,NICK,Let's see... where was I?  Oh yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead Dorothy.
186950,m569,the thin man,L603580,u8401,NORA,You're going to drive me crazy!
186951,m569,the thin man,L603562,u8400,NICK,I'm afraid you're lying Mimi. You see I really did see Wynant last night.
186952,m569,the thin man,L603561,u8401,NORA,Serve the nuts - I mean serve the guests the nuts.
186953,m569,the thin man,L603544,u8400,NICK,I wish you'd tell me.
186954,m569,the thin man,L603543,u8401,NORA,I wish you'd tell me who.
186955,m569,the thin man,L603542,u8400,NICK,Yes.
186956,m569,the thin man,L603541,u8401,NORA,I can't wait any longer.  Tell me do you think one of them did it?
186957,m569,the thin man,L603540,u8400,NICK,Thank you Mrs. Charles.
186958,m569,the thin man,L603539,u8401,NORA,You give such charming parties Mr. Charles.
186959,m569,the thin man,L603499,u8400,NICK,Mimi Jorgensen Morelli Tanner..... 
186960,m569,the thin man,L603498,u8401,NORA,Mimi!
186961,m569,the thin man,L603497,u8400,NICK,Mimi...
186962,m569,the thin man,L603496,u8401,NORA,Who do you think did it?
186963,m569,the thin man,L603495,u8400,NICK,Oh they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
186964,m569,the thin man,L603494,u8401,NORA,The suspects!  They won't come.
186965,m569,the thin man,L603493,u8400,NICK,I'm going to give a party and invite all of the suspects.
186966,m569,the thin man,L603492,u8401,NORA,I've got a lulu -- why?
186967,m569,the thin man,L603491,u8400,NICK,Got a nice evening dress?
186968,m569,the thin man,L603490,u8401,NORA,Now Nick what's that got to do with it?
186969,m569,the thin man,L603489,u8400,NICK,Got a nice evening dress?
186970,m569,the thin man,L603488,u8401,NORA,Yes!
186971,m569,the thin man,L603487,u8400,NICK,I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
186972,m569,the thin man,L603486,u8401,NORA,What are you going to do?
186973,m569,the thin man,L603485,u8400,NICK,I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
186974,m569,the thin man,L603484,u8401,NORA,Why not?
186975,m569,the thin man,L603483,u8400,NICK,I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
186976,m569,the thin man,L603482,u8401,NORA,But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
186977,m569,the thin man,L603481,u8400,NICK,Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
186978,m569,the thin man,L603480,u8401,NORA,I'm going to tell her.
186979,m569,the thin man,L603479,u8400,NICK,No.  Nobody but you.
186980,m569,the thin man,L603478,u8401,NORA,Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
186981,m569,the thin man,L603477,u8400,NICK,Smart gal.
186982,m569,the thin man,L603476,u8401,NORA,Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
186983,m569,the thin man,L603475,u8400,NICK,Couple of months anyway.
186984,m569,the thin man,L603474,u8401,NORA,How long has he been dead?
186985,m569,the thin man,L603473,u8400,NICK,I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
186986,m569,the thin man,L603472,u8401,NORA,You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
186987,m569,the thin man,L603471,u8400,NICK,Sure.
186988,m569,the thin man,L603470,u8401,NORA,Well don't they?
186989,m569,the thin man,L603469,u8400,NICK,Oh.  Well the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
186990,m569,the thin man,L603468,u8401,NORA,What things made you so sure?
186991,m569,the thin man,L603467,u8400,NICK,Huh?
186992,m569,the thin man,L603466,u8401,NORA,Nick you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
186993,m569,the thin man,L603465,u8400,NICK,Several things.  Hello Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah and lots of onions.  Oh and coffee.
186994,m569,the thin man,L603464,u8401,NORA,What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
186995,m569,the thin man,L603463,u8400,NICK,That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
186996,m569,the thin man,L603462,u8401,NORA,But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
186997,m569,the thin man,L603461,u8400,NICK,Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
186998,m569,the thin man,L603460,u8401,NORA,Wynant's body?
186999,m569,the thin man,L603459,u8400,NICK,That's a fact.
187000,m569,the thin man,L603458,u8401,NORA,Nick you'd better lay off that liquor.
187001,m569,the thin man,L603457,u8400,NICK,It was his body that was buried there.
187002,m569,the thin man,L603456,u8401,NORA,Nick!
187003,m569,the thin man,L603455,u8400,NICK,He was down in the shop.
187004,m569,the thin man,L603454,u8401,NORA,What do you mean?
187005,m569,the thin man,L603453,u8400,NICK,I did find him!
187006,m569,the thin man,L603452,u8401,NORA,I want you to stay and find Wynant.
187007,m569,the thin man,L603451,u8400,NICK,My soul woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
187008,m569,the thin man,L603450,u8401,NORA,Back to California
187009,m569,the thin man,L603366,u8401,NORA,I don't care - I'm just used to you that's all --  If you let anything happen to him you'll never wag that tail again!
187010,m569,the thin man,L603365,u8400,NICK,Why I believe the little woman cares.
187011,m569,the thin man,L603364,u8401,NORA,Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
187012,m569,the thin man,L603363,u8400,NICK,Sure I will.
187013,m569,the thin man,L603362,u8401,NORA,Nickie take care of yourself won't you?
187014,m569,the thin man,L603361,u8400,NICK,Goodbye darling.
187015,m569,the thin man,L603360,u8401,NORA,You dog!
187016,m569,the thin man,L603359,u8400,NICK,Not with all your money!
187017,m569,the thin man,L603358,u8401,NORA,You bet I wouldn't.
187018,m569,the thin man,L603357,u8400,NICK,You wouldn't be a widow long.
187019,m569,the thin man,L603356,u8401,NORA,Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
187020,m569,the thin man,L603355,u8400,NICK,I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
187021,m569,the thin man,L603354,u8401,NORA,I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
187022,m569,the thin man,L603353,u8400,NICK,Say you're the one who got me in this!
187023,m569,the thin man,L603352,u8401,NORA,Nick - I won't have you going down there.
187024,m569,the thin man,L603351,u8400,NICK,I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
187025,m569,the thin man,L603350,u8401,NORA,You mean he might be hiding there?
187026,m569,the thin man,L603349,u8400,NICK,He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
187027,m569,the thin man,L603348,u8401,NORA,Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
187028,m569,the thin man,L603347,u8400,NICK,I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop I want to find out why it's closed.
187029,m569,the thin man,L603346,u8401,NORA,What are you going to do?
187030,m569,the thin man,L603345,u8400,NICK,Looks like a hold-up!
187031,m569,the thin man,L603344,u8401,NORA,What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
187032,m569,the thin man,L603343,u8400,NICK,We're going sightseeing -- aren't we Asta?
187033,m569,the thin man,L603342,u8401,NORA,He's just been for a walk.
187034,m569,the thin man,L603341,u8400,NICK,I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
187035,m569,the thin man,L603340,u8401,NORA,I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
187036,m569,the thin man,L603245,u8401,NORA,Catch me letting you go alone!
187037,m569,the thin man,L603244,u8400,NICK,This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
187038,m569,the thin man,L603208,u8400,NICK,Come on Watson we're going places.
187039,m569,the thin man,L603207,u8401,NORA,So am I.
187040,m569,the thin man,L603206,u8400,NICK,No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
187041,m569,the thin man,L603205,u8401,NORA,Why don't you?
187042,m569,the thin man,L603204,u8400,NICK,I don't believe he did it.
187043,m569,the thin man,L603203,u8401,NORA,But Wynant --- ?
187044,m569,the thin man,L603202,u8400,NICK,Maybe I will.
187045,m569,the thin man,L603201,u8401,NORA,The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
187046,m569,the thin man,L603200,u8400,NICK,What's the matter with you?
187047,m569,the thin man,L603199,u8401,NORA,What's the trouble Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
187048,m569,the thin man,L603198,u8401,NORA,All right hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs.
187049,m569,the thin man,L603197,u8400,NICK,You talk as if I were Asta.
187050,m569,the thin man,L603196,u8401,NORA,Sit down!
187051,m569,the thin man,L603195,u8400,NICK,It's not going to hurt me to get up.
187052,m569,the thin man,L603194,u8401,NORA,Well that's that.  Stay there Nick!
187053,m569,the thin man,L603181,u8401,NORA,Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
187054,m569,the thin man,L603180,u8400,NICK,Oh it's a fire hydrant.
187055,m569,the thin man,L603168,u8401,NORA,Oh take it!  Please take it!
187056,m569,the thin man,L603167,u8400,NICK,Your guess is as good as mine.
187057,m569,the thin man,L603166,u8401,NORA,He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
187058,m569,the thin man,L603165,u8400,NICK,I don't know.
187059,m569,the thin man,L603164,u8401,NORA,Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it did he Nick?
187060,m569,the thin man,L603163,u8400,NICK,Let's see.  Where's it from?
187061,m569,the thin man,L603160,u8401,NORA,Yes.
187062,m569,the thin man,L603159,u8400,NICK,Did I give it to you?
187063,m569,the thin man,L603158,u8401,NORA,Yes.
187064,m569,the thin man,L603157,u8400,NICK,Is that another Christmas present?
187065,m569,the thin man,L603156,u8401,NORA,I'm stifling but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
187066,m569,the thin man,L603155,u8400,NICK,Aren't you hot in that?
187067,m569,the thin man,L603153,u8400,NICK,Macaulay.
187068,m569,the thin man,L603152,u8401,NORA,Who's that?
187069,m569,the thin man,L603151,u8400,NICK,Hello... send him up.
187070,m569,the thin man,L603150,u8400,NICK,That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
187071,m569,the thin man,L603149,u8401,NORA,I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
187072,m569,the thin man,L603148,u8400,NICK,Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
187073,m569,the thin man,L603147,u8401,NORA,Finished with these?
187074,m569,the thin man,L603146,u8400,NICK,You must admit I have good taste.
187075,m569,the thin man,L603145,u8401,NORA,You did.
187076,m569,the thin man,L603144,u8400,NICK,Who gave it to you?
187077,m569,the thin man,L603143,u8401,NORA,No.  It's a Christmas present.
187078,m569,the thin man,L603142,u8400,NICK,I never saw that before.
187079,m569,the thin man,L603140,u8401,NORA,Well didn't you?
187080,m569,the thin man,L603139,u8400,NICK,On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
187081,m569,the thin man,L603138,u8401,NORA,He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
187082,m569,the thin man,L603137,u8400,NICK,You're a fine watch dog.
187083,m569,the thin man,L603136,u8400,NICK,He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!

187104,m569,the thin man,L603051,u8400,NICK,Darling my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
187105,m569,the thin man,L603050,u8401,NORA,She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could would it?
187106,m569,the thin man,L603049,u8400,NICK,There's nothing I can do to help her.
187107,m569,the thin man,L603048,u8401,NORA,That poor girl is in a tough spot.

187116,m569,the thin man,L603039,u8400,NICK,Can't you get to sleep?
187117,m569,the thin man,L603038,u8401,NORA,Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while just for the fun of it?
187118,m569,the thin man,L603037,u8400,NICK,That's jolly.
187119,m569,the thin man,L603036,u8401,NORA,Good. I want to talk to you.

187124,m569,the thin man,L602973,u8400,NICK,Nothing 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
187125,m569,the thin man,L602972,u8401,NORA,What are you going to do with it?
187126,m569,the thin man,L602971,u8400,NICK,She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
187127,m569,the thin man,L602970,u8401,NORA,Where did you get that?

187132,m569,the thin man,L602927,u8401,NORA,Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
187133,m569,the thin man,L602926,u8401,NORA,Room service please -
187134,m569,the thin man,L602925,u8400,NICK,I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
187135,m569,the thin man,L602924,u8401,NORA,I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
187136,m569,the thin man,L602918,u8401,NORA,We need ice.

188719,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615577,u8476,SHORTIE,Now you're talkin'!
188720,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615576,u8467,BRETT,Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
188721,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615575,u8476,SHORTIE,Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
188722,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615574,u8467,BRETT,Shortie!--you know my motto?
188723,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615569,u8467,BRETT,A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
188724,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615568,u8476,SHORTIE,Change?
188725,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615567,u8467,BRETT,My change.
188726,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615566,u8476,SHORTIE,No sir?
188727,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615565,u8467,BRETT,Just a minute steward--haven't you forgotten something?
188728,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615561,u8467,BRETT,Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
188729,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615560,u8476,SHORTIE,Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
188730,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615559,u8467,BRETT,She was wearing a white dress with a cute black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
188731,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615558,u8476,SHORTIE,This is a business trip!
188732,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615557,u8467,BRETT,A thousand? She's one in a million--right off the top of the rosebush!
188733,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615556,u8476,SHORTIE,--there's thousands of 'em!
188734,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615555,u8467,BRETT,Oh Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
188735,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615554,u8476,SHORTIE,Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.
188736,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615553,u8467,BRETT,Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
188737,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615552,u8476,SHORTIE,Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
188738,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615551,u8467,BRETT,Come on--  I'll promote a card game and we'll be sitting pretty.
188739,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615550,u8476,SHORTIE,Not a chance.
188740,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615549,u8467,BRETT,I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
188741,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615548,u8476,SHORTIE,A dollar forty.
188742,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615547,u8467,BRETT,How're the tips?
188743,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615546,u8476,SHORTIE,Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
188744,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615545,u8467,BRETT,Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up weren't you?
188745,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615544,u8476,SHORTIE,Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
188746,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615448,u8467,BRETT,Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
188747,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615447,u8476,SHORTIE,You don't think--?
188748,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615440,u8467,BRETT,Shortie look!
188749,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615439,u8476,SHORTIE,You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
188750,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615435,u8476,SHORTIE,Oh no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
188751,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615434,u8467,BRETT,Quick let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
188752,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615427,u8476,SHORTIE,I'll watch for him sir.
188753,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615426,u8467,BRETT,He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
188754,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615425,u8476,SHORTIE,Yes sir!--I will sir--Certainly sir!
188755,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615424,u8467,BRETT,Nix the law!
188756,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615423,u8476,SHORTIE,I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents. 
188757,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615422,u8467,BRETT,No you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
188758,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615421,u8476,SHORTIE,A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
188759,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615420,u8467,BRETT,It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
188760,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615419,u8476,SHORTIE,Oh I'm not squawkin' but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
188761,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615418,u8467,BRETT,No bank roll there boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
188762,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615417,u8476,SHORTIE,We coulda got two third-class!
188763,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615416,u8467,BRETT,We didn't have enough dough for two tickets did we?
188764,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615415,u8476,SHORTIE,If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
188765,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615414,u8467,BRETT,I thought you were a smart guy.
188766,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615413,u8476,SHORTIE,Oh putting on the swell eh?
188767,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615412,u8467,BRETT,Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
188768,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615411,u8467,BRETT,Not here--follow me around the shed.
188769,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616375,u8467,BRETT,Make it three boys--I'll play this hand pat.
188771,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616370,u8467,BRETT,Think again--
188773,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616366,u8467,BRETT,Why isn't that a good time to quit?
188775,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616364,u8467,BRETT,Well to tell you the truth gentlemen I've sworn off playing poker.
188776,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616086,u8467,BRETT,Much better--thank you--
188778,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615918,u8467,BRETT,It's a pleasure.
188781,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615900,u8467,BRETT,Three Jacks.
188783,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615898,u8467,BRETT,I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.
188784,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615881,u8467,BRETT,Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
188786,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616527,u8472,MCKINNEY,Thanks. That makes us square.
188787,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616526,u8467,BRETT,Here's your fifty.
188788,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616485,u8467,BRETT,Why I--
188789,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616484,u8472,MCKINNEY,Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now Jimmy what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
188790,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616476,u8472,MCKINNEY,You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
188791,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616475,u8467,BRETT,Don't get yourself all worked up--
188792,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616464,u8472,MCKINNEY,Don't be too smart Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
188793,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616463,u8467,BRETT,Thought you might need me--don't talk kid and don't let him scare you-- 
188794,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616350,u8467,BRETT,Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
188795,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616349,u8472,MCKINNEY,Nice girl that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
188796,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616346,u8467,BRETT,It's a bet--come on Sally!
188797,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616345,u8472,MCKINNEY,Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred though--just fifty.
188798,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616273,u8472,MCKINNEY,Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
188799,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616272,u8467,BRETT,Coming to the pool for a swim?
188800,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616271,u8472,MCKINNEY,Hello young fellow!
188801,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616249,u8472,MCKINNEY,Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs-- like this--in case they got what you're looking for attached to a string.  See what I mean Purser?
188802,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616248,u8467,BRETT,Hey!--you're tickling me.
188803,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616247,u8472,MCKINNEY,This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember Purser when you're searching anybody take the lining of their coat like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
188804,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616246,u8467,BRETT,How about trying your fine Italian hand?
188805,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616245,u8472,MCKINNEY,It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
188806,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616243,u8467,BRETT,Swell!
188807,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616242,u8472,MCKINNEY,I'll go with you.
188808,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616241,u8467,BRETT,Sure I'll go.
188809,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616240,u8472,MCKINNEY,Well someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
188810,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616239,u8467,BRETT,Why?
188811,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616238,u8472,MCKINNEY,You know what I'd do if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
188812,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616237,u8467,BRETT,No thanks. I've promised to play cards.
188813,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616236,u8472,MCKINNEY,How about you?
188814,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616231,u8472,MCKINNEY,Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
188815,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616230,u8467,BRETT,Thought you were going to turn in Inspector.
188816,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616183,u8467,BRETT,Good night!
188817,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616182,u8472,MCKINNEY,No thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
188818,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616181,u8467,BRETT,I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap Inspector?
188819,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616177,u8472,MCKINNEY,I wouldn't be surprised--
188820,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616176,u8467,BRETT,If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
188821,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616175,u8472,MCKINNEY,Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
188822,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616174,u8467,BRETT,It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this Inspector--
188823,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616173,u8472,MCKINNEY,Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
188824,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616172,u8467,BRETT,This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
188825,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616146,u8472,MCKINNEY,No thanks--I never gambled in my life.
188826,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616145,u8467,BRETT,Care to join us?
188827,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616110,u8472,MCKINNEY,I'll go with you--
188828,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616109,u8467,BRETT,I'm going to the show--
188829,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615774,u8472,MCKINNEY,No--not quite.
188830,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615773,u8467,BRETT,Yours too. Are you the McKinney the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
188831,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615772,u8472,MCKINNEY,Before that. Your face is very familiar.
188832,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615771,u8467,BRETT,Oh yes. On the pier.
188833,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615770,u8472,MCKINNEY,I think I've met you before Mr. Brett.
188834,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616502,u8469,DENBY,If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard-- 
188835,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616501,u8467,BRETT,What's that?
188836,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616500,u8469,DENBY,O.K. kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
188837,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616499,u8467,BRETT,Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
188838,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616498,u8469,DENBY,Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
188839,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616497,u8467,BRETT,She did?
188840,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616496,u8469,DENBY,I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
188841,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616047,u8469,DENBY,Good!  At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
188842,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616046,u8467,BRETT,I should say not.
188843,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616045,u8469,DENBY,I don't know what it is but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
188844,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615989,u8469,DENBY,I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
188845,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615988,u8467,BRETT,She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
188846,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615987,u8469,DENBY,No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
188847,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615986,u8467,BRETT,Oh Denby--have you seen Sally around?
188848,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615840,u8469,DENBY,Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
188849,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615839,u8467,BRETT,Wait a minute--let's match for it.
188850,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615838,u8469,DENBY,That's all right. I'll attend to this.
188851,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615786,u8469,DENBY,I'm sorry to hear that.
188852,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615785,u8467,BRETT,I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
188853,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615784,u8469,DENBY,That's too bad.
188854,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615781,u8469,DENBY,O.K. Heads you win.
188855,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615780,u8467,BRETT,Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
188856,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615779,u8469,DENBY,No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
188857,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615776,u8467,BRETT,Now that that's settled why not make the game a foursome?
188858,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615775,u8469,DENBY,Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
188860,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615752,u8476,SHORTIE,Well there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
188862,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615750,u8476,SHORTIE,Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name doesn't she?
188864,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615748,u8476,SHORTIE,That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
188867,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615744,u8476,SHORTIE,Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
188869,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615741,u8476,SHORTIE,Cut it out.
188871,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615739,u8476,SHORTIE,Your wife knows that don't she?
188876,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615731,u8476,SHORTIE,Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
188878,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615728,u8476,SHORTIE,Then you don't have to tell her--cut out New York.
188880,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615726,u8476,SHORTIE,Your wife knows that don't she?
188882,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615724,u8476,SHORTIE,Where do you live?
188884,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615722,u8476,SHORTIE,Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
188886,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615716,u8476,SHORTIE,Here you are sir. 
188887,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616341,u8469,DENBY,All right folks get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
188889,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616339,u8469,DENBY,Well you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
188891,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616337,u8469,DENBY,Come on get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.
188893,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615718,u8469,DENBY,Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
188895,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615714,u8469,DENBY,Hey boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
188897,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615712,u8469,DENBY,This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
188899,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615710,u8469,DENBY,Well did you find me?
188901,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615708,u8469,DENBY,I thought I put you to bed.
188904,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615529,u8469,DENBY,I can see where I won't talk much to you.
188906,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615525,u8469,DENBY,Yes--Me--in person!
188908,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615523,u8469,DENBY,That's me!
188910,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615519,u8469,DENBY,Knots!
188912,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615517,u8469,DENBY,No. <U>Knots</U>!
188914,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615515,u8469,DENBY,Oh--we're doing about thirty--
188923,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616483,u8469,DENBY,Yes!
188924,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616482,u8472,MCKINNEY,Is this your gun?
188925,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616481,u8469,DENBY,Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
188926,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616480,u8472,MCKINNEY,He asked for a loan of it didn't he?
188927,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616479,u8469,DENBY,I didn't--
188928,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616283,u8472,MCKINNEY,Yeah--
188929,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616282,u8469,DENBY,Maybe he just travels in bad company.
188930,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616281,u8472,MCKINNEY,Well I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
188931,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616280,u8469,DENBY,Oh nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
188932,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616279,u8472,MCKINNEY,Well I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
188933,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616278,u8469,DENBY,I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
188934,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616277,u8472,MCKINNEY,Yes a bracelet's been lost but I'm still on my vacation.
188935,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616276,u8469,DENBY,Hello Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
188936,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615849,u8472,MCKINNEY,Oh no--I don't want to impose on you--  It's funny about that billfold--I could have sworn I had it- 
188937,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615848,u8469,DENBY,It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
188938,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615847,u8472,MCKINNEY,He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
188939,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615846,u8469,DENBY,It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
188940,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615845,u8472,MCKINNEY,Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
188941,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615815,u8469,DENBY,Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
188942,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615814,u8472,MCKINNEY,You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
188943,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615811,u8469,DENBY,Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game.  Hey! When you get through with that conference shoot that last disk!
188944,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615810,u8472,MCKINNEY,Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
188945,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615809,u8469,DENBY,Here we are folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
188946,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615766,u8469,DENBY,Miss Marsh.
188947,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615765,u8472,MCKINNEY,McKinney's the name.
188948,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616402,u8469,DENBY,Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
188949,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616401,u8475,SALLY,Why--don't you like him?
188950,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616400,u8475,SALLY,Very--
188951,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616399,u8469,DENBY,Very serious?
188952,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616398,u8475,SALLY,Yes.
188953,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615793,u8469,DENBY,<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter Brett.
188954,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615792,u8475,SALLY,I don't get the humor of that remark.
188955,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615791,u8469,DENBY,What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
188956,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615790,u8475,SALLY,You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
188957,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615622,u8469,DENBY,Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
188958,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615621,u8475,SALLY,Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
188959,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615620,u8469,DENBY,I'll never love anybody else.
188960,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615619,u8475,SALLY,Come on now--you've forgotten all about that.
188961,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615618,u8469,DENBY,But not nice enough to marry--eh?
188962,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615617,u8475,SALLY,Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
188963,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615616,u8469,DENBY,Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
188964,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615615,u8475,SALLY,Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
188965,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615614,u8469,DENBY,I felt pretty low Sally when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
188966,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615613,u8475,SALLY,I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
188967,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615612,u8469,DENBY,I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that too?
188968,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615611,u8475,SALLY,It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
188969,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615610,u8469,DENBY,News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
188970,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615609,u8475,SALLY,You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why but I guess you know.
188971,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615608,u8469,DENBY,Do what--
188972,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615607,u8475,SALLY,I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
188973,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615606,u8469,DENBY,No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
188974,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615605,u8475,SALLY,Still got my picture I see--I was pretty dumb then wasn't I Chad?
188975,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615604,u8469,DENBY,No--not much--excepting-- 
188976,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615603,u8475,SALLY,You never fail at anything do you Chad?
188977,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615602,u8469,DENBY,Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
188978,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615601,u8475,SALLY,And you've put it over--haven't you?
188979,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615600,u8469,DENBY,Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see Sally I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
188980,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615599,u8475,SALLY,Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
188981,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615598,u8469,DENBY,Like it?
188982,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615597,u8475,SALLY,Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
188983,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615596,u8475,SALLY,Just what the doctor ordered.
188984,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615595,u8469,DENBY,Everything O.K.?
188985,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615594,u8475,SALLY,Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
188986,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615593,u8469,DENBY,You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
188987,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615592,u8475,SALLY,Am I a member of this club?
188988,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615395,u8475,SALLY,Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
188989,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615394,u8469,DENBY,Are you happy?
188990,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615393,u8475,SALLY,Well that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
188991,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616411,u8469,DENBY,You don't shoot squirrels.
188992,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616410,u8470,LOTHER,Meaning what?
188993,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616409,u8469,DENBY,I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
188994,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616408,u8470,LOTHER,Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
188995,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616407,u8469,DENBY,Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
188996,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616406,u8470,LOTHER,What do you mean?
188997,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616405,u8469,DENBY,I'll give you another chance to tell the truth Lother.
188998,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616533,u8469,DENBY,Good-night folks.
189000,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616123,u8469,DENBY,Oh--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
189003,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615983,u8469,DENBY,H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
189005,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615511,u8469,DENBY,Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right you'll get the raise!
189007,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615509,u8469,DENBY,All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
189009,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615507,u8469,DENBY,So what?
189011,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615505,u8469,DENBY,So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
189013,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615503,u8469,DENBY,What's he got that I haven't got?
189015,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615501,u8469,DENBY,Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
189017,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615352,u8469,DENBY,Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
189019,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615350,u8469,DENBY,All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
189021,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615348,u8469,DENBY,Everyone but me--what do you want now Mary?
189023,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615345,u8469,DENBY,Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
189025,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615343,u8469,DENBY,H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
189027,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615341,u8469,DENBY,What's the matter Mary?
189029,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615339,u8469,DENBY,Very good Mary--
189031,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615337,u8469,DENBY,Well let's hear the poem--
189033,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615335,u8469,DENBY,But Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
189035,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615333,u8469,DENBY,Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want Mary?
189036,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616210,u8469,DENBY,Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.
189038,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616208,u8469,DENBY,What for?
189040,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616206,u8469,DENBY,What happened to you?
189042,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615590,u8469,DENBY,Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
189045,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615928,u8470,LOTHER,I went for four.
189047,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615926,u8470,LOTHER,How much did you lose?
189048,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615913,u8470,LOTHER,Well I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
189050,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615871,u8470,LOTHER,Better unlock the door.  Sit up darling and be dignified.
189052,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615869,u8470,LOTHER,The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
189054,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615867,u8470,LOTHER,Can you read 'em Jack?
189055,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615680,u8470,LOTHER,Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
189059,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615673,u8470,LOTHER,You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
189060,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616419,u8475,SALLY,Not a chance--I'm through. 
189061,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616418,u8470,LOTHER,I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
189062,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616196,u8470,LOTHER,I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
189063,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616195,u8475,SALLY,Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
189064,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616194,u8470,LOTHER,Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
189065,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616193,u8475,SALLY,I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
189066,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616192,u8470,LOTHER,Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
189067,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615999,u8470,LOTHER,Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
189068,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615998,u8475,SALLY,Don't Lee--that's dead.
189069,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615997,u8470,LOTHER,That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
189070,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615996,u8475,SALLY,--and you swear when you get to the other side you'll never come near either of us again?
189071,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615995,u8470,LOTHER,Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
189072,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615994,u8475,SALLY,I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
189073,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615976,u8475,SALLY,You can't bluff me any more.
189074,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615975,u8470,LOTHER,Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
189075,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615974,u8475,SALLY,Not because of Ned.
189076,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615971,u8470,LOTHER,Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
189077,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615970,u8475,SALLY,--you'd go with him!
189078,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615969,u8470,LOTHER,A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
189079,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615968,u8475,SALLY,You leave the kid alone.
189080,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615967,u8470,LOTHER,Thanks to me.
189081,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615966,u8475,SALLY,He's all right.
189082,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615965,u8470,LOTHER,That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
189083,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615964,u8475,SALLY,You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
189084,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615963,u8470,LOTHER,Get wise to yourself Sally--you're no sob story.
189085,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615962,u8475,SALLY,I wish I could.
189086,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615961,u8470,LOTHER,Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that I suppose?
189087,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615960,u8475,SALLY,Why don't you leave me alone?
189088,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615959,u8470,LOTHER,It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
189089,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615958,u8475,SALLY,I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
189090,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615957,u8470,LOTHER,You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
189091,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615956,u8475,SALLY,All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
189092,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616478,u8472,MCKINNEY,This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
189095,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616473,u8472,MCKINNEY,Why?
189097,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616471,u8472,MCKINNEY,S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
189099,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616469,u8472,MCKINNEY,You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
189101,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616529,u8475,SALLY,He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
189102,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616528,u8472,MCKINNEY,Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
189103,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616519,u8472,MCKINNEY,I hope so. Well I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
189104,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616518,u8475,SALLY,I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet Inspector.
189105,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616517,u8472,MCKINNEY,Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
189106,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616462,u8472,MCKINNEY,For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless in your case there's plenty of it.
189107,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616461,u8475,SALLY,Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
189108,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616460,u8472,MCKINNEY,I sincerely hope so--
189109,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616459,u8475,SALLY,That's the truth--every single word!
189110,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616361,u8472,MCKINNEY,Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
189111,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616360,u8475,SALLY,Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
189112,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616359,u8472,MCKINNEY,And if you liked the person you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight wouldn't you?
189113,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616358,u8475,SALLY,Well of course I wouldn't take it.
189114,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616357,u8472,MCKINNEY,I mean if you knew it were stolen.
189115,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616355,u8472,MCKINNEY,He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
189116,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616354,u8475,SALLY,Exciting wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
189117,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616353,u8472,MCKINNEY,Congratulations.
189118,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616233,u8472,MCKINNEY,Good night!
189119,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616232,u8475,SALLY,It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me I think I'll go to bed. Good night Mr. McKinney!
189120,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616258,u8472,MCKINNEY,Nothin--  --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
189122,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616256,u8472,MCKINNEY,Well I'll be a son of a sea cook!
189123,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616255,u8472,MCKINNEY,It all depends on what you're used to.
189127,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615863,u8472,MCKINNEY,Thank you.
189130,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616139,u8475,SALLY,I'll explain later--
189132,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616137,u8475,SALLY,I was in his cabin--
189134,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616135,u8475,SALLY,I'm all right.
189135,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615941,u8475,SALLY,Aren't the roses beautiful?
189137,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615939,u8475,SALLY,Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
189138,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615397,u8475,SALLY,Do you think Lother could have seen it?
189140,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616330,u8476,SHORTIE,Because you ran after me.
189142,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616328,u8476,SHORTIE,Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
189144,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616326,u8476,SHORTIE,I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
189146,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616316,u8476,SHORTIE,Ain't got time.
189148,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L616314,u8476,SHORTIE,Nothin'.
189150,m575,transatlantic merry-go-round,L615563,u8476,SHORTIE,Telegrams.
195288,m595,very bad things,L640983,u8768,ADAM,We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
195291,m595,very bad things,L640716,u8768,ADAM,Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops you explain it was an accident...
195293,m595,very bad things,L640642,u8768,ADAM,Don't touch her. Call 911.
195295,m595,very bad things,L640632,u8768,ADAM,I need a drink.
195297,m595,very bad things,L640619,u8768,ADAM,Excellent.
195300,m595,very bad things,L640937,u8768,ADAM,I didn't hear you.
195302,m595,very bad things,L640935,u8768,ADAM,What did you say?
195304,m595,very bad things,L640933,u8768,ADAM,What?
195306,m595,very bad things,L641029,u8776,MICHEAL,You go home!
195307,m595,very bad things,L641028,u8768,ADAM,Go home!
195308,m595,very bad things,L641027,u8776,MICHEAL,Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
195309,m595,very bad things,L641026,u8768,ADAM,Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
195310,m595,very bad things,L641019,u8768,ADAM,You fucking bastard!
195311,m595,very bad things,L641018,u8776,MICHEAL,You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
195312,m595,very bad things,L641007,u8776,MICHEAL,You're a loser.
195313,m595,very bad things,L641006,u8768,ADAM,If you ever touch my minivan again I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
195314,m595,very bad things,L641004,u8776,MICHEAL,Eat my ass!
195315,m595,very bad things,L641003,u8768,ADAM,And you're a little fucking reject.
195316,m595,very bad things,L641002,u8776,MICHEAL,About anybody but yourself. You never have.
195317,m595,very bad things,L640899,u8776,MICHEAL,They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
195318,m595,very bad things,L640898,u8768,ADAM,Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
195319,m595,very bad things,L640828,u8768,ADAM,What are you fucking talking about?
195320,m595,very bad things,L640827,u8776,MICHEAL,You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
195321,m595,very bad things,L640826,u8768,ADAM,The hell I don't.
195322,m595,very bad things,L640825,u8776,MICHEAL,The hell you do.
195323,m595,very bad things,L640824,u8768,ADAM,I have plenty of friends.
195324,m595,very bad things,L640823,u8776,MICHEAL,You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
195325,m595,very bad things,L640822,u8768,ADAM,Don't point at me.
195326,m595,very bad things,L640821,u8776,MICHEAL,You're not a team player.
195327,m595,very bad things,L640820,u8768,ADAM,What did you say?
195328,m595,very bad things,L640819,u8776,MICHEAL,You're pathetic.
195329,m595,very bad things,L640818,u8768,ADAM,This is pathetic.
195330,m595,very bad things,L640789,u8768,ADAM,It's sacrilegious.
195331,m595,very bad things,L640788,u8776,MICHEAL,Why?
195332,m595,very bad things,L640684,u8768,ADAM,Why?!
195333,m595,very bad things,L640683,u8776,MICHEAL,I don't know why the floor was wet!
195334,m595,very bad things,L640682,u8768,ADAM,Why was the floor wet?
195335,m595,very bad things,L640681,u8776,MICHEAL,The floor was wet. She slipped!
195336,m595,very bad things,L640654,u8768,ADAM,Playing?
195337,m595,very bad things,L640653,u8776,MICHEAL,We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
195338,m595,very bad things,L640644,u8768,ADAM,She's dead.
195339,m595,very bad things,L640643,u8776,MICHEAL,I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
195340,m595,very bad things,L640559,u8776,MICHEAL,Franco mother-fucking Harris!
195341,m595,very bad things,L640558,u8768,ADAM,Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan Joe Namath JFK Paton Lombardi Hemingway...
195342,m595,very bad things,L640517,u8768,ADAM,I don't have to...
195343,m595,very bad things,L640516,u8776,MICHEAL,Name one.
195344,m595,very bad things,L640515,u8768,ADAM,Multiple reasons.
195345,m595,very bad things,L640514,u8776,MICHEAL,Oh and why am I an asshole?
195346,m595,very bad things,L640513,u8768,ADAM,You're an asshole.
195347,m595,very bad things,L640512,u8776,MICHEAL,You're an asshole Adam.
195348,m595,very bad things,L640504,u8776,MICHEAL,Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
195349,m595,very bad things,L640503,u8768,ADAM,No because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
195350,m595,very bad things,L640502,u8776,MICHEAL,Because my opinion threatens yours it's poorly developed?
195351,m595,very bad things,L640501,u8768,ADAM,It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
195352,m595,very bad things,L640452,u8768,ADAM,Sorry Fish.
195353,m595,very bad things,L640451,u8776,MICHEAL,You're interrupting a personal conversation.
195354,m595,very bad things,L640450,u8768,ADAM,No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
195355,m595,very bad things,L640449,u8776,MICHEAL,First of all...
195356,m595,very bad things,L640448,u8768,ADAM,We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come get your numbers in order by then.
195357,m595,very bad things,L641034,u8768,ADAM,No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
195358,m595,very bad things,L641033,u8770,BOYD,All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
195359,m595,very bad things,L641017,u8768,ADAM,I got children. I've got a life.
195360,m595,very bad things,L641016,u8770,BOYD,They won't figure it out.
195361,m595,very bad things,L641015,u8768,ADAM,I'm talking about DNA samples fiber optics search parties they got infrared scanners FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
195362,m595,very bad things,L641014,u8770,BOYD,It has worked.
195363,m595,very bad things,L641013,u8768,ADAM,I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
195364,m595,very bad things,L641012,u8770,BOYD,Adam! Calm down.
195365,m595,very bad things,L641011,u8768,ADAM,I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
195366,m595,very bad things,L641001,u8768,ADAM,I don't give a damn.
195367,m595,very bad things,L641000,u8770,BOYD,You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
195368,m595,very bad things,L640988,u8770,BOYD,Nobody's smoking anybody out.
195369,m595,very bad things,L640987,u8768,ADAM,They're on me. They're smoking me out!
195370,m595,very bad things,L640986,u8770,BOYD,Who? What are you talking about?
195371,m595,very bad things,L640985,u8768,ADAM,At the seven-eleven.
195372,m595,very bad things,L640984,u8770,BOYD,What?
195373,m595,very bad things,L640981,u8768,ADAM,I can't do this.
195374,m595,very bad things,L640980,u8770,BOYD,What is your problem?
195375,m595,very bad things,L640912,u8770,BOYD,Any time fat boy!
195376,m595,very bad things,L640911,u8768,ADAM,Fuck you Boyd!
195377,m595,very bad things,L640910,u8770,BOYD,Watch the tone fella.
195378,m595,very bad things,L640909,u8768,ADAM,Don't talk to me about character.
195379,m595,very bad things,L640908,u8770,BOYD,Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
195380,m595,very bad things,L640907,u8768,ADAM,Would you shush?! These phones aren't secure!
195381,m595,very bad things,L640906,u8770,BOYD,Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
195382,m595,very bad things,L640905,u8768,ADAM,You got us into this mess.
195383,m595,very bad things,L640904,u8770,BOYD,What does that mean?
195384,m595,very bad things,L640903,u8768,ADAM,Boyd you idiot the shit's coming down!
195385,m595,very bad things,L640807,u8770,BOYD,Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances and given the fact that we are alive and they are not we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here not less.
195386,m595,very bad things,L640806,u8768,ADAM,We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison whichever comes first.
195387,m595,very bad things,L640805,u8770,BOYD,Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was given the circumstances the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
195388,m595,very bad things,L640802,u8770,BOYD,Alright. Let's do it.
195389,m595,very bad things,L640801,u8768,ADAM,I am not flexible on this.
195390,m595,very bad things,L640800,u8770,BOYD,We have to get going.
195391,m595,very bad things,L640797,u8768,ADAM,Open the suitcases unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
195392,m595,very bad things,L640796,u8770,BOYD,Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
195393,m595,very bad things,L640795,u8768,ADAM,That is absolutely not true.
195394,m595,very bad things,L640794,u8770,BOYD,She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
195395,m595,very bad things,L640793,u8768,ADAM,No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
195396,m595,very bad things,L640792,u8770,BOYD,So that's what we're doing.
195397,m595,very bad things,L640791,u8768,ADAM,According to Jewish law the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
195398,m595,very bad things,L640790,u8770,BOYD,How do you figure?
195399,m595,very bad things,L640787,u8768,ADAM,No I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
195400,m595,very bad things,L640786,u8770,BOYD,We've already done this.
195401,m595,very bad things,L640785,u8768,ADAM,We can't do this.
195402,m595,very bad things,L640784,u8770,BOYD,What?
195403,m595,very bad things,L640783,u8768,ADAM,Wait. Wait a minute.
195404,m595,very bad things,L640782,u8768,ADAM,I'm not wrecking the transmission!
195405,m595,very bad things,L640781,u8770,BOYD,Sun rises at 5:52.
195406,m595,very bad things,L640738,u8770,BOYD,The reality is you take away the horror of this situation take away the tragedy of the death take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned beaten into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this.
195407,m595,very bad things,L640737,u8768,ADAM,Have you ever done this before?
195408,m595,very bad things,L640736,u8770,BOYD,Someone goes to Walmart gets some buckets brushes mops Spic and Span the works.
195409,m595,very bad things,L640735,u8768,ADAM,What about the blood?
195410,m595,very bad things,L640734,u8770,BOYD,We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
195411,m595,very bad things,L640733,u8768,ADAM,You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
195412,m595,very bad things,L640732,u8770,BOYD,Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel throw her off the balcony put her in the car...Done.

195417,m595,very bad things,L640711,u8768,ADAM,Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
195418,m595,very bad things,L640708,u8770,BOYD,Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
195419,m595,very bad things,L640707,u8768,ADAM,Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow without anybody seeing so what you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
195420,m595,very bad things,L640706,u8770,BOYD,We can do this. We can get her out of here.

195478,m595,very bad things,L640851,u8771,FISHER,I don't think so.
195479,m595,very bad things,L640850,u8768,ADAM,You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
195480,m595,very bad things,L640849,u8771,FISHER,What.

The little trees the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
195487,m595,very bad things,L640616,u8771,FISHER,I know...

And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?
195496,m595,very bad things,L640591,u8771,FISHER,No. I think it's fucked.
195497,m595,very bad things,L640590,u8768,ADAM,Are you solid with that?
195498,m595,very bad things,L640589,u8771,FISHER,Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said first of all I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
195499,m595,very bad things,L640588,u8768,ADAM,No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said Adam he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.

195528,m595,very bad things,L641119,u8770,BOYD,What are you talking about?
195530,m595,very bad things,L640765,u8770,BOYD,She's in there!

195558,m595,very bad things,L641080,u8770,BOYD,I'm not talking to you?
195561,m595,very bad things,L640856,u8770,BOYD,The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
195563,m595,very bad things,L640803,u8770,BOYD,I got her arm.
195564,m595,very bad things,L640704,u8770,BOYD,We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
195567,m595,very bad things,L640649,u8770,BOYD,Where do you look? What side of the neck?
195568,m595,very bad things,L640561,u8770,BOYD,Jack Kerouback Herman Melville Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise let me be heard...
195571,m595,very bad things,L640556,u8770,BOYD,But not tonight.
195572,m595,very bad things,L640547,u8770,BOYD,Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
195574,m595,very bad things,L640538,u8770,BOYD,That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do they do big.
195576,m595,very bad things,L640528,u8770,BOYD,Fish?
195578,m595,very bad things,L641286,u8771,FISHER,You need help.
195579,m595,very bad things,L641285,u8770,BOYD,I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain in stormy gale force wind tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
195580,m595,very bad things,L641284,u8771,FISHER,Not a prayer.
195581,m595,very bad things,L641283,u8770,BOYD,And if you think you can fuck me don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
195582,m595,very bad things,L641282,u8771,FISHER,You're sick.
195583,m595,very bad things,L641281,u8770,BOYD,Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
195584,m595,very bad things,L641278,u8770,BOYD,I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
195585,m595,very bad things,L641277,u8771,FISHER,I'm serious.
195586,m595,very bad things,L641276,u8770,BOYD,Whatever you say Kojak.
195587,m595,very bad things,L641275,u8771,FISHER,Fine? Fine what?
195588,m595,very bad things,L641274,u8770,BOYD,Okay fine.
195589,m595,very bad things,L641273,u8771,FISHER,I'm talking about some bad bad very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
195590,m595,very bad things,L641272,u8770,BOYD,You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
195591,m595,very bad things,L641271,u8771,FISHER,You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
195592,m595,very bad things,L641270,u8770,BOYD,My what?
195593,m595,very bad things,L641269,u8771,FISHER,I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
195594,m595,very bad things,L641268,u8770,BOYD,This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
195595,m595,very bad things,L641197,u8770,BOYD,Hold on a sec.  Lois you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
195596,m595,very bad things,L641196,u8771,FISHER,Isn't it a little late?
195597,m595,very bad things,L641195,u8770,BOYD,That's right.
195598,m595,very bad things,L641194,u8771,FISHER,Now?
195599,m595,very bad things,L641193,u8770,BOYD,That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
195600,m595,very bad things,L641192,u8771,FISHER,Hear what?
195601,m595,very bad things,L641191,u8770,BOYD,Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
195602,m595,very bad things,L641190,u8771,FISHER,Yeah.
195603,m595,very bad things,L641189,u8770,BOYD,I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
195604,m595,very bad things,L641188,u8771,FISHER,What does that mean?
195605,m595,very bad things,L641187,u8770,BOYD,Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
195606,m595,very bad things,L641153,u8770,BOYD,You got a nasty side to your thought process.
195607,m595,very bad things,L641152,u8771,FISHER,I don't know...
195608,m595,very bad things,L641151,u8770,BOYD,And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
195609,m595,very bad things,L641150,u8771,FISHER,What does that mean?
195610,m595,very bad things,L641149,u8770,BOYD,Take care of business.
195611,m595,very bad things,L641148,u8771,FISHER,What are you going to do?
195612,m595,very bad things,L641147,u8770,BOYD,Just do it.
195613,m595,very bad things,L641146,u8771,FISHER,I don't think that's such a good idea.
195614,m595,very bad things,L641145,u8770,BOYD,After you drop the kids off take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
195615,m595,very bad things,L641117,u8770,BOYD,Suck my ass.
195616,m595,very bad things,L641116,u8771,FISHER,Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
195617,m595,very bad things,L641100,u8771,FISHER,No but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
195618,m595,very bad things,L641099,u8770,BOYD,Does she sound pissed scared hostile? Did she mention the police?
195619,m595,very bad things,L641098,u8771,FISHER,Regarding what?
195620,m595,very bad things,L641082,u8770,BOYD,You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
195621,m595,very bad things,L641081,u8771,FISHER,What's your point?
195622,m595,very bad things,L641078,u8770,BOYD,Exactly! Exactly my point.
195623,m595,very bad things,L641077,u8771,FISHER,I just want to get married.
195624,m595,very bad things,L641076,u8770,BOYD,What you just said. Say it again.
195625,m595,very bad things,L641075,u8771,FISHER,What?
195626,m595,very bad things,L641074,u8770,BOYD,Say it again.
195627,m595,very bad things,L641073,u8771,FISHER,I don't know! I just want to get married.
195628,m595,very bad things,L641072,u8770,BOYD,Yes you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
195629,m595,very bad things,L641071,u8771,FISHER,I said what have we done?
195630,m595,very bad things,L641070,u8770,BOYD,What is the question you asked me?
195631,m595,very bad things,L641069,u8771,FISHER,What?
195632,m595,very bad things,L641068,u8770,BOYD,What did you ask me?
195633,m595,very bad things,L641067,u8771,FISHER,Boyd...What have we done?
195634,m595,very bad things,L641066,u8770,BOYD,He is not cracking up.
195635,m595,very bad things,L641065,u8771,FISHER,He's cracked up.
195636,m595,very bad things,L641047,u8770,BOYD,No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
195637,m595,very bad things,L641046,u8771,FISHER,Easy Boyd.
195638,m595,very bad things,L640977,u8771,FISHER,He's having a problem here.
195639,m595,very bad things,L640976,u8770,BOYD,Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
195640,m595,very bad things,L640975,u8771,FISHER,Shut up Boyd.
195641,m595,very bad things,L640974,u8770,BOYD,OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
195642,m595,very bad things,L640972,u8771,FISHER,No the problem as I recall was the lack of blocking...
195643,m595,very bad things,L640971,u8770,BOYD,The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
195644,m595,very bad things,L640968,u8771,FISHER,You always were a jealous man.
195645,m595,very bad things,L640967,u8770,BOYD,Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
195646,m595,very bad things,L640861,u8770,BOYD,However it goes the point is nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
195647,m595,very bad things,L640830,u8770,BOYD,No this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I as well as several others present have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed living in major denial locked down fly-boy butt-fucker.
195648,m595,very bad things,L640829,u8771,FISHER,Micheal now is probably not the best time for this.
195649,m595,very bad things,L640814,u8770,BOYD,Go ahead.
195650,m595,very bad things,L640813,u8771,FISHER,I'm talking about prayer.
195651,m595,very bad things,L640812,u8770,BOYD,What kind of words?
195652,m595,very bad things,L640811,u8771,FISHER,I think we should say some words over the grave.
195653,m595,very bad things,L640810,u8770,BOYD,That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly yes but to give him credit for this for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
195654,m595,very bad things,L640774,u8770,BOYD,So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
195655,m595,very bad things,L640773,u8771,FISHER,I'm calling the police.
195656,m595,very bad things,L640772,u8770,BOYD,All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
195657,m595,very bad things,L640730,u8771,FISHER,Good God...Good God...
195658,m595,very bad things,L640729,u8770,BOYD,Nobody knows she's here.
195659,m595,very bad things,L640714,u8770,BOYD,What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
195660,m595,very bad things,L640713,u8771,FISHER,Oh God. This is insane.
195661,m595,very bad things,L640710,u8770,BOYD,Nobody knows.
195662,m595,very bad things,L640709,u8771,FISHER,Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
195663,m595,very bad things,L640692,u8770,BOYD,Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say ah...our friend Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he ah sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
195664,m595,very bad things,L640691,u8771,FISHER,Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
195665,m595,very bad things,L640671,u8770,BOYD,Shut up.
195666,m595,very bad things,L640670,u8771,FISHER,Call 911.
195667,m595,very bad things,L640669,u8770,BOYD,Shut up.
195668,m595,very bad things,L640668,u8771,FISHER,She's dead. Call somebody!
195669,m595,very bad things,L640667,u8770,BOYD,No.
195670,m595,very bad things,L640666,u8771,FISHER,Oh Jesus...call the police.
195671,m595,very bad things,L640624,u8771,FISHER,I can't.
195672,m595,very bad things,L640623,u8770,BOYD,She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
195673,m595,very bad things,L640534,u8770,BOYD,Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38 or in plain English...
195674,m595,very bad things,L640533,u8771,FISHER,We need padded chairs.
195675,m595,very bad things,L640532,u8770,BOYD,That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
195676,m595,very bad things,L640531,u8771,FISHER,No I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
195677,m595,very bad things,L640530,u8770,BOYD,Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
195678,m595,very bad things,L640529,u8771,FISHER,Not really.  Yes the Fisher wedding chairs...
195679,m595,very bad things,L640522,u8770,BOYD,Who's up for making some real money?
195680,m595,very bad things,L640521,u8771,FISHER,Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah I'll hold.
195681,m595,very bad things,L640511,u8770,BOYD,Well I didn't mean it.
195682,m595,very bad things,L640510,u8771,FISHER,You said that Boyd.
195683,m595,very bad things,L641202,u8776,MICHEAL,I love you.
195684,m595,very bad things,L641201,u8770,BOYD,Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
195685,m595,very bad things,L641200,u8776,MICHEAL,How about my Fatburger?
195686,m595,very bad things,L641199,u8770,BOYD,Okay Micheal let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
195687,m595,very bad things,L641112,u8770,BOYD,Give me the Valium.
195688,m595,very bad things,L641111,u8776,MICHEAL,Goosed!
195689,m595,very bad things,L641110,u8770,BOYD,Stop.
195690,m595,very bad things,L641109,u8776,MICHEAL,Goosed!
195691,m595,very bad things,L641108,u8770,BOYD,Stop it!
195692,m595,very bad things,L641102,u8770,BOYD,Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
195693,m595,very bad things,L641101,u8776,MICHEAL,We're goosed! Goosed by God!
195694,m595,very bad things,L641095,u8770,BOYD,We're not goosed.
195695,m595,very bad things,L641094,u8776,MICHEAL,We're goosed.
195696,m595,very bad things,L641055,u8776,MICHEAL,He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
195697,m595,very bad things,L641054,u8770,BOYD,Easy Micheal.
195698,m595,very bad things,L640870,u8773,LIZ,Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.
195699,m595,very bad things,L640869,u8771,FISHER,I'm working on it.
195700,m595,very bad things,L640868,u8773,LIZ,What's the word on the chairs?
195701,m595,very bad things,L640846,u8771,FISHER,No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
195702,m595,very bad things,L640845,u8773,LIZ,You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
195703,m595,very bad things,L640844,u8771,FISHER,I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
195704,m595,very bad things,L640843,u8773,LIZ,The chairs.
195705,m595,very bad things,L640842,u8771,FISHER,What!
195706,m595,very bad things,L640841,u8773,LIZ,What okay?
195707,m595,very bad things,L640840,u8771,FISHER,Okay.
195708,m595,very bad things,L640839,u8773,LIZ,What about the chairs?
195709,m595,very bad things,L640838,u8771,FISHER,No. Just like an hour or so.
195710,m595,very bad things,L640837,u8773,LIZ,How late?
195711,m595,very bad things,L640836,u8771,FISHER,We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
195712,m595,very bad things,L640835,u8773,LIZ,Where are you?
195713,m595,very bad things,L640834,u8771,FISHER,Hey. It's me.
195714,m595,very bad things,L640833,u8773,LIZ,Hello.
195715,m595,very bad things,L640578,u8771,FISHER,I'll see you tomorrow...
195716,m595,very bad things,L640577,u8773,LIZ,Go have fun. Not too much.
195717,m595,very bad things,L640576,u8771,FISHER,I'm mad at you.
195718,m595,very bad things,L640575,u8773,LIZ,Yeah. Nesting.
195719,m595,very bad things,L640574,u8771,FISHER,Nesting?
195720,m595,very bad things,L640573,u8773,LIZ,Just a bit of organizing.
195721,m595,very bad things,L640572,u8771,FISHER,What are you doing?
195722,m595,very bad things,L640571,u8773,LIZ,Well you should.
195723,m595,very bad things,L640570,u8771,FISHER,Well I do.
195724,m595,very bad things,L640569,u8773,LIZ,That's sweet.
195725,m595,very bad things,L640568,u8771,FISHER,I'm working on it I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
195726,m595,very bad things,L640567,u8773,LIZ,Well the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
195727,m595,very bad things,L640566,u8771,FISHER,Not yet.
195728,m595,very bad things,L640565,u8773,LIZ,Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
195729,m595,very bad things,L640564,u8771,FISHER,Hi.

195734,m595,very bad things,L640494,u8771,FISHER,Of course.
195735,m595,very bad things,L640493,u8773,LIZ,Do you love me?
195736,m595,very bad things,L640492,u8771,FISHER,I will.
195737,m595,very bad things,L640491,u8773,LIZ,Will you please call the chair people?
195738,m595,very bad things,L640481,u8773,LIZ,Maybe.
195739,m595,very bad things,L640480,u8771,FISHER,We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
195740,m595,very bad things,L640479,u8773,LIZ,Take care of those chairs.
195741,m595,very bad things,L640478,u8771,FISHER,More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
195742,m595,very bad things,L640477,u8773,LIZ,Do you love me?
195743,m595,very bad things,L640476,u8771,FISHER,I'll call them from the road.
195744,m595,very bad things,L640475,u8773,LIZ,I need your help.
195745,m595,very bad things,L640474,u8771,FISHER,We're leaving in three hours.
195746,m595,very bad things,L640473,u8773,LIZ,I need your help.
195747,m595,very bad things,L640472,u8771,FISHER,Honey I don't have the time...
195748,m595,very bad things,L640471,u8773,LIZ,Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
195749,m595,very bad things,L640470,u8771,FISHER,Go down where?
195750,m595,very bad things,L640469,u8773,LIZ,You go down there.
195751,m595,very bad things,L640468,u8771,FISHER,So what do we do?
195752,m595,very bad things,L640467,u8773,LIZ,Not padded ones.
195753,m595,very bad things,L640466,u8771,FISHER,What kind of seats can we have?
195754,m595,very bad things,L640465,u8773,LIZ,We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
195755,m595,very bad things,L640464,u8771,FISHER,I'm not. What's the problem?
195756,m595,very bad things,L640463,u8773,LIZ,Keith do not trivialize this.
195757,m595,very bad things,L640462,u8771,FISHER,Okay.
195758,m595,very bad things,L640461,u8773,LIZ,Seating problems.
195759,m595,very bad things,L640460,u8771,FISHER,Problems?
195760,m595,very bad things,L640459,u8773,LIZ,We've got problems here.
195761,m595,very bad things,L640435,u8773,LIZ,Kiss me...?
195762,m595,very bad things,L640434,u8771,FISHER,With all my heart.
195763,m595,very bad things,L640433,u8773,LIZ,How much?
195764,m595,very bad things,L640432,u8771,FISHER,Of course.
195765,m595,very bad things,L640431,u8773,LIZ,Do you love me?
195766,m595,very bad things,L640429,u8771,FISHER,You will not be common!!!
195767,m595,very bad things,L640428,u8773,LIZ,I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
195768,m595,very bad things,L640427,u8771,FISHER,I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
195769,m595,very bad things,L640426,u8773,LIZ,I've seen it on television.
195770,m595,very bad things,L640425,u8771,FISHER,That's absurd.
195771,m595,very bad things,L640424,u8773,LIZ,It's vile!
195772,m595,very bad things,L640423,u8771,FISHER,Time out.
195773,m595,very bad things,L640421,u8771,FISHER,You expect more what?
195774,m595,very bad things,L640420,u8773,LIZ,He's weird. And I expect more from you.
195775,m595,very bad things,L640419,u8771,FISHER,He's a great chef.
195776,m595,very bad things,L640418,u8773,LIZ,Why? What's his problem?
195777,m595,very bad things,L640417,u8771,FISHER,He just doesn't talk a lot.
195778,m595,very bad things,L640416,u8773,LIZ,He's weird.
195779,m595,very bad things,L640415,u8771,FISHER,He's quiet.
195780,m595,very bad things,L640414,u8773,LIZ,He's weird.
195781,m595,very bad things,L640413,u8771,FISHER,I've known him since Cub Scouts.
195782,m595,very bad things,L640412,u8773,LIZ,I just don't see him in the big picture.
195783,m595,very bad things,L640411,u8771,FISHER,What does Moore have to do with your growing?
195784,m595,very bad things,L640410,u8773,LIZ,It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
195785,m595,very bad things,L640409,u8771,FISHER,You don't like Moore? Since when?
195786,m595,very bad things,L640408,u8773,LIZ,Charles Moore for instants.
195787,m595,very bad things,L640407,u8771,FISHER,Who else?
195788,m595,very bad things,L640406,u8773,LIZ,I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
195789,m595,very bad things,L640405,u8771,FISHER,I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
195790,m595,very bad things,L640404,u8773,LIZ,I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up assuming responsibility of yourself.
195791,m595,very bad things,L640403,u8771,FISHER,What are you talking about?
195792,m595,very bad things,L640402,u8773,LIZ,Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
195793,m595,very bad things,L640396,u8773,LIZ,David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
195794,m595,very bad things,L640395,u8771,FISHER,He's my friend. He's not a moron.
195795,m595,very bad things,L640394,u8773,LIZ,He's a moron.
195796,m595,very bad things,L640393,u8771,FISHER,He is.
195797,m595,very bad things,L640392,u8773,LIZ,I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
195798,m595,very bad things,L640391,u8771,FISHER,It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
195799,m595,very bad things,L640390,u8773,LIZ,Right before the wedding?
195800,m595,very bad things,L640389,u8771,FISHER,How do you figure?
195801,m595,very bad things,L640388,u8773,LIZ,Well it's bad timing.
195802,m595,very bad things,L640387,u8771,FISHER,They organized this not me. I have nothing to do with it.
195803,m595,very bad things,L640386,u8773,LIZ,It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
195804,m595,very bad things,L640385,u8771,FISHER,I wouldn't know.
195805,m595,very bad things,L640384,u8773,LIZ,I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
195806,m595,very bad things,L640383,u8771,FISHER,Are we going to do this again?
195807,m595,very bad things,L640382,u8773,LIZ,I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
195808,m595,very bad things,L640381,u8771,FISHER,I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
195809,m595,very bad things,L640380,u8773,LIZ,You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
195810,m595,very bad things,L640379,u8771,FISHER,Stop it. I'm sorry.
195811,m595,very bad things,L640378,u8773,LIZ,Don't you put this on me. Don't do it don't do it don't do it don't...
195812,m595,very bad things,L640377,u8771,FISHER,What?
195813,m595,very bad things,L640376,u8773,LIZ,Don't you dare.
195814,m595,very bad things,L640375,u8771,FISHER,Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
195815,m595,very bad things,L640374,u8773,LIZ,I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
195816,m595,very bad things,L640373,u8771,FISHER,How could I know what else I forgot?
195817,m595,very bad things,L640372,u8773,LIZ,What else have you forgot?
195818,m595,very bad things,L640371,u8771,FISHER,I'm not playing around. I forgot.
195819,m595,very bad things,L640370,u8773,LIZ,You can't play around with these tent people.
195820,m595,very bad things,L640369,u8771,FISHER,I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
195821,m595,very bad things,L640368,u8773,LIZ,Why did you forget the tent check?
195822,m595,very bad things,L640367,u8771,FISHER,Why what?
195823,m595,very bad things,L640366,u8773,LIZ,Why?
195824,m595,very bad things,L640365,u8771,FISHER,I think so.
195825,m595,very bad things,L640364,u8773,LIZ,You forgot the tent?
195826,m595,very bad things,L640363,u8771,FISHER,I think I forgot the tent.
195827,m595,very bad things,L640362,u8773,LIZ,Hotel for my parents the tent the band the Judge...

195836,m595,very bad things,L640353,u8771,FISHER,I sent a lot of checks I'm not sure what all of them are.
195837,m595,very bad things,L640352,u8773,LIZ,What do you mean you think so?
195838,m595,very bad things,L640351,u8771,FISHER,I think so.

195840,m595,very bad things,L640349,u8771,FISHER,I'm not sure.
195841,m595,very bad things,L640348,u8773,LIZ,Why is this Kid staring at me?
195842,m595,very bad things,L640347,u8771,FISHER,I don't think so.
195843,m595,very bad things,L640346,u8773,LIZ,Can't we do it on the phone?
195844,m595,very bad things,L640345,u8771,FISHER,We missed the deadline.
195845,m595,very bad things,L640344,u8773,LIZ,Why can't we do it through the mail?
195846,m595,very bad things,L640343,u8771,FISHER,Government cutbacks.
195847,m595,very bad things,L640342,u8773,LIZ,This is ridiculous.

195859,m595,very bad things,L641185,u8776,MICHEAL,Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right.
195860,m595,very bad things,L641184,u8771,FISHER,What is it?
195861,m595,very bad things,L641183,u8776,MICHEAL,If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...

195864,m595,very bad things,L641176,u8776,MICHEAL,I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.
195865,m595,very bad things,L641175,u8771,FISHER,I think so.
195866,m595,very bad things,L641174,u8776,MICHEAL,That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together just right you know just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
195867,m595,very bad things,L641173,u8771,FISHER,The wahoo moment?
195868,m595,very bad things,L641172,u8776,MICHEAL,The sparkler would burn hot then hotter then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
195869,m595,very bad things,L641171,u8771,FISHER,The wahoo?

195887,m595,very bad things,L640455,u8776,MICHEAL,I don't care for him.
195888,m595,very bad things,L640447,u8771,FISHER,Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded dizzy and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
195889,m595,very bad things,L640446,u8776,MICHEAL,You're not breathing right?
195890,m595,very bad things,L640445,u8771,FISHER,I'm not breathing right.

Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343.  Same shower towel toothbrush razor hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body.
195892,m595,very bad things,L640443,u8771,FISHER,I just want her to be happy.
195893,m595,very bad things,L640442,u8776,MICHEAL,Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
195894,m595,very bad things,L640441,u8771,FISHER,About what?
195895,m595,very bad things,L640440,u8776,MICHEAL,It means she's insecure.
195896,m595,very bad things,L640439,u8771,FISHER,What does that mean?
195897,m595,very bad things,L640438,u8776,MICHEAL,Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
195898,m595,very bad things,L640437,u8771,FISHER,I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
195899,m595,very bad things,L640436,u8776,MICHEAL,That's just insecurity.

195918,m595,very bad things,L640877,u8773,LIZ,We don't think so. I mean we just want the singing when I come out.

198291,m606,wild things,L654813,u8909,GLORIA,I know you do.
198292,m606,wild things,L654812,u8912,KELLY,I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
198293,m606,wild things,L654811,u8909,GLORIA,How are you Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
198294,m606,wild things,L655332,u8909,GLORIA,Suzie?
198295,m606,wild things,L655331,u8916,SAM,Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
198296,m606,wild things,L655327,u8909,GLORIA,You could tell me where you were last night.
198297,m606,wild things,L655326,u8916,SAM,I don't know what to say...
198298,m606,wild things,L655325,u8909,GLORIA,Ray thinks she was murdered.
198299,m606,wild things,L655324,u8916,SAM,Maybe she used another name.
198300,m606,wild things,L655323,u8909,GLORIA,She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
198301,m606,wild things,L655322,u8916,SAM,How long?
198302,m606,wild things,L655321,u8909,GLORIA,Suzie Toller is missing.
198303,m606,wild things,L655320,u8916,SAM,Isn't that against the law peeking into windows?
198304,m606,wild things,L654920,u8916,SAM,There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday in the office.
198305,m606,wild things,L654919,u8909,GLORIA,Weren't you a little worried about her...?
198306,m606,wild things,L654918,u8916,SAM,No.
198307,m606,wild things,L654917,u8909,GLORIA,Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
198308,m606,wild things,L654914,u8916,SAM,Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
198309,m606,wild things,L654913,u8909,GLORIA,And when you turned her toward the door where did you expect her to go without a car?
198310,m606,wild things,L654694,u8909,GLORIA,I'd like that.
198311,m606,wild things,L654693,u8916,SAM,If old pictures interest you come back some time there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
198312,m606,wild things,L655342,u8909,GLORIA,It's Homicide's job now Ray let 'em do it.  I'll tell you something else there's more to this story than you know Ray... If Suzie is dead I think Hunter may be on the right track...
198313,m606,wild things,L655341,u8914,RAY,The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
198314,m606,wild things,L655340,u8909,GLORIA,He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
198315,m606,wild things,L655339,u8914,RAY,Where's Lombardo?
198316,m606,wild things,L655338,u8909,GLORIA,I'm tired Ray.  I'm going home.
198317,m606,wild things,L655299,u8914,RAY,If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
198318,m606,wild things,L655298,u8909,GLORIA,And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
198319,m606,wild things,L655297,u8914,RAY,Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
198320,m606,wild things,L655296,u8914,RAY,What if I'm right Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
198321,m606,wild things,L655295,u8909,GLORIA,Ray you heard him...
198322,m606,wild things,L655294,u8914,RAY,Will you do me one favor?
198323,m606,wild things,L655291,u8909,GLORIA,We don't know that Ray...
198324,m606,wild things,L655290,u8914,RAY,Poor dumb Suzie she never had a chance.
198325,m606,wild things,L655286,u8914,RAY,You don't think Sam could've put it there?
198326,m606,wild things,L655285,u8909,GLORIA,Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
198327,m606,wild things,L655284,u8914,RAY,The swamp most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
198328,m606,wild things,L655283,u8909,GLORIA,Where's the body?
198329,m606,wild things,L655282,u8914,RAY,Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.

198334,m606,wild things,L655259,u8914,RAY,I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
198335,m606,wild things,L655258,u8909,GLORIA,Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
198336,m606,wild things,L655257,u8914,RAY,It's starting Gloria.  This is how it begins...
198337,m606,wild things,L655217,u8914,RAY,I mean something bad Gloria something bad you saw coning and you didn't do anything and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
198338,m606,wild things,L655216,u8909,GLORIA,We all have...
198339,m606,wild things,L655215,u8914,RAY,Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
198340,m606,wild things,L655214,u8909,GLORIA,You could say that.
198341,m606,wild things,L655213,u8914,RAY,Guess I kind of lost it there.
198342,m606,wild things,L655206,u8914,RAY,What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
198343,m606,wild things,L655205,u8909,GLORIA,Which she might have saved if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
198344,m606,wild things,L655126,u8914,RAY,I net a guy in a bar.
198345,m606,wild things,L655125,u8909,GLORIA,Where'd you come up with this stuff anyway?
198346,m606,wild things,L655124,u8914,RAY,You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
198347,m606,wild things,L655123,u8909,GLORIA,Eliminate the competition.
198348,m606,wild things,L655122,u8914,RAY,I flat don't like the guy Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land got investors like Lombardo to put up money then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve on the sly of course but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast right where Van Ryan wanted it.
198349,m606,wild things,L655121,u8909,GLORIA,This one's got you working overtime hasn't it?
198350,m606,wild things,L655120,u8914,RAY,Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
198351,m606,wild things,L655119,u8909,GLORIA,So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
198352,m606,wild things,L655117,u8914,RAY,The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
198353,m606,wild things,L655116,u8909,GLORIA,Why?  You ask me Lombardo had it pretty good already nice job in a beautiful setting popular an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
198354,m606,wild things,L655115,u8914,RAY,They chumped us Gloria right from the start.
198355,m606,wild things,L655114,u8914,RAY,Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
198356,m606,wild things,L655113,u8909,GLORIA,Unless what?
198357,m606,wild things,L655112,u8914,RAY,I thought of that.  Then I said come on you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
198358,m606,wild things,L655111,u8909,GLORIA,Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
198359,m606,wild things,L655110,u8914,RAY,Think back before the suit was filed before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
198360,m606,wild things,L655107,u8909,GLORIA,Lombardo's settlement?
198361,m606,wild things,L655106,u8914,RAY,You saw the news today?
198362,m606,wild things,L654954,u8914,RAY,It's a shithole.  But she was dirty what was I gonna do?
198363,m606,wild things,L654953,u8909,GLORIA,That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
198364,m606,wild things,L654952,u8909,GLORIA,You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
198365,m606,wild things,L654951,u8914,RAY,This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
198366,m606,wild things,L654950,u8909,GLORIA,The skinny brunette.
198367,m606,wild things,L654949,u8914,RAY,You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
198368,m606,wild things,L654947,u8914,RAY,Yeah well Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
198369,m606,wild things,L654946,u8909,GLORIA,You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
198370,m606,wild things,L654942,u8909,GLORIA,All I'm saying is we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard we're going to wind up looking stupid.
198371,m606,wild things,L654941,u8914,RAY,You're telling me you believe the guy?
198372,m606,wild things,L654940,u8909,GLORIA,We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street but that's it.  With no physical evidence what do we have?  Her word against his.
198373,m606,wild things,L654936,u8914,RAY,Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
198374,m606,wild things,L654935,u8909,GLORIA,Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
198375,m606,wild things,L654851,u8909,GLORIA,Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
198376,m606,wild things,L654850,u8914,RAY,It's our job Gloria.
198377,m606,wild things,L654845,u8909,GLORIA,All I'm saying is I think we should go slow here.
198378,m606,wild things,L654844,u8914,RAY,That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
198379,m606,wild things,L654692,u8909,GLORIA,Back to the land of grownups.
198380,m606,wild things,L654691,u8914,RAY,I've got that two o'clock in town.
198381,m606,wild things,L655002,u8909,GLORIA,What was that?
198382,m606,wild things,L655001,u8918,SUZIE,He did say something.
198383,m606,wild things,L654999,u8918,SUZIE,No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
198384,m606,wild things,L654998,u8909,GLORIA,At that point were you able to fight him off?
198385,m606,wild things,L654987,u8918,SUZIE,I guess.
198386,m606,wild things,L654986,u8909,GLORIA,Did he come in with you?
198387,m606,wild things,L654985,u8918,SUZIE,Yes.
198388,m606,wild things,L654984,u8909,GLORIA,So you were alone.
198389,m606,wild things,L654983,u8918,SUZIE,No.
198390,m606,wild things,L654982,u8909,GLORIA,And when he arrived at your house was anyone there?
198391,m606,wild things,L654981,u8918,SUZIE,Yeah.
198392,m606,wild things,L654980,u8909,GLORIA,He dropped Jimmy off first?
198393,m606,wild things,L654979,u8918,SUZIE,About a year ago.
198394,m606,wild things,L654978,u8909,GLORIA,We need to tape the interview Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
198395,m606,wild things,L654977,u8918,SUZIE,You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
198396,m606,wild things,L654974,u8909,GLORIA,Why is that?
198397,m606,wild things,L654973,u8918,SUZIE,Yeah maybe a little.
198398,m606,wild things,L654972,u8909,GLORIA,That bothers you?
198400,m606,wild things,L654847,u8909,GLORIA,You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
198402,m606,wild things,L654843,u8909,GLORIA,I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
198404,m606,wild things,L654841,u8909,GLORIA,That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
198405,m606,wild things,L654838,u8909,GLORIA,I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
198408,m606,wild things,L655361,u8914,RAY,The teeth were they...
198409,m606,wild things,L655359,u8914,RAY,She looked shaky but lucid.  I thought I would just go with her stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down but she slowed me up just enough.  Before I could get to her she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds I think. In the chest.
198411,m606,wild things,L655357,u8914,RAY,I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded like she understood.  We stood up together.
198412,m606,wild things,L655356,u8914,RAY,Bit scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
198414,m606,wild things,L655353,u8914,RAY,I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did her rights.
198416,m606,wild things,L655351,u8914,RAY,I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation the one thing they train you for... God what did I do?
198418,m606,wild things,L655292,u8914,RAY,Kelly's next Gloria.
198419,m606,wild things,L655209,u8914,RAY,You think this is just about money about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
198421,m606,wild things,L655204,u8914,RAY,I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting from the beginning.  And we bought it hook line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
198425,m606,wild things,L654933,u8914,RAY,We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard couple of kids playing hoops.
198427,m606,wild things,L654931,u8914,RAY,Not that stuff about her running away him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
198429,m606,wild things,L654839,u8914,RAY,Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
198431,m606,wild things,L655036,u8918,SUZIE,He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like you're his favorite then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this I thought cool all these big shots screwing me over like that cop Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
198433,m606,wild things,L655025,u8918,SUZIE,This wasn't my idea.
198435,m606,wild things,L655023,u8918,SUZIE,I said he did.
198437,m606,wild things,L655020,u8918,SUZIE,Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
198439,m606,wild things,L655018,u8918,SUZIE,He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
198440,m606,wild things,L654997,u8918,SUZIE,Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now can I go home?
198442,m606,wild things,L654995,u8918,SUZIE,Shit what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
198444,m606,wild things,L654991,u8918,SUZIE,I wanna go home now.
198446,m606,wild things,L654989,u8918,SUZIE,Yeah... okay... he did
198449,m606,wild things,L654710,u8916,SAM,A ride.  You want one?

198468,m606,wild things,L655233,u8912,KELLY,I think we just need to get wasted.
198469,m606,wild things,L655232,u8918,SUZIE,I thought we were goin' to a movie.
198470,m606,wild things,L655231,u8912,KELLY,Nothing.
198471,m606,wild things,L655230,u8918,SUZIE,What are you looking at?
198472,m606,wild things,L655229,u8918,SUZIE,What brain?
198473,m606,wild things,L655228,u8912,KELLY,Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
198474,m606,wild things,L655195,u8912,KELLY,Are you retarded or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
198475,m606,wild things,L655194,u8918,SUZIE,You are.
198476,m606,wild things,L655193,u8912,KELLY,Oh for Christ's sake.
198477,m606,wild things,L655192,u8918,SUZIE,You're gonna fuck me over aren't you?
198478,m606,wild things,L655174,u8912,KELLY,You can trust me.
198479,m606,wild things,L655173,u8918,SUZIE,I'm scared that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
198480,m606,wild things,L655172,u8912,KELLY,I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
198481,m606,wild things,L655145,u8918,SUZIE,Man I wanna smoke a joint.
198482,m606,wild things,L655144,u8912,KELLY,Yeah I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me Suzie this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
198483,m606,wild things,L655143,u8918,SUZIE,Yeah but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
198484,m606,wild things,L655142,u8912,KELLY,Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
198485,m606,wild things,L655253,u8914,RAY,I'm not on your property!
198486,m606,wild things,L655252,u8912,KELLY,Get off my property.
198487,m606,wild things,L655138,u8912,KELLY,Police -- God -- get a life.
198488,m606,wild things,L655137,u8914,RAY,Am I right did Sam sell you on the idea right up front of whacking Suzie? That's murder Kelly.
198489,m606,wild things,L655136,u8914,RAY,I've been a cop for a while Kelly.  It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret let alone three.  And then there's the love angle.  I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around now that you have the money?
198490,m606,wild things,L655135,u8912,KELLY,You're out of your mind.
198491,m606,wild things,L655134,u8914,RAY,The thing about it is threesomes so rarely work out.
198492,m606,wild things,L655133,u8914,RAY,You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
198493,m606,wild things,L655132,u8912,KELLY,Excuse me?
198494,m606,wild things,L655130,u8912,KELLY,About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?
198495,m606,wild things,L655129,u8914,RAY,Curiosity I guess.
198496,m606,wild things,L655128,u8912,KELLY,Is there some reason why you're here?
198497,m606,wild things,L655269,u8912,KELLY,A friend of mine bought a boat.
198499,m606,wild things,L655267,u8912,KELLY,Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
198501,m606,wild things,L655265,u8912,KELLY,You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever for me...
198502,m606,wild things,L654802,u8912,KELLY,Yes.  God Mom...
198504,m606,wild things,L654800,u8912,KELLY,I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
198507,m606,wild things,L654793,u8912,KELLY,No you don't.
198509,m606,wild things,L654791,u8912,KELLY,I miss Dad.
198511,m606,wild things,L654788,u8912,KELLY,No thanks to you.
198513,m606,wild things,L654786,u8912,KELLY,My friends buy me clothes so I don't look like trash.
198514,m606,wild things,L654785,u8912,KELLY,You notice my new jumper?
198518,m606,wild things,L654719,u8912,KELLY,Hi Mon.
198520,m606,wild things,L655455,u8912,KELLY,Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
198521,m606,wild things,L655454,u8916,SAM,You think that's wise?
198522,m606,wild things,L655453,u8912,KELLY,I'm running away.
198523,m606,wild things,L655441,u8912,KELLY,No little girl can ever make me come.
198524,m606,wild things,L655440,u8916,SAM,I love you.  Now give me the line.
198525,m606,wild things,L655439,u8912,KELLY,Say you love me.
198526,m606,wild things,L655438,u8916,SAM,That's not your line.
198527,m606,wild things,L655437,u8912,KELLY,That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
198528,m606,wild things,L655319,u8912,KELLY,Okay.  I love you too.
198529,m606,wild things,L655318,u8916,SAM,So if they're tapping your phone we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
198530,m606,wild things,L655317,u8912,KELLY,But what if they find out... God they'd put you in the gas chamber...
198531,m606,wild things,L655316,u8916,SAM,Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
198532,m606,wild things,L655315,u8912,KELLY,I don't know.  I want to see you...
198533,m606,wild things,L655314,u8916,SAM,And you believe her?
198534,m606,wild things,L655313,u8912,KELLY,I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
198535,m606,wild things,L655312,u8916,SAM,Yeah he got her busted for possession...
198536,m606,wild things,L655311,u8912,KELLY,I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
198537,m606,wild things,L655310,u8916,SAM,Duquette.  Forget him...
198538,m606,wild things,L655309,u8912,KELLY,I'm really serious.  That cop he keeps watching me.
198539,m606,wild things,L655308,u8912,KELLY,God I've been calling you.
198540,m606,wild things,L655307,u8916,SAM,Hello.
198541,m606,wild things,L655306,u8912,KELLY,Hello?
198542,m606,wild things,L655248,u8912,KELLY,There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
198543,m606,wild things,L655247,u8916,SAM,I'm sorry Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
198544,m606,wild things,L655186,u8916,SAM,Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
198545,m606,wild things,L655185,u8912,KELLY,I'm here.
198546,m606,wild things,L655181,u8916,SAM,Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay?
198547,m606,wild things,L655180,u8912,KELLY,You know what it takes.
198548,m606,wild things,L655179,u8916,SAM,No!  Christ.  Listen Kelly I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to whatever it takes...
198549,m606,wild things,L655178,u8912,KELLY,Why can't you come...
198550,m606,wild things,L655177,u8916,SAM,Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
198551,m606,wild things,L655176,u8912,KELLY,Yes.
198552,m606,wild things,L655175,u8916,SAM,Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
198553,m606,wild things,L655105,u8912,KELLY,Stick?
198554,m606,wild things,L655104,u8916,SAM,We have to stick with the plan.
198555,m606,wild things,L655103,u8912,KELLY,Do it to ourselves?
198556,m606,wild things,L655102,u8916,SAM,The only way we're gonna blow this now is if we do it ourselves...
198557,m606,wild things,L655100,u8912,KELLY,Hey come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
198558,m606,wild things,L655099,u8916,SAM,From now on if we're seen together it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
198559,m606,wild things,L655095,u8912,KELLY,Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
198560,m606,wild things,L655094,u8916,SAM,God you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
198561,m606,wild things,L655089,u8916,SAM,About six and a half million dollars.
198562,m606,wild things,L655088,u8912,KELLY,How much?
198563,m606,wild things,L655086,u8912,KELLY,So you got my mom's money.
198564,m606,wild things,L655085,u8916,SAM,Jesus Christ what are you doing?
198565,m606,wild things,L655074,u8916,SAM,Look Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.
198566,m606,wild things,L655073,u8912,KELLY,Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
198567,m606,wild things,L655072,u8916,SAM,Kelly...
198568,m606,wild things,L654754,u8912,KELLY,Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
198569,m606,wild things,L654753,u8916,SAM,All right.  I'll have to look for it.
198570,m606,wild things,L654752,u8912,KELLY,Rules are rules Mr. Lombardo.
198571,m606,wild things,L654751,u8916,SAM,Jeez that thing... Can't you...
198572,m606,wild things,L654750,u8912,KELLY,Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
198573,m606,wild things,L654749,u8916,SAM,So where you off to now?
198574,m606,wild things,L654743,u8916,SAM,In back of the garage.
198575,m606,wild things,L654742,u8912,KELLY,Where's the hose?  We can set up.
198576,m606,wild things,L654740,u8916,SAM,No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
198577,m606,wild things,L654739,u8912,KELLY,Look he forgot.  I knew it.
198578,m606,wild things,L654717,u8916,SAM,I won't.
198579,m606,wild things,L654716,u8912,KELLY,Don't forget the car wash.
198580,m606,wild things,L654706,u8912,KELLY,Deal.  You know I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
198581,m606,wild things,L654705,u8916,SAM,Okay try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
198583,m606,wild things,L655045,u8916,SAM,Just like that?
198585,m606,wild things,L655043,u8916,SAM,I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
198588,m606,wild things,L654898,u8916,SAM,I just want my life back...
198590,m606,wild things,L654896,u8916,SAM,There's nothing for them to get.
198592,m606,wild things,L654894,u8916,SAM,Nellie Gail Ranch...
198594,m606,wild things,L654892,u8916,SAM,What's that supposed to mean?
198597,m606,wild things,L654889,u8916,SAM,Can't you take that stupid thing off?
198598,m606,wild things,L654888,u8916,SAM,I know how deep her pockets are Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
198600,m606,wild things,L654886,u8916,SAM,Forget it.
198602,m606,wild things,L654884,u8916,SAM,Good thinking.
198603,m606,wild things,L654868,u8916,SAM,Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
198605,m606,wild things,L655350,u8914,RAY,Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want Kelly to be next then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
198607,m606,wild things,L655348,u8914,RAY,I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
198609,m606,wild things,L655346,u8914,RAY,Where is she?
198610,m606,wild things,L655345,u8914,RAY,Detective Duquette Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
198613,m606,wild things,L654804,u8914,RAY,You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
198614,m606,wild things,L655406,u8918,SUZIE,Hey Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
198615,m606,wild things,L655405,u8914,RAY,Sam for godsake.
198616,m606,wild things,L655402,u8918,SUZIE,Shoulda coulda woulda...  Get him in the water.
198617,m606,wild things,L655401,u8914,RAY,You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
198618,m606,wild things,L655168,u8914,RAY,That's right.  That was his name.
198619,m606,wild things,L655167,u8918,SUZIE,Davy.
198620,m606,wild things,L655164,u8918,SUZIE,Shut up.
198621,m606,wild things,L655163,u8914,RAY,Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You the pill-head with the rap sheet?
198622,m606,wild things,L655162,u8918,SUZIE,Get away from me.
198623,m606,wild things,L655159,u8914,RAY,Suzie Suzie... This is me Ray you're talking to.  We both know you don't have shit never have had shit never will have shit...
198624,m606,wild things,L655158,u8918,SUZIE,I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
198625,m606,wild things,L655157,u8914,RAY,Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
198626,m606,wild things,L655156,u8918,SUZIE,I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
198627,m606,wild things,L655155,u8914,RAY,You Kelly Sam.
198628,m606,wild things,L655154,u8918,SUZIE,Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
198629,m606,wild things,L655153,u8914,RAY,Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
198630,m606,wild things,L655152,u8918,SUZIE,About what?
198631,m606,wild things,L655151,u8914,RAY,Well you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
198632,m606,wild things,L655150,u8918,SUZIE,That's cop bullshit.
198633,m606,wild things,L655149,u8914,RAY,Yeah they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
198634,m606,wild things,L655148,u8918,SUZIE,You got something against cigarettes?
198635,m606,wild things,L655147,u8914,RAY,You ought to watch it with that shit Suzie.  You get busted again you go back in a two-tine loser.
198636,m606,wild things,L654971,u8918,SUZIE,Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
198637,m606,wild things,L654970,u8914,RAY,It doesn't look like it.
198638,m606,wild things,L654969,u8918,SUZIE,Will they?
198639,m606,wild things,L654968,u8914,RAY,No.
198640,m606,wild things,L654966,u8914,RAY,So Suzie you called us remember?
198641,m606,wild things,L654965,u8918,SUZIE,It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
198642,m606,wild things,L654963,u8918,SUZIE,I did.  At Blue Balls.
198643,m606,wild things,L654962,u8914,RAY,Meet my partner Gloria Perez.
198644,m606,wild things,L655397,u8916,SAM,Come off it man... It was an accident.
198645,m606,wild things,L655396,u8914,RAY,That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie get me to hang it on Kelly then dump me in the ocean...
198646,m606,wild things,L655395,u8916,SAM,Jesus man... You okay?
198647,m606,wild things,L655394,u8914,RAY,Yeah or get me drowned.
198648,m606,wild things,L655393,u8916,SAM,Come on man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
198649,m606,wild things,L655392,u8914,RAY,I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
198650,m606,wild things,L655391,u8916,SAM,Yes we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds and these are stays.
198651,m606,wild things,L655390,u8914,RAY,You mean this thing?
198652,m606,wild things,L655373,u8916,SAM,Kelly was supposed to be framed not killed.  What I'm telling you is I don't like surprises.
198653,m606,wild things,L655372,u8914,RAY,Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said only better.
198654,m606,wild things,L655371,u8916,SAM,Well shit you're the cop they don't teach you to disarm people shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
198655,m606,wild things,L655370,u8914,RAY,Hey what did you want me to do die?
198656,m606,wild things,L655369,u8914,RAY,The bitch shot me is what happened.
198657,m606,wild things,L655368,u8916,SAM,Yeah well you fixed that.  What the hell happened anyway?
198658,m606,wild things,L654925,u8914,RAY,Sit down Lombardo.
198659,m606,wild things,L654924,u8916,SAM,Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
198660,m606,wild things,L654923,u8914,RAY,With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra...
198661,m606,wild things,L654922,u8916,SAM,It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
198662,m606,wild things,L654921,u8914,RAY,But you do admit to touching her to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
198663,m606,wild things,L654916,u8916,SAM,That's right.
198664,m606,wild things,L654915,u8914,RAY,But she ran away.
198665,m606,wild things,L654912,u8916,SAM,Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday in the office.
198666,m606,wild things,L654911,u8914,RAY,And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
198667,m606,wild things,L654910,u8916,SAM,I could but it's confidential.  Look the point is we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
198668,m606,wild things,L654909,u8914,RAY,But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
198669,m606,wild things,L654908,u8916,SAM,Yes.
198670,m606,wild things,L654907,u8914,RAY,And she wanted to talk.
198671,m606,wild things,L654906,u8916,SAM,Yes.
198672,m606,wild things,L654905,u8914,RAY,In cutoffs a wet T-shirt.
198673,m606,wild things,L654904,u8916,SAM,Like I said I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room and there's Kelly.
198674,m606,wild things,L654903,u8914,RAY,The one you bought at school.
198675,m606,wild things,L654902,u8916,SAM,I had to go look for this coupon.
198676,m606,wild things,L654901,u8916,SAM,Story's the same Detective...
198677,m606,wild things,L654900,u8914,RAY,Why don't you tell us one more time how Kelly came to be with you alone in your house.
198678,m606,wild things,L655452,u8916,SAM,I think there's some things you do you don't want to see yourself doing them.
198679,m606,wild things,L655451,u8918,SUZIE,Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better that little straw Kelly's got up her nose or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think Mr. Lombardo?
198680,m606,wild things,L655450,u8916,SAM,How...
198681,m606,wild things,L655449,u8918,SUZIE,Well I'd need the famous Lombardo charm not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
198682,m606,wild things,L655448,u8916,SAM,We?
198683,m606,wild things,L655447,u8918,SUZIE,I've seen you out there in your old air boat thinking about what might have been old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
198684,m606,wild things,L655444,u8918,SUZIE,Trust me the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend.
198685,m606,wild things,L655443,u8916,SAM,Yeah real funny.  You're wrong about this I could get busted on the spot.
198686,m606,wild things,L655442,u8918,SUZIE,Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
198687,m606,wild things,L655420,u8918,SUZIE,Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
198688,m606,wild things,L655419,u8916,SAM,What's wrong?
198689,m606,wild things,L655415,u8916,SAM,That was the same thing Ray said.
198690,m606,wild things,L655414,u8918,SUZIE,What?
198691,m606,wild things,L655413,u8918,SUZIE,But then it is better this way don't you think?  No loose ends.
198692,m606,wild things,L655412,u8916,SAM,But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
198693,m606,wild things,L655411,u8918,SUZIE,The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
198694,m606,wild things,L655410,u8916,SAM,That was about as grim as it gets.
198695,m606,wild things,L655242,u8916,SAM,No no.  Look I probably should have told you a little more about the part I intended to play.  We'll go through it all again tonight.
198696,m606,wild things,L655241,u8918,SUZIE,Are you mad at me?
198697,m606,wild things,L655240,u8916,SAM,I was worried about you Suzie.  I decided we should all get together one more time before we split up.
198698,m606,wild things,L655191,u8916,SAM,Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that the only people who can fuck this up is us.
198699,m606,wild things,L655190,u8918,SUZIE,Yeah right.
198700,m606,wild things,L655188,u8916,SAM,Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
198701,m606,wild things,L655187,u8918,SUZIE,But I..
198702,m606,wild things,L655184,u8916,SAM,Put Kelly on too.
198703,m606,wild things,L655183,u8918,SUZIE,Sam...
198704,m606,wild things,L655097,u8916,SAM,Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
198705,m606,wild things,L655096,u8918,SUZIE,How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
198706,m606,wild things,L654778,u8916,SAM,Goodbye Sandra.
198708,m606,wild things,L654775,u8916,SAM,So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
198711,m606,wild things,L654771,u8916,SAM,Didn't you see her this morning?
198713,m606,wild things,L654769,u8916,SAM,No.
198715,m606,wild things,L654767,u8916,SAM,Sandy... What's up?
198716,m606,wild things,L654730,u8916,SAM,Swamp's where it's at Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.
198718,m606,wild things,L654728,u8916,SAM,Sorry Sandy.  I've got plans.
198720,m606,wild things,L654726,u8916,SAM,I can't Sandy.  I've got to run.
198721,m606,wild things,L654724,u8916,SAM,Can't.  Got a passenger.
198723,m606,wild things,L654722,u8916,SAM,Hi Sandy.
